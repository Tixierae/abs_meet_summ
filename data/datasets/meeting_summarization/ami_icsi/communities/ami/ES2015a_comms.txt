as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control
and so we have to come up with a way to create a remote control where
and your personal experiences with remote controls and there is you see that's i could be improved your experience with that
as find that in a house the remote control always "'cause" i think it's always so what
it's always so what is the remote control so maybe
tracking device of the remote control of some signal that you could find out where one from to them
to use not find that like there's a lot of buttons on your remote control and you don't know what i have and i don't know
some remote controls are those kind of a hidden panel it's all those buttons that you don't really use also programming or something that's useful
right anything about the look of the remote control day you might have ideas about maybe it could be

this is a television remote control
yes it's a television remote control

i'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase also
phase also the conceptual design and detailed design for the final product
i also be responsible for the functional design phase the conceptual design phase and the detailed design a off the user interface
a new product i'll be doing some trendwatching in the conceptual design and product evaluation for the design phase
use same with conceptual design and detailed design

as or perhaps ergonomic design
one thing we have to think about international used in the design of like different kinds of a v. c. r.s things like that
r.s things like that depending on which country you are other thing for the design
other thing for the design team to think about
if it's a trendy original aspect were going for you to design it you think
you to design it you think you can decide what kind of direction you wanna go in but at this point

like a shell shaped remote

and down just come up with the concept of what they want we want it to look like
do you have a look wake up for
office getting a might buy a look and
in a way looks kind of awkward because it on spending like say that
looks kinda like a power is saying
likely to be trying to keep the peace talks and c. and i need a looks and there's
i thought that's pretty on the line to buy a wanna be look at it for about two minutes or we should have a camera
or not need our budget but more but what kind of a selling range will be looking at
but we don't wanna go to look boring "'cause" that one side of the

you need to do the function f. eight
and then after we've brainstormed in and out but we can come together in a meeting and discuss what what kind of functional design we want to use same
you'll be beginning you were you're working design
u. i. d. the technical functions design will be worked on the next thirty minutes

call it was like also point to it than that
it's a great idea it's a good idea
any ideas we'll do you have this point

and as a sort of team building a moment i'd like us to try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal on the carrot characteristics of that animal
why that should be your favourite animal so
my favourite animal which changes all the time
buy a look and it is my favourite animal right now "'cause" it is a large beautiful majestic feature that
while you guys express your favourite animals
i think my favourite animal would be a talk but i
and there's just such friendly animals and
so that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow would seem to say that like spring is finally here

i've had a new project manager
my name's copy i am
name's copy i am the industrial designer for this project
my name's star i named the user interface designer i also
be doing today as was planning the projects how we're going to
one thing that so are we going to do is become acquainted with be that will so we have access to for our project one
industrial designer that's me
industrial designer have to remember these

and discuss but are in subject us on that so
the way that we're going to go about this is will have a time where we can come up with new idea it's a loan and then work on the project and then
this is the team building time where
it is discussion time so
time so that's the time for us to bring our initial ideas any suggestions that you may have so far and
but you can go over your ideas of course in your own personal times

completely new styles so that can really appeal to generation that doesn't want a simple plain that kind of channel changer and
there are two different types of dogs if it's than one kind of that
and then a kind is a green i think as a green range and there's
some kind of allow you can press
i. we going into it kind of novelty fact to see like i've seen
thing like a novelty thing my any sell a few things rather than like in general kind of more acceptable but we don't

welcome to the meeting every button
right this is the first meeting
this is the first meeting for developing we're a new product i've had
was the opening of the first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another for everyone to
at first i thought as a deadly if and then
the next thing we need to it rests is our financial department to meet our budget
in but at this point in the first meeting you can be any ideas that we just throw out there
or not present but bring to the meeting

not as artistic of have this during that not talking
that i've control talk and cepstral
i draw talk at school

how we're going to create this product and
and then it's feasible to create and down
we can like the price to create it will be significantly less
