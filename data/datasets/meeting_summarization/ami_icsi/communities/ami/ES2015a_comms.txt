so it's have to make this into a slide show
you need to do the function f. eight
i've had a new project manager
so that was the opening of
for everyone to go around and explain the role and and their name
phase also the conceptual design and detailed design for the final product
and it needs to be user-friendly for maybe if for example for people that can see the numbers as or
tool training as everyone
i'll go next i
a lot but i like also to animals that further when i'm gonna draw a cat in memory of mine look at that point we c. d.
it's gonna be the in the strange doing
not as artistic of have this during that not talking
likely to be trying to keep the peace talks and c. and i need a looks and there's
against cats don't really like me so we can like that but there's
but there's just a friendly and more mean i know but do a
it was actually doesn't know this part
do you hear the eraser buzzing you do that
we'd like to to make fifty million euro something that's the end
one thing we have to think about international used in the design of like different kinds of a v. c. r.s things like that
we want it to cost absent maximum of twelve euro and fifty cents

own i've i said i mean project manager
and discuss but are in subject us on that so
it's a process or an extra to actually is
and then it's feasible to create and down
one thing that so are we going to do is become acquainted with be that will so we have access to for our project one
three cows
that's really care right
it's as i said
you said was tend to think about it i'm
to think about it i'm going to draw a butterfly which is
a butterfly which is a butterfly yesterday that seem to be like the symbol of springer i think and is actually pretty is but
and then it landed on the wall next to me but this part was a brown
green range and there's like a red one i like this
doesn't know this part of the body was really tall and then i was like the most colourful exotic butterfly have an like once is not
an like once is not scotland in like march so

as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control
all real doing individually
we can like the price to create it will be significantly less
twelve fifty

something that's the end means
and make it for an international market one
some now that that is underway
it is discussion time so

i did twice
that's me too party
we want this to be a marker will product that can be trendy

this is the first meeting for developing we're a new product i've had
r.s things like that depending on which country you are other thing for the design
other thing for the design team to think about

my name's copy i am
name's copy i am the industrial designer for this project
kept some

i also be responsible for the functional design phase the conceptual design phase and the detailed design a off the user interface
leave it should be taking minutes on this right now so
the way that we're going to go about this is will have a time where we can come up with new idea it's a loan and then work on the project and then

yes it's a television remote control
and as a sort of team building a moment i'd like us to try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal on the carrot characteristics of that animal
or not need our budget but more but what kind of a selling range will be looking at

so i'm assuming
i'm assuming that we should do that now
i think my favourite animal would be a talk but i

it's really big arsehole you going out of its head
say that they can really overcome
they can really overcome harsh terrain there and

so i thought that's pretty on the
i thought that's pretty on the line to buy a wanna be look at it for about two minutes or we should have a camera
the next thing we need to it rests is our financial department to meet our budget

my name's star i named the user interface designer i also
and so we have to come up with a way to create a remote control where

an expert marketing i'll
this is a television remote control

pets and some for you
in a way looks kind of awkward because it on spending like say that

there and although would score just it's also very dangerous because it has strong antlers and
you can really combat its enemies even like it's a terrible bore that to really defend itself

that not talking about that
that i like cats because they're so independent and they always seem to be

doing but that doesn't mean i can see be not sociable "'cause" they enjoy a interacting with humans as and
as and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and ready around the outside as

at school with a lot on right
i like dogs because there so to him and it's likely to be trying

and like the more of a companion but then cat i have nothing
have nothing against cats

or we should have a camera so that's
at wanna make this as a selling price of twenty-five euros and so we have

right that nothing

welcome to the

welcome to the meeting every button

to stick

we'll have to deal with that like this then right

right this is the first meeting

was the opening of the first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another for everyone to

i'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase also

generate on the marketing expert an

i'll be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for a new product

a new product i'll be doing some trendwatching in the conceptual design and product evaluation for the design phase

you can pretty much read how to do is to do but

and tool training there's one thing that we're going to be doing today

be doing today as was planning the projects how we're going to

how we're going to create this product and

completely new styles so that can really appeal to generation that doesn't want a simple plain that kind of channel changer and

as or perhaps ergonomic design

and then after we've brainstormed in and out but we can come together in a meeting and discuss what what kind of functional design we want to use same

use same with conceptual design and detailed design

making that it's usable

and down just come up with the concept of what they want we want it to look like

training as everyone

one of them is our white board and

why that should be your favourite animal so

'kay with a microphone

with a microphone so test where but it's a cat

it's a cat

you could have it all real

this is the team building time where

my favourite animal which changes all the time

right now it is an elk right and

do you have a look wake up for

you have moves and we

we have moose two

you have moves and we have here

be a sheep

i would have a good artist

a sheep this is my

a shape way

office getting

brilliant

office getting a might buy a look and

buy a look and it is my favourite animal right now "'cause" it is a large beautiful majestic feature that

i'm gonna take minutes while

while you guys express your favourite animals

as as think inside an interim have to do and

to do and generally just they just seem to hold on to this know what to do it

it i reckon then sort of big a list of did that know what they

talk but i mean fish eye feature or i'm that

that i've control talk and cepstral

and cepstral snail "'cause" a job that i know really if you show

it's gonna be a really for me to or "'cause" i'm not where to draw at all

there are two different types of dogs if it's than one kind of that

that's not a quick so i

looks kinda like a power is saying

it's the nokia

i draw talk at school

and there's just such friendly animals and

but do a quick that

if you like a robot

you said was tend

and is actually pretty is but if i've ever seen i mean the wild that speak once

wild that speak once call it was like

call it was like also point to it than that

at first i thought as a deadly if and then

but this part was a brown and then have these big blue dots like this and then a kind is a

and then a kind is a green i think as a green range and there's

scott like the peacock

so that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow would seem to say that like spring is finally here

so now we know how to use the whiteboard

so we'll have a ninety percent profit on twelve fifty

and that and they have kept
