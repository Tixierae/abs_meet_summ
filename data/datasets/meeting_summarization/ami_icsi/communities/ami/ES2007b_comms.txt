alright welcome to the meeting be
this is gonna go a lot but in the last meeting "'cause" no
talking and i'm gonna be making notes and sending them up to the power supply and
just coming in those
the way it's fine on my screen got
in the so the overlaps with the marketing person a because
because we need to find out what people want before we make firm decisions on this so
and our motto is we put the fashion in electronics
we put the fashion in electronics they
i think we have to carry that middle
so it's gonna go that it's gotta look in new and you know something fashionable if remote control
ergonomic you know there's you know my three computers are very ergonomically keyboards and
fantastic about are going
about are going to be we said
we said just plug in baby
this is getting a little tank
function f. eight
so maybe tracking device is a good idea
so you do so that's something we should have a look and see then it went is that when designing you know it's it say

no problem
or you know it you are you just doing some internet shopping there
the presentation wasn't very clear but
what we can perfect little bit as far as design that we don't wanna
top down keys for that channel
channel keys up down but that also numerical
it's rather busy there are so let's a player movie stop really fast forward of this freeze frame in this
judging from what we are talked about during our last meeting a kind of gather that's what we're going after another direction
another direction that we're going in at least
so the engineering centred one is provide a lot of functionality but it can be a little bit overwhelming
with that current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user
and they also a remote to get lost in the room so and then we can find them so
so reef sense

if you haven't done a powerpoint thing it doesn't matter it
screen got no mic so
you're in the room you can
we was that we're designing our marketing television remote control unit we're not
so this is warming up there this
and as far as methods i was looking it looking at already existing remote trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there
look into i've had
so we don't like the look of the remote control eighty
that's another thing
seventy five cents of users say they zap
i think that's flicking quickly between channels
i'm looking for for doing what any medical that can we go find out about this

that's good idea
and kathryn with the c. a. t. h.
this is a bit according to what the names i think
you what you've been working on for the last way while when you haven't been
when you haven't been getting hit with spam when you're computers and you don't thing at city questionnaires and things but hopefully
whoa talk about what we actually need as a final coming together that all
thirty percent of the users say they only use ten percent of the buttons on the remote so
floppy up to the age of thirty five saying they wanna

i was gonna do a powerpoint presentation
then we're gonna have what you know from age your presentations whoa
this meeting is a little it's probably don't about thirty five minutes now so a range
so a range of your presentations to not be too long five minutes something like that
when i hear from you first
but that also numerical keypad so that they can use key directly to the channel that they want rather than going up down and

are sort of inspiration for it i've never seen that
i've never seen that with and then all my years and in the remote business
if remote control what i've telephones can be fashionable then maybe remote control units can be
we can so we talk about the layout in my presentation why didn't
my presentation why didn't mention it really is this a sort of like the ergonomic design that
everything is going to ergonomic you know there's

then if you like fifteen to twenty five this is ages
five this is ages are with that a script the fifteen to twenty
older generation but the younger generation who we are catering for like for some money nowadays do want to watch that speech recognition in remote
but to the younger generation have the money they don't is
they don't is older generation of the ones are gonna
the twenty five to thirty five euro and thirty five to forty five point seven percent what so you know so

what about this from the perspective of our manufacturing cost and you know if it's
and you know if it's twelve fifty per unit i
voice activation might not be the best
also with with buttons i think called r. s. i. e. so reef
that they have a lunchbreak

gabriel
so voice activation so
the fifteen to twenty five said like to write one percent of them said yes
one and needed to be older generation but

or are you are the bus right
so user centre once you should focus on ease of use
that you know being physical look into
design that i think we can make big improvements over this to you see here i mean

but this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting
how about the lady
so the using infra-red it's good to
much we just like flat buttons be

maybe i dunno solar cells
i don't know so i thought i think changing your batteries once every six months it's not really a pain for
it works for the last fifty years
that's as i look at question for and this is

that we don't wanna do something that's too radical the change i i
but now than others so that most
so that most people that have the money people from the age of thirty five to fifty five it "'cause" that was
that's that's quite a mono in as a team like

so this is researcher we also gave participants
we also gave participants question i have to fill out total
total number of people tested one hundred just so you know so that
so you know so that hundred people tested and these were the findings so

this function f. eight or something
can show
so this is engineer centred one so you see

but hopefully b. s. c. been doing something productive so are we gonna
if you're gonna give is that a little presentation
or suggestions

it only gets a right let's
is a battery like the only way of
mean maybe we what we would strong signal string

to base it is and you can say when
and you blow on it and
one thing that can include here i forgot that we talked about last time was doing some sort of lock a function

you done that's why that's going in just a
you are tell the technology are you
i think he something easy to use especially for older people

i've got a very quick
a new remote especially for the older generation i know my
i know my grammar but this like mobile phones things

and bursts and that will send to use the telly itself and infrared signal to use which are warm or switch channels
should i erase this or
i would say sky i'd say scrap that's trade off

down i don't know if you guys have any questions for testing on any this
has to look really flashing would be people to buy it and it's
maybe the buttons so how so you don't to press so much we just like flat

can gabrielle let's say let's say from you on that as soon as
do you need the board or
and this can use the powerpoint

this is all we set so you've been doing look at look in another you know existing it's
no that seemed like a novel ideas for as far as i know i mean
for as far as i know i mean another that existed like you said in the mobile phones are sort of inspiration

remote control unit is gonna look like it's an i. r. and r.
you know it become money it's from all i can say from other products and yellow with blue going on them
and it just sticks we

in quick first
one so you see it's rather busy there are

just like "'cause" i thought i really don't have anyone's names are just
i'll this can leave this up here "'cause"

"'cause" no one's was wondering but all i'm
maybe and also we asked them whether they funded whether they'd be interested in voice activated

it doesn't matter it's just say see it's that's just one particular
we all know that it's a remote control we're gonna be dealing with i think the first thing we

that's just one particular meeting if you have
and a mute button one thing that

meeting if you have no time to prepare one you can draw on that note board didn't talk to
board didn't talk to us you can you know

you can you know however you wanna do you all know presentation you can
not so pressurised into using this thing "'cause"

you can't see of flying
it's in blue i can change the way it's fine on my

which in our case will
then right so i think maybe to you batteries i dunno what they call

i dunno what they call a lot sex
and of the chip will be controlled by the user interface

so we'll hear about that later from gabriel and
technical and see

we can make the signal strong enough to go through goals if you want to
cost more and i'm not it's you gonna use it

is that the signal
repetitive strain injury right

the change i i mean people want a remote that's familiar that has their favourite functionalities and does the basics but
so we can improve what's out there anything that the basic functionality that people want

it's i don't know if i can access the web page you can show
a as a team like fifty that's thirty five percent

to be in a staring at for five minutes and i
and i judging from

i mean i've never seen marking functionality
i dunno what you guys have a year on a good feeling about whether that's really necessary

those are only used up and down channel
is running or five channels

so the majority seven forty five to fifty five euros for some reason didn't want a voice activated one and needed to be
no i would say the older people

it "'cause" that was been working for twenty years
considering get icsi define the l. the next meeting

strain injury so they don't think
they don't think people watch t. v. maybe to what think you change and channel that's the rest i

maybe it could be instead of pressing but then it could be just touching
we just one disk of losses so that people are gonna so this in ten years time say your remote control get mean the best a strain injury

names are just for one thing done and it's marketing this system is that at the bundy know you names again i'll this can leave

rice or are you are

double s. a.

but all i'm your project manager and

in speech of the eyes between the three and get

and get things going get people talking and

what this meeting is all about is and i have some presentations from all three of you what you've been working

and then we'll be able to also conclude than anything else comes up again do that

i have five

a you have a you joining in this meeting here or you know it

she's finishing up her presentation

and then i've been missing off a presentation

i think the first thing we should look at is probably be what it is such as opposed to base it is and you

so the working design have got a very quick presentation on this so

i'm gonna draw it on the board it's in blue

a lot sex or something like that

then on the remote control itself will have baby send if for the signal which could

which could be an infrared signal

which will be cents buy it an electronic chip

that's it really for the working design

a bit of other top five you meant as personally

get this i would i just wanna copy this down

it's just you don't want it plugged in really is

all to the energy source like when power

in tools

bicycle power

that is like it's that there's always changing batteries can get like annoying the battery's down and

the battery's down and maybe

one question i have i don't know how much control

i don't know how much control we have over this is as far as the infra-red

as far as the infra-red signal do we have control over know how far away you can be from the receiving you know that the t. v. and still have it be operational mean

alpha always your television

it's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be in a unless you got t. v. there's also a football but it's not doesn't have to go that far does it doesn't

that far does it doesn't have to go through a wall because you know they're looking through a wall

but if like you on the phone the other room we need to the television or something you don't really want to go and we put the time for them to go into

i just think that it's gonna cost more and

sounds like you have a good year it on a overcomplicate things you know we don't need

you know we don't need it

it's the fancy idea it's quite but

either you will if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room you

we're not the wood designer some way you can plug in a headset to end and you know connect your laptop computer and so

we can keep the idea if you

we can see the latest age maybe it up

so i'm doing the user interface design

thinking of what we can retain what we can do away with what

so the things that seem like absolute must have this would be a volume control

i don't know that's one possibility

and so on the research that i was doing there's two types of remotes ones that are

of remotes ones that are engineering centred in ones that are more user centred it's i

in this as a user centred one it's

it's easier to just go into this and see what's possible to be in a staring

but it can be a little bit overwhelming so user

have you fans that anyone else to just looked into the locking functional

i would say it's if it's simple to do

in it is a physical enough of like a physical switch or physical cover for the remote in something like that then it's

it's know like you know like she said only one up a flip thing something that you know being

i've had a word down from head off that's something we should be centre that so we should take into account is we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit

keyboards and that could be one of our niche is sort of the in the market i

the blue think

then you should have to do function f. eight and should come

just takes a second

from marketing report we observed remote control users in usability lab and

and also so this is researcher

so it's at five percent of users find the remote control ugly so we don't

eighty percent of them would spend more money if the what remote control look really fancy i think we

i think we all agree with that

so they don't like the way they operate it doesn't

operate it doesn't that much how people

on the remote so probably if you have like one two three four five the whole out of ten they probably don't use those are only used up

exactly i that's another thing

you wanna navigate the channels quickly i

text

text was time to learn how to use a new remote

mobile phones things i used to use anyway

hassle i

and it's easy to for whom i so

activation so and this was what we came up with then if you like

people table for me i just if there's a big job of the floppy

repetitive strain rip repetitive strain

repetitive strain injury so

maybe not so hot

say i'm looking for

we should probably console with our legal department

they have a lunchbreak at the moment but considering

i think we can do some real in our department that the ergonomic department we can make some really good improvements

so we've by city
