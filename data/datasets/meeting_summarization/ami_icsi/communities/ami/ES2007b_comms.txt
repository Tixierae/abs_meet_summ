so it's gonna go that it's gotta look in new and you know something fashionable if remote control
so we don't like the look of the remote control eighty
eighty percent of them would spend more money if the what remote control look really fancy i think we
they will go to look at this remote control and it in disney recogniser that's a real reaction product

we was that we're designing our marketing television remote control unit we're not
i've never seen that with and then all my years and in the remote business
i've had a word down from head off that's something we should be centre that so we should take into account is we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit
remote control unit is gonna look like it's an i. r. and r.
if remote control what i've telephones can be fashionable then maybe remote control units can be
and you know if it's twelve fifty per unit i
this know but i mean is any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years because

we all know that it's a remote control we're gonna be dealing with i think the first thing we
then on the remote control itself will have baby send if for the signal which could
and of the chip will be controlled by the user interface
i don't know how much control we have over this is as far as the infra-red
so the things that seem like absolute must have this would be a volume control
of remotes ones that are engineering centred in ones that are more user centred it's i
from marketing report we observed remote control users in usability lab and
so it's at five percent of users find the remote control ugly so we don't
with that current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user

that far does it doesn't have to go through a wall because you know they're looking through a wall
and as far as methods i was looking it looking at already existing remote trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there
this is all we set so you've been doing look at look in another you know existing it's

i think the first thing we should look at is probably be what it is such as opposed to base it is and you
have you fans that anyone else to just looked into the locking functional
that you know being physical look into
has to look really flashing would be people to buy it and it's
i'm looking for for doing what any medical that can we go find out about this
it's gonna be safe to use is gonna look
is gonna look it's kind of cheap
not necessary even if it's just has to do it be have to look at
so maybe so you can have a look at our other products and see if i owe follows similar line perhaps

and so on the research that i was doing there's two types of remotes ones that are
in it is a physical enough of like a physical switch or physical cover for the remote in something like that then it's
text was time to learn how to use a new remote
and they also a remote to get lost in the room so and then we can find them so

thirty percent of the users say they only use ten percent of the buttons on the remote so
so the majority seven forty five to fifty five euros for some reason didn't want a voice activated one and needed to be
the twenty five to thirty five euro and thirty five to forty five point seven percent what so you know so
floppy up to the age of thirty five saying they wanna
so that most people that have the money people from the age of thirty five to fifty five it "'cause" that was
a as a team like fifty that's thirty five percent

you what you've been working on for the last way while when you haven't been
it works for the last fifty years

and get things going get people talking and
the change i i mean people want a remote that's familiar that has their favourite functionalities and does the basics but
so we can improve what's out there anything that the basic functionality that people want
one thing that can include here i forgot that we talked about last time was doing some sort of lock a function
because we need to find out what people want before we make firm decisions on this so
operate it doesn't that much how people
people table for me i just if there's a big job of the floppy
they don't think people watch t. v. maybe to what think you change and channel that's the rest i

this meeting is a little it's probably don't about thirty five minutes now so a range
so a range of your presentations to not be too long five minutes something like that
to be in a staring at for five minutes and i
if we sit for finished five minutes before the meeting supposed to finish saying that means we are next five minutes for lunch

what this meeting is all about is and i have some presentations from all three of you what you've been working
so the working design have got a very quick presentation on this so
that's it really for the working design
it "'cause" that was been working for twenty years
everybody had in their work

a bit of other top five you meant as personally
is running or five channels
seventy five cents of users say they zap

down i don't know if you guys have any questions for testing on any this
one question i have i don't know how much control
that's as i look at question for and this is
we also gave participants question i have to fill out total
any questions everybody had

we're not the wood designer some way you can plug in a headset to end and you know connect your laptop computer and so
so i'm doing the user interface design
what we can perfect little bit as far as design that we don't wanna
my presentation why didn't mention it really is this a sort of like the ergonomic design that
design that i think we can make big improvements over this to you see here i mean
so you do so that's something we should have a look and see then it went is that when designing you know it's it say
now come back to the industrial designer that you know

then if you like fifteen to twenty five this is ages
five this is ages are with that a script the fifteen to twenty
the fifteen to twenty five said like to write one percent of them said yes
