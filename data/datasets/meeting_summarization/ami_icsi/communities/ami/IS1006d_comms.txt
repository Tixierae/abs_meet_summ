yes four buttons
four buttons and yes and
that's four buttons the buttons

you can use it now my switch channels as buttons so first i present
and we have some l. c. d. controls like in a switch in the l. c. d. display if you want to use that c. d. or you don't want you can use a normal button and we have
let's control button
and the buttons just normal

you mean we can change the colour or a one
so you change colours
change the colour i mean that's very

and so you know buttons and using l. c. d. or like you can use these in stock real and select each other option one that c. d. and then you on and off then
know all these buttons are you not clear but you
the two buttons you do is this like that one "'em" up volume down or if you go
that's for didn't use one arm the to the television on button you have to
they use it with that too deep the two buttons and true
buttons the buttons soft and that's
buttons are all standard buttons it's only buttons
and the buttons are not colour eyes
so the point is that when you take the device and push the button you produce enough energy

be seen special colour
special colour or it's funny and
special colours
special colour
not special colours and so

this is our remote control
you can use a base my remote control or
remote control or are you can use be some nicknamed your remote control like ball we're going and then if
as you know before going and you're creating in producing these it's from the reuse remote control it's very percent of users say if it makes sense if we have a chance to set it so we need to be evaluated
from one to seven and then we're just going to have an average which we give us these bad you of our remote control so
so the question is do you have that than minimum requirement of a remote control so i don't
so you feel a key something a protection for the remote control
we have at their remote controls to create

of like still you can look at your remote itself
and then you can see the look and see v. and all the sweetest
so maybe we can have a look at the criteria
just look at that it's four led up to there
but it's flat to look
look this garbled but
if a look at what is the most expensive things that it's d. a. c. d. and this
so was the results that's a look
maybe put mine is too much so it looks or is it a little

and you can choose colours on your day for eats d. or even many colours
and you can have many colours on weekends or
in the controller many different colours are different fruits and

then you'll have volume control so you
it's i had these is volume control and ten a genius these are the main

but nobody's being tuesday colour
even you can call in favour you colours for its they're doing on your more north
colour and shape
also colour it seems that we have the role colours for the l. c. d. and
and it's not very clear what is the colour of this dish the case is a
but there is normal colour here so
i think you know as you can use more for wood colours

so or do we still fruits minutes
fruits minutes probably so you can

it's looks euros useful

so we need to be evaluated and tried to do it in account stuck if we need as much as we can
i have needs to pick it
so how many batteries do we need one battery
but you don't need a battery
to make electricity that you don't need a battery
that you don't need a battery so

and then some you will propose some great to you could criteria to evaluate this prototype then
prototype and i think we now need all together to try to evaluate it to see if we make sense to do it if it for the fees our what are you wanted to and things like that so

no the whole do next
the whole do next in this meeting is that
