new more so we do we need to consider that in the functionality of the remote control and
function the blue but i think for the controller

control and that also suggested that we we only used a remote control to control the television not v. c. r. d. v. c. or anything else having
and i think that you were saying about televising the control of maybe

not if you had a look at the other and control not example
that might be one other consideration which would be the transmission between the remote control and the t. v. for example

but in a day we don't look at the technology but we look at the function first

just be technical functions design
ones got on the basic functions but
but i think the basic functions the logica transmitter and the receiver and

did a basic thing is there's a user interface with people
and also things that based on what the user interface requires they were more functionality that

for example if we have audio controls those could be something people setup very rarely maybe they're and
most people use only of it's very slim portion of all the controls so
is installing new remote control something that people

and it you think maybe that's the only kind of essential requirements and then maybe
it's always kind of top to the device you ideally want them to hold it to them it you may not require
maybe make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold in those

i think a year you may be kind of thinking what we have so you have to have on what would be
that's like we're kind of weird sort of getting in two years meeting different design features together today
that and something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe make it

so if you wanna cripple the different kind of types of functions together you know that's

functions but it's in size is the e. d. parties one and
and this is very have to access it down functions there's nothing
do we have any functions them but one on i mean so far
i don't know maybe just at this point decide on what we must have it as a function of this
at idiap function f. eight
a it's something that can be used to fulfil function but in
think we should maybe you wanna go back to what the functions are i think
and also to find the actual functions of what's gonna do we do a recap
it says optional functions

so what's gonna keep it simple and all this control the t. v. and the other thing
they tend to use the most simple controls and overall

right is that were you were kind of like sorting
were kind of like sorting that are we actually eliminating things we just don't want product

like design the basics i think
design the basics i think that in the back of our minds we know what the basics are just change channels just
change volume but in my specifics which one of the basic so you try to target are there
i you have or have a design as a basic so

in and most users are they've used for really use the value of buying batteries and putting it into the control but
the control but unless the control is gonna consume a lot of batteries like he's
