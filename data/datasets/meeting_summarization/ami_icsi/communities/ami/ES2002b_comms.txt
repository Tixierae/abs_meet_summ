let me and
i have "'cause" i'd have a little bit and i call familiar with all the equipment and started
i mean today is that something they want actually written on it "'cause" it's
it is and broke it right
example is a very simple ones got on the basic
like a lot of what i've right and prepare for this meeting if it's a real closely with what craig that is gone over to impart i could
i think it's good to the same size but it's got much fewer buttons it's
know what it does so maybe you know it you know you get a lot of remote
were kind of like sorting that are we actually eliminating things we just don't want product
can this plug come across
to me so we'll just read to together
so to find them ugly most
the vast majority would spend more money for to look fancy as we'll see later
as we'll see later vast majority would spend more money for slightly more intuitive controls such as voice recognition i'm gonna we'll
frustrations
frustrations they get lost
keyboards something that is quite to expunge or if you want
expunge or if you want audio you want visual and you have those
the ten digits strain injury
is installing new remote control something that people
else found that most people would
know if that's possible we might consider getting into it
it just explains how to process goes through from the
a battery or something to keep it going and
is user what it has to decide what the user's telling the device and
the device and the device has to you know based on you push button a so i'll do something and it's maybe button is a power
maybe button is a power button on
i think that's all i don't like design it's

it's not a way but teletext only control the t. v. and and incorporate the colour and slogan of the company
right i used to using
i used to using about your laptop
just be technical functions design
this is have a complete once a lotta buttons for scholars very confusing you don't know what you're doing and
doubly fit the advanced functions maybe it in a drawer and they because
and then others that are concealed something like that
so you know disk
and you watch t. v.
i think you be the mid-range the higher market in terms of people "'cause"
don't know i you pay what kind with the remote like a simple replacement
remote like a simple replacement right i mean
do that these are the age groups which we had information on in these are this is
in these are this is a table of what people would pay more for a certain feature just give this a rough
we going to go walking like a with
to use speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use
but what i'm saying is that we're kind of a console since those particular kind of technology rather than
a it's something that can be used to fulfil function but in
from the basic technology point of view the basic steps that you need
and that power source is important because it ties
did a basic thing is there's a user interface with people
interface with people want a button or talk into it or small to it one thing then i use whatever you know and that
rather than having the thing that we don't have enough of so it's not really constrain

and to be clunky have a
mike and that and then
which is the twenty one and after that
split one is the one the right
down and that is that they teach the t. v.
goal think maybe a little bit about the what we just wanna be x. easily accessible for example if we have audio
for example if we have audio controls those could be something people setup very rarely maybe they're and
most people use only of it's very slim portion of all the controls so
they get lost a lot as
and i will admit i don't know what r. s. i. stands for
you know it's like i can find a lot of t. v.s these days something really button is if you wanna just turn "'em" on and off you can but
what are the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is here are gonna be and he's are our target audience or target market
that's like we're kind of weird sort of getting in two years meeting different design features together today
how for you can transmit a signal or
and the power are things that you want have to care about and also things
and also things that based on what the user interface requires they were more functionality that

internet is nobody uses teletext very much new more so
control and that also suggested that we we only used a remote control to control the television not v. c. r. d. v. c. or anything else having
i'll go first
any kind of you get
any of the end and that to that at all know
but i'm my hope
if you'd have the money to spend if
might have been a good idea is that all deliver presentations and then discuss but this
basics on right just the
i'm it ties you down perhaps a bit later on to the technology is how for
signal or the complexity of the functions that you want like for example
it's a basic principles and basic components then you get for example
but i think the basic functions the logica transmitter and the receiver and

and it you think maybe that's the only kind of essential requirements and then maybe
can this reach can this plug
and f. eight
you have to push it together
one thing on top
kinda like when you look at you know a new computer keyboards something
so here's another to the or if you hear the main things else found that
now at currently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology remote control so i don't
and again here as we sort of move in sort of thing starting about how we wanna sell in market best i
market best i think a recurring theme here is the company wants to be was to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy people
people are additionally are liking be appearance of their product so
but not let that can find s. technologically
any comments on all of that

so hopefully of been working away and i've put the minutes
and or just the idea i'm not so something we can
so something we can discuss as
so if they see why it you know you might perfect simpler design be you do want to recycle
be you do want to recycle and you know what it does so
i think it's a we're doing right now as a categorising were saying
a categorising were saying we want this to be product that off was all that sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area is that
what is that a point is that the last
i'm my hope your is it i'm putting it is information so we can and say how do we collectively move on with that and i
so that's not shy way for something quite high tech that's that's
tech that's that's a good point

and this is very have to access it down functions there's nothing
there's nothing for instance for slow motion button
required i mean there's no when it is gonna buy a remote control these days so if you can't actually individually select house mean where anybody disagree
what else to do a way but teletext
to do a way but teletext and it sort
or overlap between what is that a point
of their product so we wanna think about as we take all that to do the techie features how we can then put that into the unit which as which people like you know they like
you know they like the aesthetics and ergonomics
are this finding things is a bit confusing so i'll go
microphone a menu are the things so that's one
so it's come for "'cause" that's one function but i think

i don't know maybe just at this point decide on what we must have it as a function of this
one way i look at this would be that we approach the different controls in terms of like control type so that for the user
that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where the goal goal
just switched them
i think the trends and also they're
and you watch t.
it somebody's not gonna just use remote that comes at their telly i suppose are gonna
i suppose are gonna i stick one by one so
so you do think we're aiming this
a regular not i mean

we find the exact do we have to have not that
to the older group
young you know they have that as expendable income spend on the sort of thing
good to get ideas that they're fresh in mind
and the technology was so now what could be a and it's again
design the basics i think that in the back of our minds we know what the basics are just change channels just
just change channels just change volume but
i you have or have a design as a basic so

so one so that's kate and it's easy to use a big priorities
big priorities
so you know disk looking at what craig craig's like ideas there is so tell me that maybe we wanna do is try and separate the different things that we wanna include a if
wanna include a if we do you say we want there to be all the technology or we try and make that almost be like optional technology you know it's
you can but there though panels are you click and it's just like tons of features you go through
so if you wanna cripple the different kind of types of functions together you know that's
idea although my sense is that what we should try and think about it what are the current trends in materials in shapes and styles and then use that but not let that
where's the money maybe

which is the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is like this it's because of a popular the internet is nobody
of course it does like it by functions which are
section whistles and
so one and i just pick up and we have
function the blue but i think for the controller
roo area
and overall define remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them so i think we're

that's this an example if you and so i'm
and so i'm pretty you know
complicated be and everything is wireless in there
this is what i found here
but you need
right which you have a microphone the r. and like that
sister series however kind of modular as a normal thing

and they because at the bottom of it
it's just a spare any kind of
complicated and p. or a cheap i. p. r. a. t. thing is incredibly confusing so
so but sixteen seventeen pounds i think
too is that a lot of money to buy extra remote or a replacement remote right
on the diagram in this like probably works but

we need to the one about my business
you one is that we want a something that high-tech we want it to seen easy and in
a lot as it came up in our last meeting
terms of
who are familiar with the computers in there could be work i
this you know that it's saying all it's only use it in the couch that's like we're kind

like i have your larger
just before i bring this up a lot to say is what i've done is try to collect information so that i can relate this to you guys that it's now become the quite the thing and then kindly this
i think in a practical way we can dunno what it is we use it were from
a with it but we caught we have an arrow down exactly what the things we try to fulfil like
right just the idea is just to get everybody to i you

go through so i'm thinking here but primarily about customer needs that we start with the
do you think than a voice recognition is something we should really consider
does it was they adults that were going for that was a connection to the older
because based on what you've you everybody saying that you want something simple you want basic
you want basic and you want something that's easy to use speech recognition

eight so anybody anything that are just
that are just kind of young professionals and
what you give us your presentation and then we can
it's very general and
and i the purpose of this is also not restricted in the we are thinking like

discuss as so is the three things it's not a way
i think a year you may be kind of thinking what we have so you have to have on what would be
that's a good idea
i think it probably quite expensive to it and

ones got on the basic functions but
and on off one channel and skipped certain channels with the numbers
we the people were gadgety right people
right already seen

have a big number much you start buttons
and we should also have a quite one or a pressed upon that
so fifteen to thirty five it fairly young you know
it's all it's just putting the rest into words but it's essentially the

which are like like have and controls
with that and i haven't brought out one specific marketing idea although my sense
kind of you know much i
right i mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you'd wanna go and get which you can measure

so that you're preferences
we can chat away for for five minutes or so i think at most government
like kind of
this is our technology options in that sense this is just

what do you want to finish up your little presentation and are you a real time
what i've done or less
are you a real time
like on the means that is that on

of it all set so it may say you've got half
and then actual numbers for channels as
rather than focusing on exactly what other features that we're gonna say and then you know say speech recognition is good for the speech recognition is not that this so maybe we should

that time for presentations
can be channels like the numbers on it
any kind of like display controls that or do you think we need to worry about you know brightness

and that makes a why does
not if you had a look at the other and control not example
right is that were you were kind of like sorting

my own practices type very the country one and
this can attach
which you can measure

to impart i could use my personal preferences but across
preferences but across that at some of this which is just that so the the market research but anyway
that is that on the top of the technology it are there any like what our options and what's what

we'll stick to ten if you're gonna
so that makes sense so what i
sense so what i got as i'm just looking this information and sort of try

of the coverage a button down and
i think i it's a valid point i mean like
if we can move on to the next presentation and case

thing open and that's a good idea it's a good
it's a good idea
you get for example if you need that if you need it to add voice recognition right then the user interface with display broken

the numbers are they are
no i would say that's required i mean
change volume but in my specifics which one of the basic so you try to target are there

maybe they're and they're they're not area the covered up things like
complicated be
like it for me this or like three different inspirations you one

things like channel and volume are used all the time so
all the time so we just have them right out on top
on top very just very self explanatory so maybe

i'm gonna we'll look at that the second
so i we're looking at here's people want this technology they tend to use the most
they tend to use the most simple controls and overall

work i mean people who were maybe but i wouldn't say thirty five but
say thirty five but people or up for edition above now i would not be so would depend rely on a computer or mobile phone or something like that we the people were
you need some power source a battery

but i everybody does it have some ideas i don't think of
bit confusing so i'll go into that then press it just explains
the basic steps that you need on the diagram

all ready to go
on it needs to be able to send a signal to the device itself just to see here

and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder
so i don't know if that's possible

and started to discuss but that's about the project you cost-wise how much money we had this
and just want to tell you that we have three new requirements which is

new more so we do we need to consider that in the functionality of the remote control and
i thought this is the case may as as if we make

anything else having to worry is that if the project becomes too complex and it'll affect how long it takes is to get it into the into production the time to market so
written on it "'cause" it's quite long

and the slogan like the actual written slogan are just embodied the idea of the slogan
and others that are and also available and then others that are concealed

that because on the company website was it's a
but putting the fashion in electronics

so it'd be if any of that really
so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings a controls you know

you look at existing products have found that a testament of the extremes this is
functions but it's in size is the e. d. parties one and

point i mean like the one unless it's quite quite complicated and
not that we can add things that are possible

do we have any functions them but one on i mean so far
on i mean so far i've got a on off and switch channel up and down and volume up and down and

our that out west and rubber both we find the exact
what is to wrap up quickly on this little section whistles

and then maybe just things that would be if it could say would be things like or do you set us up and display set up and things like that maybe like
like that maybe like a mute button that sort of thing

this is may not the city than thing but
'cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through so

but what i've already started doing is it created a slide and in my presentation is
so that we can if you think what's accumulate the fact of what we've taken from your ideas and mine because certainly

know we could do what kind of decisions we could take away from and
take away from and then maybe by the end of this looking at some of these things we can think about what our priorities "'cause" certainly there's lots of

want more the issues that with existing products i think the trends
so if we want something that looks good it's it's easy to use but has is very powerful product whatever you do we really want in that "'cause" i mean

and also they're trying connect that is you see with the company version which is the
version which is the fashion in electronics

a lot of this is a new to me so we'll
and in spite of the parameters side of it and a very high-tech side we want it to just be in appealing piece of equipment in people's hands

them ugly most people find them ugly
control so that doesn't just look like a big panel kinda like

takes time to learn how to use this is
this is why mentioned craig was showing is some ideas that we actually trying group control so that doesn't

'cause twenty five euros for a remote how much that will clean
so maybe not a high end range but maybe middle up which kind

this can attach is on your comments or do that these are the age
already seen one before

mostly focused around that twenty five age group
sort of young professional kind of

it does fit with the market that would sort of identifying terms of
so i the rest i think we should maybe

i'm saying that target these people and give them what they want and
give them what they want and "'cause" you know it then it's do some kind of selling point eight so

the group as "'cause" that's more than half euro people who are willing to at least try you should technology
but it's essentially the same thing you have

but in a day we don't look at the technology but we look at the function first
try to find what we're trying to get done i think in a practical

this is just a working
rate on it's something

you know and that picks up and input from the user
from the user logic is user what it

it's something which is important than we just an apart rather than having the
of so it's not really constrain that sense but

say you've got half an hour for this one and two discuss the the functional design all ready

so i just to recap on what we did last time

so what's gonna keep it simple and all this control the t. v. and the other thing

and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design

i'm not entirely what the corporate colour is it

is it might be yellow because it's used will be a little freer

if any of that really the recap at all that

time for presentations and he would

and he would like to go first

and in that case that we bring to be very that's

it's easier the buttons here and here it is and

that was for a note broker and that makes a why

country one and it's very easy to use

the how long we've got

most government anyway

and clunky in what sense like i have

you get a bit about the size of the

you know you get a lot of remote controls we kind of thing open and that's

mean where anybody disagree that

to worry about you know brightness and contrast

this it's a far just to recap we've got volume and channel control and

a controls you know like one which are just to be a bit role ones that should be right within your natural group and others

i don't know whether this is for good or for bad that they'll

good or for bad that they'll be a lot of kind of redundancy in the in many the issues and the things

because certainly i have a hard time separating set brings completely

hard to know would worry real answer

completely where you just holding it where you just forming in fact a lot on want like market research thing that ivan so how do i have

at idiap function f. eight

and then kindly this in the direction deciding "'kay" what our options which we decide and johanna

and johanna mean so

and sort of try to think about how we could reviewed know we could do what

needs that we start with the customer and

customer and we're what they want more the issues

and then as i say i would like to prioritise the design features from s. and

users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls so to find

so i think we're gonna try to take like it for me this

people would adults at least would pay more for voice recognition now at

if like twenty five euro is our selling price and you can imagine

just give this a rough idea of where they with the wheel to spend money on t. v. it could mean it's mostly

it's eighty think we're aiming at a fairly young market then

like if we are going to include speech recognition is kind of between fifteen and thirty five seats be like a really high response to that so

so we could say that was our target

i think twenty five to thirty five is fair to add that in the group as "'cause"

i think that's it could be significant as "'cause" those are people who use a computer who

gadgety right people were you going are used to it you know it's cold in universities we going

a with a regular not

so we made the decision i had to include speech recognition if we can

i think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now because

we can activate it to the

i suggest that we think about speech recognition a it's

but this is higher

as as if we make it speech rec if we incorporate speech recognition that's appealing to people maybe with of physical disability as

and not losing and also helps

and also helps in terms of people not using this you know that

right and one problem speech recognition is like if

is like if you want them used and

be a and it's again to be on the control for a as a channel

do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area and tell us worthwhile incorporating and then

try to pass and things

this is just a working design a this

about it i i try to define like what we're doing now try to find what

like design the basics i think

are there certain parts of basics and one point or less important than the basics on

basic so you know things that to start everything going but i everybody

because it ties you down to how long the device will last i'm it ties you down

like for example voice recognition right that might be constrained

right that might be constrained because that you might need a microphone a menu are

voice recognition rate on

that sense but i mean these a functioning you know the base what

the base what you have to do so

think we should maybe you wanna go back to what the functions are i think

are i think that's more relevant to discussion

you have a transmitter important but it's worth it to you know

the basic principle

with display broken down to more components right which
