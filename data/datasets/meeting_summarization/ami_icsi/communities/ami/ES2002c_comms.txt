do we need an l. c. d. display what
i'm not saying there's no need for an l. c. d. display but

and then if you have anything to kind of the you know you're gonna want to discuss maybe just make a note of that animal have all the discussion at the end i like it better ideas
so that's kind of the end result hopefully
it as for the case kind of discuss that
and i think it's all you think we haven't discussed that we need to a is a really kind
that's kind of a design thing you guys can discuss

they're actually just plastic that's textured kind
that's textured kind of a little bit like

d. x. and thinking that some of these ideas for seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people so see that them as in terms of texture shape colours things like that
or people could by the control and then it comes at different like
the shape of the control and it's

background everything i was kind of background
we think is some kind of a thing that unifies at all do we agree on
the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use but the
you can throw it kind of you know just the you know so my
we just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a thing to inspire there
is a really kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing

and feel so for the look-and-feel seem coherent and not just sort of bits and the two pieces of concept in technology or whatever or fashion then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all so you can visualise
that feel kind of
as i'm thinking maybe you should we try and think about having something like a some kind of an innovative concept about how the the volume and the channels or control "'cause" that's the main thing people

then there's the other aspect of the it back d. v. market
that's just go right back to the marketing ideas for start discussing i'd

and plastic and they have to get it from them to incorporate them into this
maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber
something a bit more flash or maybe have rubber incorporated
or maybe have rubber incorporated in the case as so

it kinda feels kind of former to touch
i know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind
and i think maybe we should try and stay away from this the big protruding rubber buttons "'cause" i'm just be so standard
you feel kind of like you get pens and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not they're actually just plastic

can we power a light in this to
thing or you could trigger that to use that the power of a light as opposed to

and they said the voice control can i talk back if you have a question so
i think like when you guys said the most input that's needed is in the user interface the rest
like you said time to market was a problem and
i'm it said it could talk to you but i never said anything about be able to this and it
like i said we have a hybrid kind of thing so it's not gonna charge the battery it's just
in a slight said away
you know you have colours and they don't need that much power i said about
i mean is not what we just said we see that had a designer

we get right in the or we completely steer away from it you need
to researcher at hanukkah need to it and maybe
and we'll have a modified or something scratch that anyway you need to
i suspect there are very fixed a particular need so
need so at and mixing them may not be a good idea
whereas with phones people charge them once a week we're gonna need to put
need to be long as we need with a square thing
or something i dunno are we need if you turn
i was saying no need for talk back at does anybody

on that maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or
"'cause" you go back to be fine different requirements or at different offerings or what component of it so
and then the different hats material so you can use
but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the things so i think that there is some
i mean i'm thinking that what we need to do is have something we can it unifies a lot of the different concepts and if we think that

and i told you guys were the three new requirements about ignoring teletext ignoring of an excel a t. v. and trying to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan
do we have a corporate colour
do we have a corporate colour scheme i dunno
mean do you want that they the corporate colours but they
the corporate colours but they don't say you know for can use any other "'cause" at all
so back to your idea but incorporating idea of like fruit and h. and the corporate colour and things like that

this one brands distant on size and so the control and the buttons
and it's rubber the buttons should be located on the control
i'm thinking research is that most controls are just this big breaks with the buttons all of them
but we are leaning quite a bit to decide it being low tech rubber buttons plastic frame is almost like a reproducing
