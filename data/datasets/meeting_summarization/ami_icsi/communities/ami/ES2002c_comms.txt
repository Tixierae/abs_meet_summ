it's it fulfil it's all
it's all the sense
that we're gonna creep are audio visual and other functions into those calories and i
i like it better ideas time and
right so "'cause" it function f.
top european fashion trends that i read about to say this is this a margin thing in the fruit and vegetables especially in clothes and
so probably a lot of a competition on the market will be still in last year's mode so if
to you i'm not very about the voice thing "'cause" i don't know the email and it was fact quite sketchy on what the voice options are i'm it
and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and depending it so then you
the user interface restrictions means that if you use more complicated features like the buttons the standard the l. c. you can on the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic the case
there's no restriction on the plastic and you cannot
it's just been quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've so but
it's more just that we think about like what it is are trying to achieve and then
collects are forced to one take it
things so as you scroll through "'cause" we say we might have a jog dial as you scroll through your stations you can you action tells you what it's
i think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get those things into that so it's
so it's a bit nuts to get you the monday tuesday wednesday you know
and the one issue we need keep in mind that then is that you're committing the user to moving it and
eventually just it's just too much of a nuisance because i dunno where all the time work
that feel kind of

a number two with that it be innovative so
i'm thinking of a mac ipod a sort of last year is because it's very
again within the back door button stand-by and
and then you can just walk through it and we'll have
and we'll have a modified or something scratch that anyway you need to
but you could have like plastic and rubber
i think plastic or rubber would be fine but plastic with rubber
you cannot be curved on the wood
so that's again i don't think you can use them in a combination especially the titanium
so you could figure that to like i said about single
like i said about single thing or you could
thing or you could trigger that to use that the power of a light as opposed to
as opposed to so when they pick it up
so when they pick it up right and then that sort of triggers that
that's just go right back to the marketing ideas for start discussing i'd
for start discussing i'd be on that i recall about fifty minutes to play with that most so
so something quite curvy
curvy
right it colourwise i
then i've had kinetic things before and the

background everything i was kind of background
it's a second
the components are exactly the same i think like
i think like when you guys said the most input that's needed is in the user interface the rest
and the parts a factor that and
the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use but the
but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the things so i think that there is some
but you know might be easier from a cost perspective in a complexity just use one you know supposed to
any the components are logic chips again i'll go back to the component chips the court how
the court how complex or how easy the logic is it depends on how many functions you have on the unit and
and that impacts cost i don't
so like what i said you probably need like a battery and something else
the choice of material "'cause"
'cause i was kinda thinking about is you know how you get this whole system mobile phones and the plastic but
maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber
and the on and then we could have curved shapes "'cause" wood
it can be quite if you start them this print your a death or black and yellow and then have to
and then have to have one is called colour for the buttons

and i told you guys were the three new requirements about ignoring teletext ignoring of an excel a t. v. and trying to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan
start with the last meeting is
you know the macrophone it
create to you and
there's a beep or a discussion about that existing ones there and plastic and
and plastic and they have to get it from them to incorporate them into this
they had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium the
thinking fruits in my head but as tacky
and the plastic but then also the rubber on the outside it kinda feels
it kinda feels kind of former to touch
no i agree with the either
this in here "'cause" of the slide about decision making which i've forgotten
it's got about five minutes
everyone of things run into my mind right now i realised
into my mind right now i realised are being a fashion to wrap meeting in have but the decisions made but we are leaning quite
but we are leaning quite a bit to decide it being low tech rubber buttons plastic frame is almost like a reproducing

it kind it is as though "'cause" when we get into the
we it decided on
decided on our target group being fifteen to thirty five
we decided that it was gonna be non rechargeable battery power that we're gonna creep are
time and so if we start off with an g. and then craig in and they have if
with this year that switch off that's why should be and how much as
from now i have i've got a preferences finally again control again
i think from marketing gimmick it's a technology thing it's a shake it
you know you have those balls you know those stress ball so you bounce the ball and it a lights up and it goes you know that might be a gimmick
we just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a thing to inspire there
is there a particular shape that you're interested in like
easy
got about five minutes and
and hate us but here
have kinetic power mean what is anybody think that

right so that was concept
small and so am i that's
am i that's more in a sense of small so in terms of comfortable not source
not source more you can't you know like a phone or some too small for
for and getting it from production point of view
the case a with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels with the taking
with the taking in case and you check that
and you just chair or you just pick it up a light up or something
like a phone like the back button for that
like a phone
whereas with phones people charge them once a week we're gonna need to put
we're gonna need to put in a really good battery city will have to charge their remote control if you do
so call that the snowman shape trademark
in there somewhere going to want the whole thing yellow in that

and word then making it's more of like more like a comfortable type of or more
and we've got an email from things to do research department and they said
and they said the voice control can i talk back if you have a question so
so if you could be good to have them and confirm a action you take
are we want slogan is something that
can ask questions
can we power a light in this to
i think we could because the l. c. d. panel requires an hour and the l. c.
i suppose that if you're when you're not using it then you're not using any power either so you'd
here chip on print it that's an industrial design thing that they that's
and this i see right suggest as be small like quite small
i know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind

on the rest what we do so that's why suggested we get an so out
innovative because the thing at the messages
so how do you make innovation makes any more easy to use that's i
large shouldn't be a little things like the the mobile phones it
at the bottom so they are lemon you know definitely fifth of whatever catering
i think these are quite standard things
the other ones are a solar powered cell which may not be a great idea
which may not be a great idea in europe or it any country that seasons "'cause" of the year you be dead so like what
hour and the l. c. d. is a form of a light so
i mean it's quite important to get yellow in there somewhere
i think the advanced ones they're the ones don't use used to be it inside and

and then so this is what with all that information what i'm suggesting in the slide here is that we take these ideas and as we get
to hold that are just one big breaks and the very it
just if you get frustrated a remote control you can throw it kind of
you can throw it kind of you know just the you know so my
my from my role i don't in a personal preferences my role preferences i think
it can't be curved
to be one of the things we just ran include is a really good battery
and it's gonna take battery power and
basic ones that have to call and they are from somewhere

so instead
so let's move on
do we have a corporate colour scheme i dunno
lot of good information that
it's a shame the cable wasn't just the middle of the table have
and there are three hundred no
the company colour yellow mean if we think
like i said we have a hybrid kind of thing so it's not gonna charge the battery it's just

not very comfortable to hold that are just
the rest of the components did you have an impact in terms of cost and complexity like you said time
in a sense of these all options available for it's
right here one is theta two display
display meeting
but how if you have a bright colour yellow lose it so much
and it when the corporate colour is yellow mean if we could think
mean if we could think about the colour of the whole problem being yellow i don't know

or something you know to me like or it's got something else to add they just scenes innovative because
you know something which is like you see a lot in other areas like i see
be a bunch of data possibly and they view the top section and make use of them as
then there's how the case actually looks it can actually be
it can actually be flat or it can be curved and then
to you have one controls but they are
i'm in a certain after i got quite a bit of those words times

something i think that would be pushing it
we think is some kind of a thing that unifies at all do we agree on
do we agree on us like a marketing
this and it said something about sensor banana curve like that so maybe
"'cause" you go back to be fine different requirements or at different offerings or what component of it so
so but i ask right

in any way soft is the material shape and function and so i
like you know just as in the simple sense when you pick up the phone and touch a button it to lights up usually the buttons light out how to me build
an extra features we add the on the b. c. one should be didn't we shouldn't be on
that's why i think the option of the kinetic thing which means as long as you shake it like a watch i can i might watch
maybe what we could do is to think about a concept which touches back to the on the the colour use the company colour yellow
maybe you could just for opening a circuit can say it to

something which is i that's a very high-tech ten gigabytes whatever but
so i think that there is some restrictions on i think you could probably
i think you could probably go plastic or rubber together wood and titanium but
i don't in the logic chip has a but size "'cause" they should be about the same size power consumption
size power consumption should be about the same
thing yellow in that yellow and white or

come on i mean it's working
strange i thought that will impact on the rest what we do so
style is number one thing in the market if we were selling to
'cause i don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing the other
anyone in trouble and

whatever but when you hold in your hand the signal buttons you know the macrophone
and we'll discuss it after
i think whatever it is used to need a battery "'cause" i don't think
and then the the materials but
and would scare me

all i have but hopefully we can revisit those ideas when we get into
like years and
you deprive
the controls and cells tend to use a very resistant colour scheme
colour scheme for instance the standby button is no threat that we should be

and she avoids things like that
yes the corporate colour scheme was it we should have a very bright colour so they can be so identified anywhere
these other options are available to you
yellow i don't know
try to draw it on the board

it's it because like the website the other and it's a bad at the bottom so
we shouldn't be on the time to be visible
time to be visible without something be opened doors and a special extra for
judge on it's a little the line a set of s. n.
is a year i can really made a point about how if you the bright colour yellow these it is that

at the messages easy to use so how do you
and the very it is lost and
easy
and i think that's a good we had were pretty basic ones that have to call

but we want to think also that the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics
it's points to increase the cost of a lot of a thought
but the question is what are we using it will work
i think that has some impact on and many things

innovative design technology is also a master that it seemed to be seen to be cutting edge but ease of use
to researcher at hanukkah need to it and maybe
and how much as any other examples of that button
and you check that i think

like count the ones that most fond of in terms of getting like it into it would be like like lemon or something like that you know something which is
stand-by and the other examples of that
you know it just if you get frustrated
colourwise i mean here it

the buttons should be large shouldn't be
do we have a corporate colour
if we do you say to go for voice activation this short be a bunch of data possibly
is something that fashion into electronics and we don't

and after a possibility
about that then with this two weeks ago are we want slogan
i could check that for you but i don't think you can
but i don't think you can actually use them in a combination

point of view the last components we use in the simpler the components means you pretty cost any increase your profit
this new one too
putting in lights is cheaper putting an l. c. d. panel just make it go with a bit of a
when you say it's an l. c. d. as in a new to be that and that's the

scared me turn on your control is this
also that work if we want to incorporate an l. c. d. display where to put that we put
to put that we put that on the inside it or
do we need an l. c. d. display what

i missed you're right i mean
so i tried to take a lot of market research and summarise it for us and then i'd identify
then you just go back and talk about some of the restrictions

we could just open up a template for
research i have here is on fashion style which
which as we've as a prairie

and then sort of brightness altogether and at the c. ceds that's it some of the overall vision
and then in terms of material trends everything's to be soft and spongy and
and it's a sales gimmick i think from marketing

and then that initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it's it helps
that's the way i interpreted in any way soft
it and maybe with my examples of them been existing remote controls

mode so if we try and re capitalise on that i think that'll be in our favour
so this is the summary of everything
time work remote controls similar you were on vacation i don't know every something and it's just tested more than so we should

how to me build on that maybe like
on that maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or
the question can ask

or people could by the control and then it comes at different like
cover or something so any does it that's
the first was sent a battery the second one i

button and for that for
and if we think that what we are what are number one marketing motive is the look and feel so
and feel so for the look-and-feel seem coherent and not just sort of bits and the two pieces of concept in technology or whatever or fashion then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all so you can visualise

the problems about that
so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing
so you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it taking aim for idea i'm in a certain after

and the law components the power the logic which has been an infrared the effect in terms of the size of the device and
need to be long as we need with a square thing
are you know like in circular and she were

on you to just go through the components
bit of those words times i thought and
i thought and so i think that's what energy is fancy here chip

plastic with rubber and what i was i'm not very
i was i'm not very about the titanium they had
so back to your idea but incorporating idea of like fruit and h. and the corporate colour and things like that

why what kind of like you want anything here
i mean i'm thinking it might be that for a this to be high-tech think it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it and it's gonna take battery
of that you got two groups there are maybe

though "'cause" when we get into the in the meeting what kind of time but action in design as opposed to background everything i
l. c. d. display but it's what what tell the user "'cause" l. c. d. it

so if we have the three presentations and then if
i was saying no need for talk back at does anybody

and then if you have anything to kind of the you know you're gonna want to discuss maybe just make a note of that animal have all the discussion at the end i like it better ideas
it's a shake it doesn't work shake it nokia or something you know

and and then sort of go through some of the way that that was that information and then sort
just being design

and then i'd identify trends that are sort of in synch an important to our project plan that we have so far and then that initiate
the second one i think it's more of a gimmick that actually usable thing it's a wind-up

so that it's it helps us to narrow way on aspect sell inform other that elements of the project that makes
that makes sense that's strange i

for a pointer right
is lost and then give a dark colours of the

and not can specify not a functional look or feel up for fancy
however this is where we can have to be very adding creative about a number two

and third very for ease of use so again that
it's probably sense of when you fill it so you could

is that i think we should think about is how the but how the innovation it can truly so the look and feel and not so much to the functionality of it for example like
furniture when i first saw that i thought what do we want to actually try and think about this trend in how we add something to it or

"'cause" i think what we're in is partly
so i think we might wanna be careful about how you how quickly we create like a remote control the shape of an apple or something i think that would be pushing

and spongy and two of my set ergonomic or from a handle which is
and you have are we all available like a scroll-wheel there's an l. c. d.

year is because it's very hard and sort of blasting in glossy so i'm thinking
of former to touch those bit more comfortable maybe we could

maybe more vibrant for anything
and as we get in the more and more i think like sort of production side of things are we think about

side of things are we think about shape materials and teens or series to go through a sort of like
us like a marketing identity

that makes sense
that's and i mean colourwise that's everything i mean it's quite important

d. x. and thinking that some of these ideas for seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people so see that them as in terms of texture shape colours things like that
i'm thinking we could incorporate some these features in a fairly in the something which is which seems to have something to which is almost gimmicky because

like i see what's web sites and things it seemed associate like lemon and mine so
because like like something to do it like the lighting within that like you know

so and it's just an idea
i'm it said it could talk to you but i never said anything about be able to this and it

this one brands distant on size and so the control and the buttons
the shape of the control and it's

and it's rubber the buttons should be located on the control
and the plato's yellow

the mobile phones it should be easy to press a comfortable
there's an l. c. d. display

have to come by the by being taken it very cute and time very easily with your lemon idea
energy what i do think that suggesting where harp are in the think i would you like the

and make use of them as long as there are some do voice a bit of a cold or
and watches

the corporate colours but they don't say you know for can use any other "'cause" at all
so so you just to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach a nasty decision on the concepts of the product so

and that would have something to impact on how i think more how you hold rather than the actual use using the remote control because
you know that might be a gimmick combine with rubber you know it

the remote control because like we say we define i really wanna basic things it to be visible on our estimate right so
so you know it's just a matter of working out space so i three

of it so your basic components of buttons and you have are we
achieve and then we have one sort of seen that we stick with you

but i could check
in this to me get a strong a battery power like

something else and the kinetic one i for me is the most interesting one because
interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and

especially the titanium i suspect
i suspect there are very fixed a particular need so

eliminate it items close
when the t. v. guys you can put the remote control

does anybody have any ideas of what how we can fiddle and together mean
mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing where

it has anybody got like an overall picture in mind about what my work
i mean i'm thinking that what we need to do is have something we can it unifies a lot of the different concepts and if we think that

'cause wood or titanium it's gonna have to be boxy in rectangular and i think we might be moving
and i think we might be moving away from that you know so

so many for an l. c. d. display
back at does anybody disagree with that

user we have the options because what does it the same thing
what does it the same thing goes for the speaker is there any of the remote control that to talk back

support for i mean just it's just
i mean just it's just worth pointing it because like i've known and people they have kinetic watches that they were all the time and it's just like magic

and it's just like magic because it's always power there's no battery
also known people have and things like a jewelry watch they were from time to time eventually just it's

it i have on in this meeting then if we

just read half of the minutes from the last meeting

meeting is there anything i've run anything

and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about right so if you wanna

scrolling

what how do you do a speech recognition only

only use the try maybe incorporate we have made a definite decision on that right

or should also point out that being a kind of the final object to this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product so

so that's kind of the end result hopefully

'cause it function f. eight

are the logo is not good

that alright so look it

so look it so this is the method that can i had wanna

i had wanna do here we get in there too far as i want to show you all the background information i have that i think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful

so out of different figures in ratings above have people in general consumers in general the number one thing that was found was that the important to television remote control a fancy look-and-feel and not

so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative with a adding just a necessary to the functional but stuart and

of use so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be and quite user-friendly you will still having technology so it all the

so it all the same right away is a bit of a foreshadowing how we perceive at us in terms of marketing is that i

for example like when you pick it up and push it like it all light up or something you know to me like

then there's the other aspect of the it back d. v. market

especially in clothes and furniture when i first

we get right in the or we completely steer away from it you need

my feeling is that we do want to observe this trend but we want to

in what we're in is partly sort of home decor partly something like a computer

from a handle which is which also you indicated that last year this was this is not the case so

but ease of use has to be insured threat that was like the number

threat that was like the number three thing and then at the end

and then at the end there or vibrate natural colours

and so i brought that rid of the bottom to get a sort of a context of discussion mac ipods something

so i'm thinking of we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a mac ipod and

sense so

so like a threat a few ideas they're just a kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon line i dunno green colours or whatever just i.

that's probably not sending

i'm thinking research is that most controls are just this big breaks with the buttons all of them

you know backtrack to look at not very comfortable

dark colours of the show replace it and say the cages you can we see them

a system to the user then identify with this year

one examples given a nonspeech was does it up and down volume button that was somehow be on them so with the up volume buttons

so with the up volume buttons they should be down volume button that can be confusing and she avoids

one topic

we should definite boards the big square block i just

and we don't have like photos kids mean

mean do you want that they the corporate colours but they

i the same thing again i start with something very basic so just so you guys

so just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process and then

like you said time to market was a problem and

and how me components are physically in cost

so i three things costs complexity and the size is

the size is the three things that we'll have an impact on you to just

options available for it's going to the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later

and then the different hats material so you can use

so you can use i don't think you can use them in a combination

i think the main impact is complexity

and the other thing is the power options

it's a wind-up mac you know a crank

i think that's more of a look and feel position because i don't think you can have one power source if you using alternative power sources

i think something comfortable to hold small

i think a sky because it has to be square

need so at and mixing them may not be a good idea

power and to make that a realistic goal i think one of the issues that will come up later is can the battery power

i thinking are you thinking of like in the sense of a light or

a light or a light in the sense of it those kind of you know frankenstein it's a lot is

i'm thinking along the lines of year you in the dark watching a d. v. d. and you find the thing in the dark can you go like the s. and r.s their

the s. and r.s their be there's always the volume button in the dark and

the people than wanna shake the movie control

type of thing where your thoughts on that

i would go for a them you know up a fruit shape the very deep sort of curvy type shape than

shape than you can see that action colours or three

so maybe do it or we think it's something that looks could sit in your hand have to be are so you call on the comfortably or

or something like i was saying also line lemon you know we can we come up with something

we can we come up with something read we tried associate with like the series we just come up with something

in like miss marketing of any research on some need to be long as

"'cause" that wouldn't help narrow down the choice of

i'm into it want it in like the shape of alignment or no i agree

so up for what it is it's your hands and then you can be another bob the top for just a function need

it's quite distinct a ship that

and also i mean how we're going to incorporate the slogan and the fact that talks

the fact that talks j. i mean it might be quite if when you first start using it says what is it putting fashion into electronics or something i dunno

or something i dunno are we need if you turn

are we need if you turn off or something if we can speak if you can actually say the slogan might be a bit more powerful than just having a red not somewhere and and it's also

i think that would be scared me turn on your

c. d. display what's the functionality of that

it will work would be achieved and putting in lights is

and that's the thing i can see it happen might be if it was somehow connected with less things so as

i'm not saying there's no need for an l. c. d. display but

i think that would make it for a complex

'cause l. c. d. it tends to be an output as a post and input so there's a remote control need to talk back to the user we have

right so you're gonna have the three different sets of functionalities

i mean to integrate the meant to say hey this room and boris them on inside is the ones that what you're thinking

what else to use so far

where would you physically position the buttons

so he's gonna pop this in here "'cause" of the

i would you like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the backup of the battery but have kinetic power mean

it as for the case kind of discuss that

is almost like a reproducing the same all the remote control that there should be think about

be think about how we are actually getting this hi-tech user-friendly right thing like

thing like what is that the where you were using to achieve those goals like

'cause i think that back lighting the buttons and like that
