and then if you have anything to kind of the you know you're gonna want to discuss maybe just make a note of that animal have all the discussion at the end i like it better ideas
and then that initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it's it helps
it as for the case kind of discuss that
and i think it's all you think we haven't discussed that we need to a is a really kind
that's kind of a design thing you guys can discuss

like you know just as in the simple sense when you pick up the phone and touch a button it to lights up usually the buttons light out how to me build
like a phone like the back button for that
'cause i think that back lighting the buttons and like that

i think whatever it is used to need a battery "'cause" i don't think
so like what i said you probably need like a battery and something else
we're gonna need to put in a really good battery city will have to charge their remote control if you do

just if you get frustrated a remote control you can throw it kind of
you can throw it kind of you know just the you know so my

of fifty channels imagine kind of
imagine kind of

background everything i was kind of background
or should also point out that being a kind of the final object to this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product so
so that's kind of the end result hopefully
we think is some kind of a thing that unifies at all do we agree on
the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use but the
we just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a thing to inspire there
is a really kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing
that's textured kind of a little bit like

can we power a light in this to
thing or you could trigger that to use that the power of a light as opposed to

to researcher at hanukkah need to it and maybe
in like miss marketing of any research on some need to be long as
need to be long as we need with a square thing

so like a threat a few ideas they're just a kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon line i dunno green colours or whatever just i.
d. x. and thinking that some of these ideas for seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people so see that them as in terms of texture shape colours things like that
so back to your idea but incorporating idea of like fruit and h. and the corporate colour and things like that
shape than you can see that action colours or three

like i said we have a hybrid kind of thing so it's not gonna charge the battery it's just
so you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it taking aim for idea i'm in a certain after

my feeling is that we do want to observe this trend but we want to
and it's rubber the buttons should be located on the control
and feel so for the look-and-feel seem coherent and not just sort of bits and the two pieces of concept in technology or whatever or fashion then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all so you can visualise
it kinda feels kind of former to touch
i know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind
that feel kind of
but we are leaning quite a bit to decide it being low tech rubber buttons plastic frame is almost like a reproducing
and i think maybe we should try and stay away from this the big protruding rubber buttons "'cause" i'm just be so standard
you feel kind of like you get pens and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not they're actually just plastic

on that maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or
or people could by the control and then it comes at different like
"'cause" you go back to be fine different requirements or at different offerings or what component of it so
and then the different hats material so you can use
but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the things so i think that there is some
i mean i'm thinking that what we need to do is have something we can it unifies a lot of the different concepts and if we think that
right so you're gonna have the three different sets of functionalities

and plastic and they have to get it from them to incorporate them into this
you know that might be a gimmick combine with rubber you know it
the case a with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels with the taking
maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber
something a bit more flash or maybe have rubber incorporated
or maybe have rubber incorporated in the case as so

this one brands distant on size and so the control and the buttons
i'm thinking research is that most controls are just this big breaks with the buttons all of them
the buttons should be large shouldn't be
large shouldn't be a little things like the the mobile phones it
of it so your basic components of buttons and you have are we
and then have to have one is called colour for the buttons
where would you physically position the buttons

and then sort of brightness altogether and at the c. ceds that's it some of the overall vision
so i think we might wanna be careful about how you how quickly we create like a remote control the shape of an apple or something i think that would be pushing
the shape of the control and it's
from now i have i've got a preferences finally again control again
the remote control because like we say we define i really wanna basic things it to be visible on our estimate right so
when the t. v. guys you can put the remote control
is almost like a reproducing the same all the remote control that there should be think about
and maybe some of brightness controls and like that but
