how they feel about to the crack remote controls would be like but you don't
so we've got the to the a survey on the use of the remote controls and i'd like to show
remote controls and the table is
but just to your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want so we've
we should only make a remote control now some more some of those it's just a remote control
so here is a remote control
market doesn't of remote control so you know it better it's very
on the t. v. but you that we talk about the universe so the remote control
speakers in the remote control

current remote controls you know they are the same as this one and they are not
and the other thing is that it do you do current remote controls are not so easy to use
and most of the buttons on the current remote controls are not used so i
'cause current remote controls so they're never easy enough to use

when you go to the so for take a control and
take a control and pointed to the t. v.
and any move out at all you move to the other car all the room and take a control
and take a control with you

of my is like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it
like if i want to put volume up or like to do might take a remote control do that sounds like

your phone that you can phone your remote control but why not

and because of the fact that there's so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody
remote controls that nobody use in fact

remote control and as we can see it really does a d. h. young people
it's annoying briefly describe the working design for remote control
think of all these young people who would love to say that this remote control on you work for them and how you cannot

in a want to tell you about what people are the wall and like in disliking remote controls and then
what i suggest is that instead of deciding also for what could be and what should be a good the remote control that's ask people who are users of remote controls how they
what we found was that so all things that the user bolts i can remote controls
is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for it and look good fancy looking remote control so
not so easy to use and it did the current the first lady's that the for do not match what people really want to use their remote controls
people are very frustrated with their remote controls
it is maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please where are you like to have
them so most of the people say they be don't know how to do to use properly their remote controls
and i think in one their remote control i've seen instead of doing that you could just say these are the chance to channel three twenty eight forty eight and the sixty four of those that i want to be cycle with my next button

so now it really depends on the kind of targeting the what who are we targeting with these remote control i think he for targeting
since we're targeting a really use some the date for d. v. d. and e. stream of this remote control i think we will only
and how you cannot use my remote control because it's targeted
should we target a user personalised a remote control so in

so in a given room there might be more than one remote control we would

i think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with the left right up down and cover
controls or we can have more functions for t. v.
better days so was like here we have our main chip which controls
i think automatic on off control it's not possible
control and it answers

so functions that made be use but you do use or in the current available remote controls and
one of the thing that ran the that there you are pretty aware of is the possibility d. is that a possibility of having speech recognition in a remote control so you wouldn't have
so we've got it in the survey about the weather people would like are not to have this kind of of function meeting their remote control and as
as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some it's pretty the device like t. v. or v. c. r. or d. v. d. player et cetera so we have

control so you wouldn't have to that type in your buttons but just
i would say the simplest one as long as they are the i find the buttons are they need to give it a menu button
buttons all the other things can be controlled through the screen
and all those buttons should be easy to find them too quick because
because when you watch a movie and you want to change something you always try to find a good button and click it but
maybe we can make it different modes for each button and you can
that's all i think this is not so the function easy it is being could be instead off using the buttons it's on top
main chip which controls or volume and these buttons and this t. s. b.'s again

we need the to know what the user it needs that's wonderful
will need only a few buttons all
sort to do these functions we need an improvised it's
so we need a since
so we need to have particular encryption court
that's to do more than you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch all fine
but it's a good feature i we need to
we need to think about more or to incorporate

and then as a feature that i would like to implement is a wall in control suppose
control suppose you said that you set up some volume and any move out
the user we just be able to say he's can you but but the volume or
the volume or a tree be something like volume up down and
and volume control
