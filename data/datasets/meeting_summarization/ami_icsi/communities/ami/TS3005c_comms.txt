but that's easy to do with the colour i think
it's easy to do with the colours i think

to the size or was it two colours different
it two colours different colours we should decide where
remote and different colours
we have different colours
that's a different colours is
you get different colours but you

and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts and just as
because it when use a remote control a lot of people we'll i dropped remote control on a break it because
for a remote control
so you can put be the remote control in amount station so that's charges
then you'd is the shape of the remote control
will recognise does the remote control was
but if you make the l. c. d. screen as large as the remote control itself yelling you always gets on you
but the remote control has no way or in the settings menu or just you just wanted to know the volume
fancy coloured remote control

he was a standard colour
or for that if they're standard colour
if they're standard colour
different colours but you should have a standard colour

the remote take a yellow remote where are you are not there but that calls or something and perfect
and the l. c. d. somewhere in a remote that shouldn't
a remote that shouldn't be given more curvy the remote that's
that was one remote and different
for the screen i don't know how much the actual remote should be that's the
you get some some of those and wireless mice has to be remotes
to miss possible to the g. you just put in a row underneath it on the bottom of the remote
so it makes more sense because of the remotes don't have that

it's a options is the settings of the remote enough to t. v. and that kind of a thing called cults settings
and all the people but also don't really want to use this this kind of option news so they want to
because we decided to have to kind of remotes to the size or

i think it's a it's easier to do in colour than a shape "'cause" otherwise
'cause otherwise have the can't get different shapes and colours is
and colours is what you said shapes
colour for the new shapes their

so if you scratch it's still the same colour perhaps it's
a bright colour physical forward
is a bit like a banana and the colour
i'd taller all the colours that i can maybe
colour how many colours are going to use
just a regular a remote colour and then have
they are sort of like our main colours i think we
have still for black and between those two is like i don't know it's five colours between them so they
course the fruity colours and a two colours like reading brown light out dark red and brown

it because it is the unique the idea of a remote the speech control

and what kind of material should we used to to make one of those from remote controls
first of all i have that's the structure some of the components is that are used a from what other remote controls form
i also think the can't help but notice there's you know used you have a remote control would have any l.

we determine that there will not be no but that's but only an l. c. d. screen so
l. c. d. screen so why have to look on that and the
it's right to the b. l. c. d. screen it right and you can draw from i thought
if we get like l. c. d. screen it's quite innovative so that should be
i think that's a good size for the screen i
how does that work with the l. c. d. screen
d. screen i think they don't need that big of c. p. u.
you could put it on a table what l. c. d. screen you would have
on the screen if you make screen for called as matter to

the chip on print i think what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got that it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button when

the most important thing people like to last year was that the remote control should be look fancy
look like it's a big so it's it's really an important function of the remote

i called like what's the trends from past years what colour shapes material they want that from elderly and young people so
and then i personally thought of front side of the shape should be something forty don't like that like
be any don't know which shape you should take it
but that's also how all the remotes are shape so that's
so we should for decide about shape i think with the
shapes their materials

you could to change the colours that was also be any don't know
i changing colours will be easier than changing
