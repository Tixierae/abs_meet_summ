i'll be your project manager for today for this project my name is mark not
felt i will be a year and just put a project the marketing expert and i will see
day so it was what happens inside the operators segments what is
segments what is the parade is made of that
that's right but if we always fit in your home so i mean we need
so i mean we need to be very it pre open to what's currently hoc in the market so unless
the market so unless we do need to do to bring is in blazing follow what people want
people want so we put the fashion electronics
you i'll take this project in three steps be fair three phases design first i will be the functional
so you just put on the board
erase whatever you want
i suppose check this
so draws your favourite animal
succeed elephant
it's a be ready
and it was making comments on my dolphin
in the market has to be get excellent
excellent hard to the next
suppress next
try these are tried
as exactly what wanted never kills an animal and just for the killing so
for the killing so it's very efficient and tries
really strong to them if the smiley face
i that six
that six part of the it's put in here whatever

i'm more into the technical aspects of drawing so
aspects of drawing so i'm not really good at drawing animals but
draws a technical animal
at the rich like a dolphin because if it's
don't want the high response of products
looks more like a nuclear bomb
but does it look like a nuclear bomb the thing isn't doing
me she technically she first
next three i like the

and a meeting afterwards we can share information that
so i'm gonna give a short see that a
and everything so the help of these we have the smart boards here use
here use the regular powerpoint presentation and
and sebastien introduction on this doing board so which
check this out
it's a beautiful animal
with a smile on it's very important

it's like eraser erase
and so it will be easy to use to us age of use it you wanna change the format
it you wanna change the format you just they take out this is like the pen and whatever you want current colour the line white just to make the line bigger
so is really easy is take the
is take the just take
that's my animal be like king size at the rich
she's a big

made of that switch it's look like
syntax it's
the i'd like to draw as a tiger
you picked a hard one didn't use
mine drawing skills are really that so
experience with that idea

so let's do that first i mean
that first i mean that's our
your marketing expert
i think the creative genius should go first

but my name is there are men felt
and i will see what the user wants and
wants and what we can do with the new product project product
next one in your are in

actually is very easy like
ideas we have a blank sheet just try
just try whatever you want and
i will be to dolphin free

of course we need to each other survive
enough there we go so a new product
three i like the elephant it's big strong

of thing will be it's very clear very
a put the minutes of every meeting i'll put them there too so everybody can
bit of responses though i prefer

but of the animal which i. p. lynch out
solar is it
space next that's it

and always goes for security in seeking a high spots and then do everything security speech
security speech and efficiency is important i think
i suppose to draw the animal next

need shoes so
just to lose to draw all black so
that's a course and ever

will be giving this presentation you to take the project off that's my this agenda
like you see here i'll just take that you two are with you so you just

that's my this agenda for today of course we need
is about unique design a remote control for television set so which has to be original

any controller user interface
user interface designer are

so which has to be original trendy and user-friendly had to this arbour
had to this arbour corporate website it's i think that

it's i think that sums of what we need to do
where's by the latest fashion only electronics but also the latest trends in clothes an interior designer that's right

so we put the fashion electronics so
so as we need to go for you

do everybody has an easy way to work and a meeting afterwards
a short see that a technical problem so

easy like it says very simple you just take out the pen
just take out the pen

it's very clear very i suppose
then use that later anyway

then use that later anyway just
the that you wanna share is put in the project folder like a put my presentation

so everybody can read up if i have to leave early or whatever so
x. men here

bomb the thing isn't doing wanna i want
it it does look like and you know

dolphin but then again this is only for me
suppose we'd all fine you like the freemen

fine you like the freemen it there represents
like the ocean like swelling do that in my

do that in my spare time so that's
i think there's a know because it's very fast it is

our marketing expert that shows an animal
an animal i

hardly ever ways as any resources
it comes to pray that it doesn't

to each other survive get acquainted first so let's do

which you can you introduce yourself your marketing

in your are in user interface

designer are going to look at the technical design from the the user point of view

my name is so you can see i'm the industrial

can see i'm the industrial designer and

designer and there are three main questions that i have to finance a two day so

i should look like

enough

so a new product is about unique

first i will be the functional design and this

and this what we're gonna do everybody has an

technical problem so skip for this

every meeting we

every meeting we everybody can present their and their views and everything so

on the board c. penney or go here it's

go here it's like using a pen you can just

you can just draw whatever you want

just take a new slide and back again

and back again i'm just gonna keep using this pour all the time of thing will be

like a put my presentation now a put the

right i mean if the electronic whiteboard a shot so basic

and then it says try your favourite animal

because if it's it's freedom i see

actually work but it's like

but it's like a very a high tech bit of responses

i prefer pen and paper

so he noticed all from

let's go easy on it

i'll just finish up real server with them

is a really look like a dolphin but then

spare time so that's and

like our marketing

now we can forget this ever happened

i like the elephant

i'm playing next

it's big strong so

it's not really that responsive know

i have to press a pretty hard

so i suggest you make as the elephant in the market the biggest wrong player in the market has

they are really bad when drawing skills

looks smooth

it is knows exactly what it wants us hardly ever ways

it comes to pray

that it doesn't always in a very thoughts way and

and as exactly what wanted never

and tries to do everything as fast as possible and

i introduced to the world of the amazing and

a hard worker

are really small the together really strong to

you've done this before have it you
