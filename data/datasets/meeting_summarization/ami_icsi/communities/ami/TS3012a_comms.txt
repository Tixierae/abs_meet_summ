so is really easy is take the
is take the just take
just take a new slide and back again
just i think it's very "'cause" i knew what we drew i like you take
like you take just take your freedom and use a trendy interface should design for us
this was to make it different from for other people have an o. just make those take a way

so draws your favourite animal
i'm more into the technical aspects of drawing so
aspects of drawing so i'm not really good at drawing animals but
draws a technical animal
i suppose to draw the animal next
add and perhaps and usability aspect t. v. is becoming

gomorrah is the first see meeting i'll be your project
to each other survive get acquainted first so let's do
you i'll take this project in three steps be fair three phases design first i will be the functional
first i will be the functional design and this
i think the creative genius should go first
me she technically she first
for you guys think about the first ideas is very short
first ideas is very short start with

wants and what we can do with the new product project product
enough there we go so a new product
so a new product is about unique
don't want the high response of products
you would but your first ideas new product but
we might have to consider other design aspects of our product so

that's my this agenda for today of course we need
of course we need to each other survive
it's i think that sums of what we need to do
that's right but if we always fit in your home so i mean we need
need shoes so
other thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with no
i think we need to cut the meeting shorts you
the personal coach will give you the your personal assignments everything so we just need back in thirty

which you can you introduce yourself your marketing
your marketing expert
felt i will be a year and just put a project the marketing expert and i will see
our marketing expert that shows an animal
so i suggest you make as the elephant in the market the biggest wrong player in the market has
i introduced to the world of the amazing and
this is a you're a thing you came up with about marketing transfer whatever

i'll be your project manager for today for this project my name is mark not
will be giving this presentation you to take the project off that's my this agenda
the that you wanna share is put in the project folder like a put my presentation

made of that switch it's look like
but it's like a very a high tech bit of responses
bit of responses though i prefer
is a really look like a dolphin but then
looks smooth
my thinking i'm not what you would you came up with you have anything to share a as a look at the meeting
a as a look at the meeting just have a shortage responses
shortage responses up

do everybody has an easy way to work and a meeting afterwards
and a meeting afterwards we can share information that
every meeting we everybody can present their and their views and everything so
a put the minutes of every meeting i'll put them there too so everybody can
so everybody can read up if i have to leave early or whatever so
they yes it would be to start the meeting it's
warning finish meeting now
cut the meeting shorts you have anything wanna share quickly
so we just need back in thirty minutes a we have

and i will see what the user wants and
in your are in user interface
any controller user interface
user interface designer are
designer are going to look at the technical design from the the user point of view
so which has to be original trendy and user-friendly had to this arbour

a short see that a technical problem so
technical problem so skip for this

so i mean we need to be very it pre open to what's currently hoc in the market so unless
the market so unless we do need to do to bring is in blazing follow what people want

the i'd like to draw as a tiger
just to lose to draw all black so
i love to draw i it's my hobby anyway

mine drawing skills are really that so
they are really bad when drawing skills
