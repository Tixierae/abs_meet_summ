new to me i don't know where you work with them before
work i've read it from my from college it should work with some kind of toolbar it didn't
toolbar it didn't find out yet i would work but
to draw on it and then it should be smart somewhere you hate i
hate i not really how this works but
nope still works so
this this tool seen it works if that's continue
you will we working on technical function design so

and to discuss the functional design and the
and the same holes for the it's too faces offer this the conceptual design and off let's have a more detailed design in
this is what you would the design a my marketing
i just be for studying detailed discussion maybe we you have the marketing
items the industrial designer
but we carry design to sum it hasn't been amended

what should be in what so what our new product should look like and
when you design a new product you off by of course want it to be original be
want so they know they will buy a product
also an important role is the product the production cost be maximal twelve euro fifty cents
so when we have a good product we are we could to me case this aim i think
so it is a new web page but but at face to face
that there's you know you use the other therefore they customers your product to them you know
maybe what we want to design a new one

plan and all know what i hope whole it's about idea new remote control we're going to design
this is about the in new remote control
the remote control
and now just let's have some discussion about what is a good remote control and
maybe someone can mention some additional a prerequisites for a tooth remote control
it should have p. d. d. expected functionality all the remote control
it an old form remote controls that you can go channel up or down in instead of retyping the number especially when you have a lot channels
as but the main controls a t. v. guide or a piece of a easy to use
so twenty five euro you expect a quite as normal but good functioning user-friendly remote control

we went designing a product i also look at you i'll keep in mind people up
more interesting for our company course but profit aim about fifty million euro so
and keep in mind is this first points to have to be original to have
l. o. you were you have to work on a designed to keep in general
minutes in your mind

welcome at at the kick-off meeting for based project i hope you will
she was our roles are in this project
then we will come to be ugly to actual project plan and all
in which the final project should get it's different shape
yes this says in some contribution to our project so
our project fine as i think when we are

the general outline of the you project will be we first go through a functional design phase
alright but first we will do some tool training
why don't you draw your favourite animal on the whiteboard
right they are animal first of
first of all time
which animal has not been drawn
one of draw animals in the water
to specify first face of project so
first before designing the for the wireless think you

the browse function as an answer
all those things tomorrow you might have a some more functions which right
you know so you should i think is over with a special what functionality
but ninety percent of the time ninety nine percent of the time you'll be using the main functions the volume the different channels so

in all in front of you you see they're no it looks and will but not blocks and we have
the different channels so i didn't have a look fancy things
didn't have a look fancy things as but the main

and then offer some twenty five minutes i hope
when we are and when you are going to design where we must keep in mind gets be selling price of the product will be about twenty five euros we
what to get a feeling this is a twenty five euro project programme
and keep in mind you to use it at twenty five euro unit so
unit so it does very fancy we can leave it out i think so twenty

but then it it also should work user friendly and
be original to have to be trendy have to be user-friendly
and you line you user interface and design they just wanted
for the wireless think you know what the functionalities that we need to know what are the user requirements and then

and then we will meet again and to discuss
especially should next
should next what we should take like that
my isn't happy to meet you
happy to meet you again
yes but about about the spec the buttons that will be on it i think we can discuss that in a in next meeting
this wrap up and go to the end of this meeting
just for the next meeting now
so next meeting will be in in thirty minutes in

i will try to get my presentation right
so we will try to structure this the meeting with an with an agenda has presented here
now we will try out the whiteboard we've here
so we if you try to just to draw on it and
you know the data from my drawing better
but you the main use it draws and

for so i don't know if we need to spend time on that actually
set so you need to a colour
you need to a colour cannot do you need
do you need to dolls the close it channels enough for government great
and you'd need the usual ones like the training the one you could mean there channel and
and then you they need internet then would be able to propose something with a t. v. although i p. but before
no it's i had this tax so you need some number
so you need some number in but that's teletext things and

to get at the international market so will
i think what when we're working on the international market in principle of have an of customers
we you have the marketing guy
so it marketing and you line you
