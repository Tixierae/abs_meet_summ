amazing it's weird
and we can clip it to know
so i think good morning everyone
welcome at at the kick-off meeting for based project i hope you will
i hope you will been a date about it
so we will try to structure this the meeting with an with an agenda has presented here
after the opening we will get acquainted to each other she was our
she was our roles are in this project
we have been provided but some technical tools to to communicate and to we learn from each other's plants
plants i can say
we'll also price to get acquainted to least tools so
there are also new to me i
then we will come to be ugly to actual project plan and all
what should be in what so what our new product should look like and
and then offer some twenty five minutes i hope
when you design a new product you off by of course want it to be original be
put to be trendy and trendy is what people
and trendy is what people want so they know
toolbar it didn't find out yet i would work but
i would work but maybe one of you did so
the documents in the shared folder
yes we will then find out what how it works
this seems to me us some computer program but i didn't find
that would be a real
right they are animal first of
we will try to get a with this
better and
i think it's fine and that don't want
and this will have no it really the wireless
it really the wireless
no especially
so the cats any cats
but we did you are work out course
any cats load up
you can still a text template it's not top
got characteristics of a toddler trendly and and fun
this is what you would the design a my marketing
my marketing
i suppose
you got a lot of rain you probably
rain you probably rich
very big rats or a small cat
yes this says in some contribution to our project so
maybe it would help us
i got an eight
no it's a swordfish
you have some in the industrial alright
for so i don't know if we need to spend time on that actually
this this tool seen it works if that's continue
if that's continue to the real
when we are and when you are going to design where we must keep in mind gets be selling price of the product will be about twenty five euros we
what to get a feeling this is a twenty five euro project programme
the remote control
for our product
more interesting for our company course but profit aim about fifty million euro so
we have to sell quite a lot of this things
we will try to
to get at the international market so will
or a certain amount or maybe
to say like this will really in the middle so

we we for an a few minutes
you all get certain task in these in his face and
and then we will meet again and to discuss

and press a
why don't you draw your favourite animal on the whiteboard
i it's cat

plan and all know what i hope whole it's about idea new remote control we're going to design
it's only gets a dog
they like to sleep that's where you said you know there are like this

then we will discuss
that's that leak that
i mean it is they like to sleep that's

want so they know they will buy a product
but then it it also should work user friendly and
and all the lights people it will not be be rated very in consumer article like that

in all in front of you you see they're no it looks and will but not blocks and we have
not blocks and we have here a he a white board
and it should work i've

so now we will try out
it shows
so we if you try to just to draw on it and

the we want to be distinguished people
people a want to that one a look at the shelf or to think that's the product that i need to put to be trendy

and the same holes for the it's too faces offer this the conceptual design and off let's have a more detailed design in
you know the data from my drawing better

but i didn't find it yet
we'll come to that later

you can zap to you know
i think for us is just like a normal whiteboard but are we recording

that plus side
like a cat

should next what we should take like that
and that's all about circuit

and you have to have just an aunt

uses order

you read the them like you know

that's that i've done my anyway

i think it should work on this

i will try to get my presentation right

finance

no matter

on a fine

but don't appear on the screen

it's weird

new to me i don't know where you work with them before

this is about the in new remote control

the general outline of the you project will be we first go through a functional design phase

and to discuss the functional design and the

in which the final project should get it's different shape

alright but first we will do some tool training

work i've read it from my from college it should work with some kind of toolbar it didn't

that i. e. and not for little bit about this shared folder

i we'd have a shared folder with the commands that can share

can share and

now we will try out the whiteboard we've here

i would suggest

to draw on it and then it should be smart somewhere you hate i

hate i not really how this works but

but are we recording what we are done

the court so that sense so

that sense so that it is going to record

that it is going to record this troops you're right

but for us it's just like a little while board

and maybe maybe you can start and

start and you can maybe find out discourse right

why don't you draw

first of all time

i live

i live a better or

especially should next

gets a dog yes

so those are that's also kind of cats isn't it

although not doesn't have a pain

it's curved tile

but the others

it's not top of that

it's the costs

a blue and black separate

can you can meet again after i think it's

very we're blue separates yes

all of that's going to get rid of my

i hope you have some space in the air a beep or for you

not a good dog

it's looks like it gets was been driven over

and we should send up it's so it carries characteristics right

it's quite relaxed situation yes

he has a small legs

thank you my dear i think

which animal has not been drawn

so you fold wrong land that also one of

one of draw animals in the water

pretty close

with different pen widths

is it a shot to me that

nope still works so

our project fine as i think when we are

we went designing a product i also look at you i'll keep in mind people up

yes more interesting for

that will do you think maybe you're up and and our our care

maybe some asian countries

also an important role is the product the production cost be maximal twelve euro fifty cents

so it's a false the selling price if i am good in mathematics

i mean we still have to to make a process

you all have to be paid
