t. v. remote controller where you and then
what i support roles is that you know a remote control you it could be a cube you say
and also this other frustrations with the president remote controls most of
we should have an l. c. d. on the room remote control
it should be the same a new ideas all that type or remote control they just
and it's always good to have and was a good mission for the remote controls
and i think it's a case is the course of the remote control you as an l. c. d.
and that our problem was to find the remote control of all this
for the channels and you can say to your remote control like sports and then

and the saying that currently in the market be i the control they a remote control those for customisable for different people so that's the point
any can call a remote control if you don't know where it is i t. v. remote controller

here because if they have few buttons you don't have a look at the at your control anymore because you
and then you don't even have a look at the button at the controller so finally

so i can use a button the mouse mean
so the class the buttons to get the
get too many buttons
said and we should have just a button like an i. d. c. r.
to have a help button
and maybe you can just change the the buttons if it should
button was that that's right and to use the scrolling "'s" or help button
it doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or for the
anymore because you know where the buttons are so

and then there you can use that as buttons you can use the israel

for interface i think that we can add that she's all the design of functionalities by is just using the rubber buttons simpler buttons and
what's the function of this button

if it should time ones that you get one buttons you can get the side you
you can get the side you get the buttons so for maybe

it somehow and the shape of the of the remote you will have
but where but just by moving or your arm the whether the remote will accumulate energy that
all remotes and how we could be a special from the other remotes and
so if you have an l. c. d. in the remote you just have a minimum and

and some people propose a scroll button integrate that with push buttons story
buttons story you may have scroll buttons that are just the push button like
pushbuttons scroll buttons spinning wheel's can be used as an indication tools and use the customisable
c. d. screen so that's you push the button and
and also the scroll button how much will it cost
the scroll button and you know from this are really
you know from this are really know see that people would like to have some scrolling button was
and then just just push it keeps button so it's automatically

by the time the phone the remote control the program is finished so
and if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it

and the commands and mechanisms the user uses to control its operation and it would be that so you see
and you just as a remote that and cat which could be used for kids and if
be used for kids and if a remote that

so we just met and marketing so we're all for people need from all remotes and
fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room aren't people are always
fifty percent people that responded that they always lose the remote some
lose the remote some part for both and they say that it's quite difficult to law and if it's too complex so
i'm in as those of us as the people are willing to pay more if your remote store fancy so if you have a
or it could be like this as the people say they have a l. c. d. on the remote not on the television because when you have
of all this sort of people than other people say they lose the remotes so

or maybe we can include the user money in be and the remote control it said and
so centre percent of the users the find the remote controls very ugly they don't find it rather than
and the cat and remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user

so you still using the buttons you have the l. c. d. screen and then
that we can load can do is you can programme function we're back when you press the switch off t. v. but then off button in the remote that these things are some screen plays trash charging me you never get it does because
i think there's another where you can do is that you can we should when the user to press the button to choose the channel for example then what you can do is that the you can make the t. v. screen to split them into small it only those square ease of images where you have a central on every channel so let's

we also we also can put regular battery in the remote control no
above and i meant by battery and i would not have a why are between the remote control and an energy source but
we didn't decide that which kind of battery we gonna put inside the the remote so
as always boring to change the batteries of the remote control so
if there is there there is no it's not enough battery also and and the remote to the last
