so we can still operate the all the things because you don't always
gonna look we have
would we change the
we change that the order or are we going
she hope for front out how to do is with that we're document
important but if i can get and then we need a
so you have to think of it as that the remote control is that sort of technology you know for this
and then we have to agree on the rating together
in india to kind enough wish of all waiting to see this on each
or false i'll i'll give it it a two
i use my feet
personally i do not fair remote control those footing yellow so
yellow so i would give this a five

getting that i have a integration that would work so it will
so it i think it would give it it a four
it's taken with i disagree with because we really in at the young market and i think
next six
yes the small room
so but it can it get lost if it's such a thing i
it reality is that i think with the way
i think with the way it looks and these designs i would give it a two
that's a fancy look and feel
rough very fancy it trendy

doesn't look like that
it must be a fashion
no that's new innovation
maybe you look at the latest trends for the younger people and they have to afford and vegetable so it has
vegetable so it has a a colour more prepared food that we didn't
would go for luxury
back to mine
which was the last three or

it's a it's yellow and
we have seven point scale form tool as to false seven and
so now i think you see it one it's statement your taste true
your taste true or false and two ways one
yellow all look like
right would work

that need the company a logo
so i'm gonna look we have
yes that was a one of the most important things that trendwatch said i didn't
said i didn't say to my presentation but
the sense that
so no we have a project very happy

no i should two person take the prototype one of your
one of your need to
and that you don't have all the buttons over try would give
try would give this a two
it's a bit personal if it's fancy so i think two

the base you mean
yes the prototype
me too would too because only the battery is not taking that technological these high standard but the rest of
one battery electronics
it's the most advanced chip on

we're getting to be expert
you all get lost so
one next
i'd go for two because the shapes are still round but
the colours are basic like yellow read the blue something

feel soft it
it looks like a little bit of a bit like a joystick it's a
and then the last one i could think of it
so i would that not a gift is a one or two i
so it's a two and three nine to one for that

so now last time can
can you pushed that is one time
one time please so
i say fruit so

based on our marketing strategy on at the latest trends or user fee for answers
and based fees quick area we need to give waiting we can
i think the scroll button or something also new
so it must be a fashion i think five

we put fashion in electronics
i get this one because of the rubber feel soft
food that we didn't
three or treating

the next statement it's not too much buttons
buttons i have to
but the latest trends are soft things like
blue something what also younger people want it's also try and

and the buttons
so counting there is two and a half
next please so no

is volume up the left is volume down
sort of joystick and l. c. d.
i mean it still has large buttons and not many buttons so

so i mean the colours are for young people but
it will be fiction
i think five

so i think two is better
we do not paying any afford to face you all this or something like that so i would that not a gift
no close your slide show

that thing and special colour
yellow
interface push button

we we had some we have a new idea
and then it covers the these buttons

beta
not a lot of remote controls have i think

maybe for seen a three point so it's a like a mobile just
like i'd give it a four

i think if we do this it's it's really orient it on the design so i'll give
it will be fiction

i have to sets is not week as a low number is better in the
like send in my presentation

and as of range not have too much buttons so
if we go to it's fashion a still of course to a lot of buttons for the numbers

it have to and now we have to calculate an average rating we
twenty one so it's a

i'm still the secretary

and this is rubber

the sides and the rest is hard plastic

and the rest is hard plastic

we have a new idea that this can be doing the side and then

till he or something and then you

or something and then you can still use the power button and the mute and the joystick

because you don't always use the menu

and then we can break

and everything if you accept the power button and the nudes

and the nudes of

newt and the other buttons

channel i hear it but

and the joystick as for the volume and the channels

very often

a page channel up and down channel down

and down channel down to the right

to the right is volume up the

that's on the were the part

so what they say on the side it's put fashion in their yes

so that's it's prototype know

know the findings

or are we going to if rather teachers

findings is yes

first

yes we have to evaluate the project yes

we go and do the information now will be getting that i have

i have i think a few inflation do we have based

so we can do we can hear it they said she hope

we have to word document

so we open a that blank

this is an example so that's not very important but

to see this on each item

i think it's technology thing it's not it doesn't contain many new features or it

i think technologically i'll give it seven six

seven six

six six

a true or false i'll

it's a one there's item

'kay the second item this

this product is for all sorts of customers

and i think to a that's a good talking yellow it's not really in for all customers doesn't look

that's a six

yes it's for the you work group that's

that's a half the half of the people

so i think it's four

that's the model for our company

do we do this with this product

but the rest of it is so i think a two

i say a five it's not fashion

it's not fashion is new

yes it would if it's not a fashion

the make it a three

yes of things that to i agree

three is

i use my feet up

we'll outside

the next element use the product looks good personally i

two or three two

in the end it calculates never was

so that's why it's an active in it

it does not get lost easily

did we implement that the sound

yes the small

all look like a pistol

yes it's not not a normal shapes so

it won't get between the pillow so on the couch

we aim for the younger market

of it goes with the latest trends

it's also try and so i give it to

three

me too free

so and come back to the presentation now so we find

effort is to ten don't see twenty

so that's a pretty low waiting i think

so going to r. or only for raising we did a good job

would work yes

finance

very happy to

to have it's cheap enough

so i have a for look

we have a battery one

electronics advanced chip

that's the most false

we have simple regular advanced

messed up for that files case uncurved

case uncurved flat no

single curved or double curved you have

curved you have double curved

then we had plastic wood rubber with the of

with the of how we're a hard plastic

not that thing and special
