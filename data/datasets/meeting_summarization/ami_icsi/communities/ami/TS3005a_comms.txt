i have prepared a little presentation
is my and problem and i hope you will introduce of in a few minutes as
i will tell you for on what's actually is the project is
is the agenda for our first meeting this
a little tool training with these two fangs take a look at
and around room especially here for if it's quite an decision
for if it's quite an decision that by a it's a set
it's a set of microphones and there
they won't hurt you
you i said
i said i'm the project manager and i'm hoping
and my function is user interface design i think so
a machine of our
an industrial designer and
for instance they are blue one and
but then again you do still have a lot of buttons so
but it's a i stay as
i stay as possibility to to put those buttons behind some other kind of protection so they see
just although what they're gonna
what they're gonna do that a remote phone
use every day but usual buttons as such as zapping their own that's and the volume control only the only possible buttons to use directly or

it could be a turtle or a snail and
snail
have and those are slow
it carries everything and i hope
and i hope i can also reach a lot of what this project so
that's my favourite animal
good job right the words
uh-oh
or in person but
you very much i can see we have some drawing sounds in this group that
and were hoping for a aim of fifty million euros and
and we open to achieve that's by aiming for an international market and a production
of road some examples here of what we can speak about
should be in all segments
what's your experience with remote control
of buttons which you don't use religion
black all black
the different remote controls for different devices yes
or in the numbers of course but
play pause stop

these idiots
a few minutes as i
this is the opening and what gets
and what gets hopefully we'll get acquainted to each other a little tool training
take a look at the project plan
they will be time for discussion actually
i also hope we have a presence or can we do it with each other
you can write things and of course you can also when you click here that erase things so we have
but you shouldn't believe and buy a page just create
and change the line width a fire
to know each other because i'm asking three things for that drawing do it on a blank
it's weird
and our final drawing
religion cracks
not user-friendly
last batteries and
batteries and pour signal
different remote controls
but you can integrate them or something

of microphones and there are microphones here also be said
and there are available on both smartboards but i think
smartboards but i think will mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder as you can see this is same
as you can see this is same tool bar as located here
the most functions we will use will be to add a new page
to go back and forth between pages and of course
like this everything is but present
but present put on that and you see and you could do
and you can also do you don't buy a page would be asking not
you can try at the eraser now
maybe for which market segments it should be a more should be in all segments
what actually i'd like to handle work to the back to you
a lot of buttons they always lose
search for the buttons which one is which and the
no black all

i don't know for the group will not be so would we will
would we will work to a good result and
a good result and do it as fast as we can
time for another animal would you like to go
good job right the words maybe it
and strong a dolphin because this intelligence one and
animals in our world
i have to have eraser
eraser
and a production cost will we have twelve euro fifty max

as you probably have noticed there are a little black fields on the table we have to put your
we have to put your laptop exactly in that field so
that field so that no cameras can see your face there are cameras
we have some expertise from different pieces of the company that's good
of the company that's good

so i also hope
right application you can
you can erase with the eraser but you shouldn't
and tried to draw
the total have and

as said we're working on projects and the aim
do it on a blank sheet with different
i'm not a very good at drawing but i will
animals as words sounds good
the colours

and this is the pen with it you can draw all the board for instance
save this characteristic can be just a one word i'm
would you like to go next
to make it a little bit easier
or more words

on projects and the aim for the project is to create a to design a new remote control which the
which the has to be original trendy and of course user friendly and
and i hope we have expertise to create such a project just a product

smart boards as you can see you can give a presentation on them and
and there's only a is a white boards and i will
and i will research you about that soon

good morning
and of course it to save it every now and then and

let's start with the ladies
and it also let's see i think it's here change the colour of your pen for instance they

it's consist of three phases name be the functional design conceptual design and detailed design as
design as you can see all these faces consists of two parts namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss

we will us take it sounds of these two things they are
as you can see you have to move it a little bit slow it's not such a

things they are smart boards as
project folder and every document you put in this folder is possible to show that here in a meeting room

and that's what you only for our first excise because
because i'm going to ask you to draw your favourite animal

or times four
easy to do that too but it's it's a giraffe if that

that's an idea favourite animal
it's time of are some discussion of

when we should try to make it fun
they're use batteries last

good morning everyone

i'd say like to welcome you to our first meeting

i'm the project manager of this project and

and i will tell

for discussion actually we have to discuss because

we have to discuss because we have to create a product and then

and then we will close this session

but first of all we're i'd like to in to lose room

there are cameras

be said don't be afraid of them

and i'm hoping for a good projects and

and i'd like to hear where you are on what your functions are on this project let's

i'm right in kitty and my function

of our an industrial

designer and i have to look for to very using and this project

my name's the anymore i'm the marketing expert my job for

my job for the company to promote company of more products to the customers so

and the way we hope to achieve that is through the following that it's consist of three

where we will discuss are work so far

but first i will

but first i will tell you something about the tools we have here only

have here only told about the cameras microphones but

microphones but they are not of much used to us

soon as you also noticed this presentation document is in our project folder and every

and then you can write things like test or whatever you want as you can see you have to move

it's not such a farce board it's a smartboard but

it's a smartboard but also a slow board but

but you can write things and

so we have test left and

page would be asking not to do that just

to do that just simply create a new one and start

and start all over because we want to save

because we want to save all the results

does everyone understands this

so you can erase anything

just create a new blank one i will do it as

but you can of course do is when you make a mistake but don't

but don't delete and five pages and it also

it's all the biggest to know each other because

colours i just showed you how to pick a card and also with different

and also with different pen widths which i also

which i also showed you

but i will go first

or maybe you should what i'm drawing

it's a sheep

dinosaur

cleaver i

with a tail amount

but it still doesn't have legs

time

the tools for what

david koresh characteristics is at the lower make it carries

anything else we need to know

bunny rabbit

it's a rabbit i have a

at all fun

i draw a line and strong

one and as intelligent

sounds good

back to business back to the money part

from the finance department i've learned that we're aiming for a selling price of twenty-five euros and were hoping

can speak about what your experience with remote controls

what kind of ideas you have to design a new remote control maybe for which

i always lose them with i

they always lose them of buttons

it's not fun to use the remote

that's that you have a lot of rhode remotes row on remote control yes

the angle you have to use

the use of different devices

that's an idea

so they see in young could see them when you need "'em"

i have a cell you get in the same size remote control use every day but

changing channel

but not the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television hearing use those

hearing use those the first time or

so maybe minimise design the least impossible amount of buttons
