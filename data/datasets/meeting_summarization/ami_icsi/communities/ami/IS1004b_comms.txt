'cause you know men like to have control the remote so
and you have to find it with missus and they improvements we could do to the car and remote controls
and this remote control on the right here is one of the more extravagant but it's not
expensive they're a lot of expensive remote control that
'cause the thing is what what we were present this presentation that is what we want the remote control to actually do it and
because i'm not going to speak into the into the remote control so
the remote control so it could be so if you cindy minutes
depends if it's a remote control
we were so what would be the goal of putting an l. c. d. in our remote control

bad they they that they should have at the same importance and they're in the remote comes in the remote control
you should say like this that remote control being one or beyond kind of thing and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition because

this is not the multi get that's remote control where it's it's very simple there's only
we'll have a bit of a simple a task in that we're only doing a television remote control

it means like this remote here is kind of it's very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit big are all you know with maybe
and just to a look to see if they're actually available in any kind of remotes and then also

the the thing is the most remote controls are used by more than one person's
my personal preference was that we can have a us are sitting there on the remote control
so the remote as one bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of

we wanna decide it if we should go for universal specific remote control but i have new
i would if i had my perfect remote controller but we decide the numbers are all on it because they're just in the way they

what most of the people of thing that remote controls are oddly battery so i'm
so list people are what it about the shape of the remote control they are
they the younger people are they are more interested they i mean incorporating new technologies in the remote control
because what if people as see a remote see that see a remote control without numbers they were think it's very difficult to learn ready to go to the different be a baby teeth into it at each other
i people go through by you know as a remote control when they broke brought to hold and they want

we need to have a on a remote control which is fancy which is a
i mean do we need an extra internet connection to use a remote control on roles in addition to the t. what should be a special to you gonna do it
shame because even with you i don't you could even get teletext information from the t. v. on to the remote control especially if we don't control the t. v. i don't know we need to

control but i have new you we inputs for about that the peaks
there is no nor significant difference between the them the first know control
no it could be quite control kind of thing in
v. also so they should be something come on control you start and then you stop it's like we
but the thing i find most interesting about this remote control and it's kind of difficult to to see in a slide but it has a scroll-wheel on it which
it is instead of having a mortal which is to be trained and being a micro controller
unless we have some input some video input to the t. v. or we have control of the t. v. then we can actually display that like if we
you say we're focusing on t. v. but still kind of like a universal remote in that as a replacement remote control or is this something for a reminder of televisions "'cause"
i think it up the people that gonna wanna buy a very stylish a remote control what's new technology is the kind of people are we gonna have you know what i was internet connection maybe or

they get i'm ready betty often because they lost the remote control very often so
any be any a time or something corporate to do with the remote control it i mean you get lost
so they want has to restrict the remote control to t. v. only because of time mutations

so research in this topic i first of all the sort of a couple things i would like to see in a remote and just to a look
because really i think people want to be l. to find the button are looking for without even looking at the remote control
i think that incision to use this new remote control shouldn't be very they have looked pretty hard because what

and finally the incorporation all far as c. d. or a speech recognition see stand in the remote control could also interested but
maybe if the remote control something that you don't actually have to pick up any more that would be a useful feature the speech recognition if

i don't know i see anyway i think it could be an interesting to really some a smaller fraction of all these remote controls short

so it there's a pretty wide range of remote controls these days and

two roles more easily that you text for instance true through your remote control
