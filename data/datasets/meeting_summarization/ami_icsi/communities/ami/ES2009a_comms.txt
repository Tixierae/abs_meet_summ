you say like that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of x. have is to go with it and we'll discuss
now we also discussing kind of are initial ideas alone
so we've got this kind of an idea of a trade off between a size and functionality and then we
so if you guys what need a reminder about what we've talked about the different you know kind of trade off so we've got another ideas you can sort them a really

we're making a remote control which
a remote control which is growing
i assume that we're building a stand alone a remote control we can to kind
wants and all figure out the the specifications of a remote control
a remote control so

that's like you know forty bucks for remote it would have to
remote it would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me i'm so what we can
the wanna things that i was gonna mention to you and you guys the designers is that i am we probably near of it needs to be a universal remote control probably
maybe a remote changeable face it's like face they can buy for france
so you recommend like an l. like a touch screen type of remote
all the other universal remotes
because so many those remotes they say these universal remotes looks a cheap then we'll call you
without getting in the whole like you know good and the bargain store remote you know bars or universal remote it's black and

same way have an initial ideas
me however so initial ideas
so initial ideas
let's go ahead wrap that up here for now i'm gonna put these initial
i'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the project documents so if you guys

the economic we're gonna sell remote control that's the size of this paper but you know
can we pretty can we sell of remote controls on for quite a pound to us
metaphor bundling it in as for selling their telly with the remote

we've got to make something is fashionable "'s" possible that's kind of the corporate
about and finally we'll incorporate is kind of the last it in a way you guys build our tell me to tell us what's possible i mean you tell
we can to kind of build it into a either a product
we if we can have a four mobile phone me via remote has some other kind of useful function a clap
i think this material qualities like i what we can think about what kind of
what kind of you know the apples been really successful with the surgical white kind of business or the sleek kind of you know
remote it's black and you know massive some kind of
some kind of under a balance there in somewhere

so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things
i see and that can be done with kind of around the world
that are not selling out of forty pound remote way our forty dollar remote twenty five euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive so need
but i mean twenty five pounds a kind of hard currency

about the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate motto i don't know if
that i can't remember the idea
email as i did that the idea of yes the coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better
like an orc out i'm you just can't get a better breed of the what's available on this idea
i was gonna notice for future reference this idea of
i'll i'm like an idea this idea that touchscreen remote with more than format features
how like the idea of the of multi play-doh i
i think it would be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device maybe a simple

had kind small
had kind small
am like small little terrible television show but i happen a lot but
a small thing i went to high school
small world as we're discussing
in a decent they were like just a little look like literally just a very small kind of thing that

and that's for a really need you guys user interface designers and the they have their designer that i can't remember
and i am be user interface designer
to the powerpoint presentations for it could be designed specifically to ignore and it's they're brilliant
i'm thinking kind of p. d. a design so touchscreen
design so touchscreen design rather than button so
like these grey blizzard are gonna be in the this whole new what's design remotes

i the ditch worked we're making
i think making at it a material would be very important because so many
more l. c. d. press and it makes remote
and it makes remote page kinda

so i'm just gonna start this powerpoint look work
we're gonna go about doing that is the first we're gonna start on the basics
start and i'm carrie like five remotes around
but i think that is more or less a good place to start from now and it's more
could it be starting minutes
just something like keep in mind we start actually deal with the that

we're working for real reaction this
and then all work out from what is necessary to more like what would be good you know like
what do you need at u. c. santa barbara then you're working
barbara then you're working on a p. h. d. in psychology
probably will be still work visa for
be still work visa for a while and then the side
i'm so what we can maybe work on that later but we're
something so that's just they had back to work on what we're talking about for a

pretty easy like a shot at the same way
it's actually like we really have from from my house that pretty
that's pretty much get it's gonna be universal right

essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried that yet the whiteboard
so for now i just for the all the whiteboard just a used to it i haven't tried
to it i haven't tried it yet either
