had kind small
had kind small
you know maybe you like mean you want to use the speech but you wanna see
right the industrial designer hey
industrial designer hey i am i getting into it
getting into it
what do you need at u. c. santa barbara then you're working
for a big orchestra very
they like fifteen members from brooklyn
a cost less than eight pounds
i what i want to school here in santa barbara which
yes and university
small world as we're discussing
i'm not sold on this is pretty
of it u. i. d. you type to use i miss out there in you also
i think you can shake that
a one will discuss the trade offs in between and
we can to kind of build it into a either a product
maybe we should bring some are below what we wanted to go

arrow can still in a sign in a life
you say like that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of x. have is to go with it and we'll discuss
and we'll discuss it but i'm
it but i'm not gonna ask you know that area is indicate
it's a meeting and
and this coffee i
what we're trying to do so this remote for twenty five euros
this is what defined as a problem is told me the c. f. l. but

and then just a bit of discussion and close that
we've got to make something is fashionable "'s" possible that's kind of the corporate
that's kind of the corporate strategies we're gonna try to take ordinary that
are i'm sending everybody likes really fit some less or greater extent but there's some other options
but there's some other options if your t. v. slot like i
like an orc out i'm you just can't get a better breed of the what's available on this idea
different because in san diego that were tears circuit on the grown than rubber

he looks really tall like he's got any
off m. a. guy is
i've already got more than i can keep track of my
like a i think two bucks like literally
cafe forte
it's actually like we really have from from my house that pretty

you're pressing a thought kinda
kinda you'll see
night after we do if it's a very
yes street it's a it's
it's all horrible
just literally just met upon us any other like five minutes from

but it just too quick opening then we
energy to check the the corporate website
that if you catch your hand or something like that
to the powerpoint presentations for it could be designed specifically to ignore and it's they're brilliant
things to this you just can't play so like

i've seen more you're in the city than ever before i mean
i got this idea but
base and so you
base and so you need you tell us what we what the users can want to sell
what they're looking for

so i'm just gonna start this powerpoint look work
and that's for a really need you guys user interface designers and the they have their designer that i can't remember
that i can't remember the idea
the mexican police it's

life so
a remote control which is growing
on the whiteboard you can
internationally sold

a few years back at the same email as i did that the
no and i just a red apple and see i'm a big music
am like small little terrible television show but i happen a lot but
but i happen a lot but it's a rubbish but

there you can go wrong for you have to
so it really works just like a pen only makes noise is
remote it would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me i'm so what we can
gonna make a lot and the proper names to make fifty million euros on it internationally

in santa barbara which is central california the mexican
bucks like literally two boxes and nasa and that's
where you from san diego
true i we will probably have some time maybe we should bring some

you can harness you have some power
i miss out there in you also get it's assignments from in your emails morse best specifics what to do
so forth any questions before we get started
i assume that we're building a stand alone a remote control we can to kind

sold the wanna things that i
something that could be u. n. t. s. c. as as power was there is the format second is gonna control d. v. d.s but
but that's something that is gonna be international sold thing one
i haven't let me bring up something about our basic goals here what we want to accomplish project

right so i'm just gonna start
use yellow
come about because that right so there's an island

or if you guys in the same time if you like logically if something that's at the economic we're
i think we need those it
should admit that

sort of role playing see agree you gonna
see agree you gonna happen to your knowledge as that's the same
that's the same for your what we do introductions i mean a talk about your background and a half and you

so we are reinventing
we are reinventing the wheel but we
so north part actually if you wear a specific

we're gonna go about doing that is the first we're gonna start on the basics
the local have to be here for three years as a get the terminology
before special more often the same general region right so success

like that it's all work out from there and
really lame and
what else happened with me

enough you if you were trapped on a desert island in that only being five c. d.s along with you mean one of them that you could it not a five if you wanna write off i'd go
if you wanna write off i'd go for it but i mean one
that the main character

it's the five by five like a tree that much
and it's more things come up all have meetings and
or you know i can we pretty can we

like that's kinda getting into it right
right so just to take

up the meeting so we're working
we're working for real reaction this

it's coming can add to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting
to guide me in dallas on this project is you're gonna be you

quick opening then we can offer a get acquainted with one another
slide in there

we've got a general plan for the project or gonna do about accomplishing this and then just a
and make it and then all of this it the u. i. d. the i. d. you know you can keep on you know call it the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible

of course we can discuss and
of course we can discuss and thinking about a proposing that for since we've got this a weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask don't tell

the economic we're gonna sell remote control that's the size of this paper but you know
paper but you know you

the speech but you wanna see what the harvard or something like that one i you know
that's fine

is seen i we can have a lot of the fun with it so
with it so big as a curve at assessing

i the ditch worked we're making
be still work visa for a while and then the side

we're making a remote control which
so for now i just for the all the whiteboard just a used to it i haven't tried

about the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate motto i don't know if
motto i don't know if you guys had time to check the enough energy

ordinary that nobody really thinks that and try to
i just came from glasgow and i'm

and try to make it you know like john lewis
it's a basic i grew up listening to

you know you reckon that you can't be that you can't have you know x. m. y. at the same time
kinda weird anyway

about and finally we'll incorporate is kind of the last it in a way you guys build our tell me to tell us what's possible i mean you tell
i mean you tell us what we can hope for and what would it go take the

to kind of synch it all up so that's the detail
so that's the detail designed to three state

i'm sarah i went to michigan
i went to michigan and

and i'm the marketing manager something marketing
expert the place

run once upon a time studied and victoria and i am
pen only makes noise is i think it's

veteran from california and we're doing
and we're doing a mass screen social apology

what to get a mexican right dancing tell you that you watch or whatever you want
i i'll go next right or

state local michigan folk singer really lame
can we pretty can we sell of remote controls on for quite a pound to us

a is it you watch any season
are you get the on line there is a i'm

yes as a cancer yes
i'm so what we can maybe work on that later but we're

there's more of a man that
right ming

it will hear this
that project finance

pretty easy like a shot at the same way
you need a lot

my grandparents lived on thirty second
to your workload when coffee shop the sand

right so success on the whiteboard
so that's interesting

v. d.s but you know a way that's you guys
one try to make it for twelve fifty so we want

i have it is we're also that yet so
maybe or personal coach will that's me to say

i'm certainly open it seems like this is in the
like this is in the could certainly doable isn't it i mean

we if we can have a four mobile phone me via remote has some other kind of useful function a clap
or ninety no they be a good

no they be a good idea was it is you
maybe a remote changeable face it's like face they can buy for france

hi
i like the wheel covers thingys

how we placed in terms of right

'cause she product that's true

like it's very hard to drink coffee

powerpoint

just to take up the meeting

for real reaction this is also a right

with one another the words are talk a little bit about tool training essentially that means

essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried that yet the whiteboard

i want to i'm just gonna you get of course we can discuss and

if you say something about marketing bright sort of

but we if we will go from there for enough

you can this is seen i we

big as a curve at assessing want to call

know like john lewis nicer or you know if you get the data and do something

the wheel but we wanna try to do it in user-friendly slick sleek kind of way

the idea the u. i. d. a. right

is you're gonna be you get you guys at the bottom you know you reckon

and then all work out from what is necessary to more like what would be good you know like

email as i did that the idea of yes the coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better

it's also better if it's not like really cheap class that if you catch your

and then we'll meet on and talk

take the take the basics and make it and

designed to three state kind of thing

to it i haven't tried it yet either

it yet either i'm just gonna start and i'm

start and i'm carrie like five remotes around

and just write down i'm just gonna write down what it means of my there's a guest enough you if you

we skip interactions

an excellent project manager i'm marty

i'm marty what do

barbara then you're working on a p. h. d. in psychology

and then hearing cultural studies and i'm the marketing

expert fine

of the expert

and i am be user interface designer

right so there's an island desks

to get away if you're a terrier tell us

tell us a way to know

see i'm a big music that i don't know if you guys

that i don't know if you guys are i'm sending everybody

a small thing i went to high school

i went to high school at a modelling actually

the guy

very much that colour

much that colour soccer player but at a low bastard

but at a low bastard normalise

like he's got any like six

he's a big guy

as to just backlight

let's go "'cause" like not very many people have

i'm as of rubber this person in there

or lose all my mike this point in here

point in here it's

it's just pay in practice are

you're much taller than me some write down here

some write down here

right now i'm listening to a lot of some you know we never heard of chris bath state

probably classical to time

classical to time we teach i think

and my same a guy d. v. d.s that we do need to write that

that we do need to write that one down so

i think those are downloading

line there is a i'm that be

i did last night after

and i'm hoping they are the culture in belgium contrast also in a proper is there was be in brussels

exciting

there was be in brussels on it

thing i love about enron

it's a triple a.

and i'm happy to say that there's the same quantity approximately

slide in there

i'm going local the local have

as a get the terminology right

i can keep track of my maybe go home next week and everything like you

and everything like you regard you train it a one of those people you know

do you get home yet they'll

yet they'll be like say something pretty easy like

like you see gonna stay here

probably will be still work visa for

something and i spent my hometown

two bucks

where you're from california by the way

what way a t. v. peachy

a man

go in this like an orc out i'm

on the grown than rubber cover this team them

it must make all the difference

other like five minutes from this or so north part actually

as we're discussing before special

harness you have some power little bit interactions we talked about somewhere c. d.s and things

d.s and things we like about the same i think

right so moving on to not fun

moving on to not fun that

what we're trying to do

sold on this is pretty here i mean

here i mean twice

that's like you know forty bucks for remote it would have to

later but we're gonna make a lot and the

the wanna things that i was gonna mention to you and you guys the designers is that i am we probably near of it needs to be a universal remote control probably

so we want rather make a hundred percent profit on if we can

straight so i'm just a close that i'm

just a close that i'm not how much time ideas and next time

ideas and next time right project manager sort of

is that will mean the other half an hour or so

so and like the industrial then you get you think about what needs to be done like what the basic function of it

actually the way you guys could maybe in our next meeting to have a bit about what the users gonna want you want to use you can have you know like

say specific instructions will be sent in your email but i think

but i think that is more or less a good place to start from now and it's more

have meetings and you can email so forth

for instance like a mobile phone or something like that

isn't it i mean we if we can have a four

to go back to i haven't let me
