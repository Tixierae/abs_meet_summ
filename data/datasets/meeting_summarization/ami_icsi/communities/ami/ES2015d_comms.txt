here and this would be the powerpoint the on off button and
and then other one is the power and are
are we just have a sample design we want
a sample design we want is all to be accessible
it's palm how
accessible from your cell am house and
buttons are accessible from some
that's another number ten button
that was a mistake "'cause"
right now that's euro i
i was in charge
i was in charge of the north i
but work i
and this is just so you've got like eleven or twelve or fruit reports if you go one
so one plus one eleven or
if you go one three years and then press
press that first and then you go one three
i've never heard of that kind of four
which you have to zero plus one if you want to go to channel one or two
all that so we have all these numbers these
all these numbers some
'cause that press the plastic after it's
it's like a five second input time so
input time so as long as it happened to that
of place
are we thinking that things are having in interchangeable cases anyway that this
use all the combination
device you don't need to use both hands one hand the whole this and type immediately can just use your thumb
could work everyone
come on my computer
discussed function it again
sign or not we are a lot
so number one do we have
and it's not the kind of but it's all sleek red black and yellow
not very sleek
not very sleek and we don't wanna go
it's a mango i mango
so i know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative
and the use the rubber
i think it's can we get confused
the plus system but once that's figured out it should be fine
again i think the colour comes into this
i think that logo could be smaller
and maybe not a problem in way you look at the bottom
you look at the bottom kind of
remember the managements that the that it had to be a problem
just not touch it i said was the
i said was the three i killed i was is only
i was is only of it should be like flat or
but i wouldn't say that's called lane you
it's topic of people it's
details
it's know if that's a good looking remote would you wanna show not
would you wanna show not friends
and the kinetic energy part
part i
they're a ball
shake it or not but it's
they clearly that easy to use

i it might actually up with repetitive stress injury as
it could another type of repetitive stress injury that but i know i
my computer screen we technical difficulties so i press
a side of the touch
the plus number thing
remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly
they're still be fair be on
the plus thing is to work done

watch what do you reckon sample or it so
'cause it quite subtle and
more settled cream instead of the others or a bit garish
with all the components
and your pinkie on the market in
minimise the effects of r. s. i. which was

it's in the middle of one of the lawyers
but at is more representative of our colour scheme like the company the yellow and black
so that for a corpora i don't see that would probably be there is very good i mean what's
good i mean what's and there will probably appealing to the seasonal
seasonal
things like that i it's not going anywhere think you mean

this is that we cannot with a it's a
know very low might be the most popular fetus the buttons in more settled
i would say two personally
fanciness
numbers sex concern read it out

am house and
alright underscores up on that
we're only given red and black
red black and yellow and orange
five what is people be willing

is average "'cause" there were some people they use the video input and sound and but then that's
number seven
number seven could have that you push
remember the future some users lose their remote regularly there's the idea
we have the alarm system

i we have their company look or here and this will be there
change it's and as you push down wants
colour would that would be a factor
could have that you push it down that's remote control be

economic definitely remote
like a banana group like it never would rather than grew you know very low
the and then you know it's more for the more sophisticated i just thought i thought that for some with all the core
it's less what

my goodness i could get you could
evaluation criteria six mine
so question number one does the remote pops
if they're actual depends on your mood

use the whiteboard it may be adjusted on right on the screen we can see it i'm
i leds isn't particularly innovative and
can we get confused or that i mean
or that i mean they'll be used to wear to work out the a number the plus system but once

and we'll evaluate as to whether we've spent what we said to do
and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false so
so the warp or lower the points the better
one do we have a fancy look-and-feel

which is a little speaker on the back or something
use the same lights are on the prototype but l. b. that
you just press six enter or
or want to enter

i think point
question number nine
s. i. which was repeated strain injury
your thumb might get a little bit

i have a a spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of what we need to do our options and town
it will be easy to use
straightforward good

do you need the powerpoint for this
i just got a few slides to sort of
with all the components that steph me focus of economics and to just a single how hand-held device you

these numbers all work independently opting nine
but if i wanna go to say number like sixty five to channel sixty five to press the six it'll go to channel six and now press the plus and then we've got a six and then put the five another sixty five
sky-high a senator gramm icsi like that

but i mean if you press it'll go to that channel right away "'cause" that press
see i think we've been quite successful
it has waited maybe details

no you press the plus first i'll pull
a problem but i'm just wondering like
i'm just wondering like as long as we realise that's what we'll do

pricewise is not as nothing
that there is that there's a delay on remotes i think where you can have it
where you can have it's like a five second

where where's the power button
maybe it can be on the bottom so you wouldn't
it was simplistic so people can just see it and think this is so simplistic i do want to spend twenty five euros we have to market it

and so now that we if we have a prototype we need to go over the finances and seeing
i don't know is for rubber i mean if
for rubber i mean if you can visualise this in colours i think you would that quick thoughts

could just for use the whiteboard it
definitely afraid
it's not a traditional

and we don't wanna go for park because most remote controls or black or grey so we
black or grey so we want it to be standard that way anyway
metallic you finish your thing

these are the rubber the use of d. l. e. d.
for the anti r. s. i.
the bottom could be like top of it

and so we don't have any scroll buttons it's all pushbuttons
no but this sample
we don't want it anymore in that "'cause"

all pushbuttons is no l. c. d. controls so if we thinking
so you can't see the alarm but it would like to
and we have to be in the market

but when a lounge not if you
it turns into a doctor's cracking
alarm and if it was hidden underneath a cushion or something won't be any point so you

have a wasn't very clear
question rate it be easy
the powerpoint slide things said would be good for r. s. i. "'s"

and town evaluate the product as a group and
a it's a pretty simple design that

so for so have the prototype presentation do you
i'll pull it does that we have a

mango week and
mangoey too

all which i thought we have all the numbers here so we wanted something and representative of numbers or shouldn't and
thirty that like want us to use it goes to what's what's two plus two is channel to me too

no the plus on it for a second pass the number nine
doesn't make more sense for the middle what's been just an enter button so then

i do get a fair
i do get a fair to define that

that but i know i mean it's a different movement so
and the feel of it i mean we've made this else can you go which is representing the united about that and a spongy we have enough

but the stress ball field
i think the cat has a lot to do with it i mean all

of on the whiteboard i can't
but you have to buy batteries so in the long term

i mango
i the mango here if they're

two three
three

in some aspect is like you said
that's a relief to re

we want simple
so i mean i will put three

that "'cause" number three it will be easy to
the lights on and off last job i

i like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand
what where's the case that kind of that so that if all

you but no "'cause" that it and transmit also
i think there's another colour and it was like a book

kind i'm not happy with that is correct
at question number five what

and the marketing let's do it then
off last job i mean it's not obvious to be obvious from outside the what's gonna happen "'cause" you can't have to take me see you know

i think i tend not at ten point at me
at me like ten points

concern read it out
does the sports that much the operating behaviour of the out of reach use that

changing and it's just you won't have to think about that you don't have to look down
that you don't have to look down to find them they clearly

easy to use simple
i the any the keyword there is average "'cause" there were

a lot of room for like
think it if it was have an alarm system i mean when it

has to be see the pick it up and know what to do the plus thing is to work
so the plot the plus what's

so it's is like the channel six and there
that kind of annoys me know when it's zero six and you have to press that are we

and then like twelve enter
and all of sixty six and

we may have to do some research in the the strain injury so we don't know about
the biology

biology
but it's soft

here it care

right the agenda for of it all

the agenda for this meeting is will initially have the prototype presentation there are two designers and then we'll evaluate

and then we'll evaluate it can the criteria that that we keys david and

and talk about our finances whether we were and euro for our budget i have a

design that based on a mango week

mango

it's in the battle for the dollars and then

am house and all that

was a mistake "'cause" that right now

all you press a plus but

on me on average remote if you pressed ones y. c. d. is going to all the same you want to channel twelve you press one thing that channel one and then to need just go to channel two instead of twelve thirty that like

it's the plus there

we have a i would've thought

i would've thought you press spokesperson and six five but

and six five but she's this was i watch what do you reckon

i would've thought to be a problem they want to channel six first in like on the way to channel sixty five

wouldn't be a problem but

it should be fine those

those are deposited in into balance

was it is and on the top there is volume and

and channel which is so

which is so you could just go like that without thinking about the like

channel up a limo

just so we can reflect

it's a big are

so it's a six which

so it's a like stress ball was like in taking your hand off the remote

we went to make sake in the design for the know that because it was

that because it was kind of a more natural movement and just going like that with your thumb the economics

the economics are considered

economic definitely

the spongy

because it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti r. s. i. e. materials often used and stress balls so this is

stress balls so this is got a you know a bit of give to it and it just

give to it and it just feels real difference

real difference like theory is that how it fits in the palm

how it fits in the palm of your hand

could get you could the ratio

it's all i think a couple five i did

like the four god

god

at so the cat is they will send it with them a limited range of colours for this prototype are we

that's often

that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours so we would necessarily use all the combination

i was thinking to carry on with the fruit and vegetable theme the colour like a combination just to be named after a different fruit like a banana

do like the middle and banana would

kinda christmas you know

apple green brown we'll try to train d. u. m. card key

the pomegranate a big guarantee and phone keychain the and

as is that the rubber as we used to come to an anti r. s. i. and that's about

thank you very much could work everyone

and seeing if this prototype match is that what our budget can handle so

energy need to do a presentation first

i dunno what ordered goes and i

i'm gonna check that out for sake

another issue that's me

o. g. e. come on my computer

see it i'm gonna be doing in evaluation report together based on the prototype that we've just seen

and looking back to my notes from our but our conceptual more functional meetings i made a list of what our original requirements and goals were

goals were back to our kick-off meeting this morning and

of on the whiteboard i can't change it's

we've been quite successful with a rubber kind of thing

the look is a little bit more playful

is it has a definition of fancy like different

like different it's not a traditional

do with it i mean all the colours we were given for making a prototype the colours that i think we wouldn't necessarily cherries and it's not

they if you can imagine that in like i was just it may beam a kind of pay you all that's how like you finished or something

college only two

i can i like the potato like it's very different

say my god for a bad

i worry i know it

it's very different how is

it's a it's right phases one

terribly that's really that's

i see that's pro as we get confusing so

so question number two that's is it tech and technologically innovative so

controls so if we thinking about the rest of the market it's all for we halfway in

i'll go for three it's

we will we don't want to be more innovative and that's because then i would have defeated the purpose so

there's a specification

but i think we actually reach a goal

fairy i think one

is a good looking remote remember that

it's sad

as far as i recall quite big

but you know what i've just thought as that night what where's the case

so that if all of the art of this whole five

maybe if the bottom as a sort of flat and the rest is

and the rest is like

it's we can handle the

do like if it's flat here so it's up like that

off all over all the time of you know in

a book maybe two

i would definitely go sour of them like an average plain old remote like that

and i get yes press on taste but

like that death mean another kind i'm not happy with that

people be willing to spend twenty five euros on this product remember

on this product remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control look fancy

i think we have to market it in the right way but just say that it was simplistic so

we have to market it

and be kinetic energy you shake a style we do

i dunno what the plus you

no i i don't know much about the remote control industry how much an average cells for but

marketing expert

i know i am i nine

like ten points but

so in the long term this crashes city many so market it that way

so market it that way to

good point

so i think with a good marketing scheme and the personalisation options so

so that was me with that the statistics it said

it said

because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the channel changing and

that's remote control be easy to find when lost remember

there's the idea is a line

is a line systems tall was it implemented

when you press the wants to the lights i don't think that

i thought the light on the inside was going like that

the light it will

i mean when it lights up as a i mean you could light up when the alarm and if

i thought was originally use

i'll be can't see it and i'll on inside because the alarm system itself

it a one because compared to be the remote ever and ever made this one will be easier to fight

no problem

it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brian you remember that thirty

when brian you remember that thirty four percent of users usually find it difficult so it

what's up button down on the page that would be really simple

just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons i think that in itself makes it so much easier to use

button so then you would have to press two buttons every time at least

we don't have to press euros

i think that's probably more straightforward

which affected a over a quarter of users

but if you're stopping

i still like the walls

and that's kind of why the

and people could

i dunno what other options there are
