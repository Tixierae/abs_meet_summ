is a good looking remote remember that
it's know if that's a good looking remote would you wanna show not

all which i thought we have all the numbers here so we wanted something and representative of numbers or shouldn't and
all these numbers some
these numbers all work independently opting nine
so question number one does the remote pops
so question number two that's is it tech and technologically innovative so
at question number five what
numbers sex concern read it out
question number nine
number time do we somehow incorporate

all you press a plus but
no you press the plus first i'll pull

but at least special colour
special colour we use know
so i was like special colour will have two colours right

number seven
number seven could have that you push

so one plus one eleven or
no the plus on it for a second pass the number nine
the plus number thing
has to be see the pick it up and know what to do the plus thing is to work
so the plot the plus what's
the plus thing is to work done

but if i wanna go to say number like sixty five to channel sixty five to press the six it'll go to channel six and now press the plus and then we've got a six and then put the five another sixty five
i would've thought you press spokesperson and six five but
i would've thought to be a problem they want to channel six first in like on the way to channel sixty five
so it's is like the channel six and there
and all of sixty six and

i said was the three i killed i was is only
so will you think that's more of a three then three
then three four
so that's three contrast
we're using kinetic which is quite large expensive three euros
three ready at five

for rubber i mean if you can visualise this in colours i think you would that quick thoughts
again i think the colour comes into this
colour would that would be a factor
i think there's another colour and it was like a book
do we somehow incorporate the company colour logo know is the colour
the colours are yellow and grey so
one colour for the case one colour for the buttons so we can
i'm a real people so the modify each colours ideas

on me on average remote if you pressed ones y. c. d. is going to all the same you want to channel twelve you press one thing that channel one and then to need just go to channel two instead of twelve thirty that like
thirty that like want us to use it goes to what's what's two plus two is channel to me too
which you have to zero plus one if you want to go to channel one or two
but i mean if you press it'll go to that channel right away "'cause" that press

if you go one three years and then press
press that first and then you go one three
'cause that press the plastic after it's
my computer screen we technical difficulties so i press
and i get yes press on taste but
that kind of annoys me know when it's zero six and you have to press that are we
we don't have to press euros
you just press six enter or

that there is that there's a delay on remotes i think where you can have it
so it's a like stress ball was like in taking your hand off the remote
economic definitely remote
remember the future some users lose their remote regularly there's the idea
it a one because compared to be the remote ever and ever made this one will be easier to fight

and we don't wanna go for park because most remote controls or black or grey so we
all pushbuttons is no l. c. d. controls so if we thinking
controls so if we thinking about the rest of the market it's all for we halfway in
remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly
on this product remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control look fancy
could have that you push it down that's remote control be
that's remote control be easy to find when lost remember
support so i mean we did as much stick our remote control

device you don't need to use both hands one hand the whole this and type immediately can just use your thumb
and so now that we if we have a prototype we need to go over the finances and seeing
energy need to do a presentation first
so we need to tell how much i will are our product will be costly so
so we need to do a project evaluation again which is probably
so it be like need more time and but to lose but
we need more plato colours

where you can have it's like a five second
it's all i think a couple five i did
so that if all of the art of this whole five
five what is people be willing
it was simplistic so people can just see it and think this is so simplistic i do want to spend twenty five euros we have to market it
so average their five six eight ten eleven twelve thirteen fifteen nineteen twenty one divided by a lot then
