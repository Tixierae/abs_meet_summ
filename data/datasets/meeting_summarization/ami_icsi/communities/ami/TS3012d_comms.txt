apple which you can't do with a normal remote control which people already
control which people already do so

can you talked a remote control
just a few pre what the fourth you can talk to your remote control doesn't do you think we did i

'cause if you just end up with an entirely black remote control
it is you deliver basic remote control with a possibility changed into whatever you want
to separate from the rest of the remote control world so to speak so we keep the curve
for that so i think we can take that option just with the idea the back of a hat that you can customise remote control so i
i think he l. c. d. display it could be a little bit more difficult than a normal remote so but then again it for
the banana remote or something i dunno
step and it features of remote control your t. v.
your remote control
the first one looks like it's a triple remote control but it's only a single

and then a special colour suppose yellow's a special colour so
suppose thirteen so i had to get the special colour suppose and
special colour
have like i said i lost the speech recognition i was a special colour we
special colour we should make this like a black and grey that's
but the colours we don't have special colours and

so the buttons the look and feel i thought
look and feel it every but it's true

and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls
existing remote controls these are all plastic so which in
that makes you think of different price the remote control really

yes but in the end product so
in the end product

that would i would just be straight remote just like that
no that it would turn out to be a pretty straight forward remote control so but it's not

real reaction remote control are free see
but it's only a single remote control has a special note
has a special note people are that's important real reaction remote

gives a total of seventeen euros in production cost which
so we have everything in the product we have the costs
in the product we have the costs we have the

recognition and the separate covers in account for the if people want or just
some place talking to my mind is that something that really can afford from the marketing research is that people like the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of that and it really makes
the people want to pay for for it so why
i hope the people will like it
it's perfect even for they have people
but then again it for young people so
thought it was it i thought the people wanna previews on their i'm not that
that people really want speech recognition then they must be prepares to but to pay more "'cause" it's
numbers also mean this to the people i mean

and everything that's left is the basic function that they we want our product to have you
because you could have also to designs what the same time this manufacturing one product one basic product
one basic product which you could turn into any case you want so
as a package it does it's not part of the basic product

i think they colour is more important than the really the crew "'cause" if you just
cover so you can change we do any colour you want so
i all sort of basic colours up
i'd say you lose the curve and the colour and
i would say i would agree with you on the colour because that's an
all the trends know colour so anymore so
it's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model

we take plastic for the basic over and
you can take plastic but at

materials would be a look at least
it just looking for a pro was what you could have improved
is yellow you should look here
look here so screwed up because
the car did you say look this as you're doing the wrong thing
the design a look at the one thing
but look stupid
it looks you predefined looks people
