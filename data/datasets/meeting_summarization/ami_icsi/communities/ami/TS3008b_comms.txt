control remotely
what a remote controls nowadays can last two years three years with two batteries

a wide scale of remote controls in the world and
i haven't come to your remote i've got some images of remote controls were
was the technical side of the remote control
shall we have to think of that the remote control
is we haven't got remote control for i think
there are a dozen of dozens of remote controls that have
remote control
fattening and then you can always find remote control but
we use it is in the most costly the remote control we can save

but it i think that's very important still what so what kind of functions there are we want to put in the remote control
the but the functions are not in the remote control we're making
maybe it's made it's something to them but most of the time these functions don't support a particular device as as their own remote control in a lot of t. v.
a in the base or we could like make up a button and if you push it the remote control it's else makes noise there's

i'm gonna make a decision on the remote control functions we have forty
that means we can discuss on the remote control functions
to be honest if our l. a. group is till forty not a lot of forty maybe that's not very no we don't really need to have a simple remote control i
if it's too simple word that they won't use the remote control they use their own the bit lot more functions

what functions do we have to decide on
we've decided on functions

regardless of what type of functions we want to implement doesn't really matter
control i think we can implement more functions then because
control we can save on the functions we just put

ask whether common remote control looks good or not about

i think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote controls gonna be in that
them maybe it should be remote control when you clap your hands it makes a noise or some "'kay" to kind of thing

were not very trendy or just just a remote control like everyone knows i

know it's really depending on how far the remote controls are already in the the euros

the circuit board it's the most important part of the remote control we can use
remote control is nothing special a nonissue
i think it's very import because we gonna make such a basic remote control we have to do something to make it special it's gonna cost twenty

you don't think it's a problem to design the technical part of remote controls gonna
i think in the case of this simple remote control the technical aspects which it won't work so out already but it shouldn't be a problem then

i just i thought euros was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets and i don't know
look at the market
i mean it looks trendy and say this to put a bleep function in it but

i think you can make some discussion the distinctions in what cut and no that just in functions you have i
you know we should the put some functions for other maybe for other quick madonna but just
maybe if we just leave the d. v. d. function alima
come to that but it first on the functions so we should
and we can deliver that it would be the record should functions because
some of the extra function

gonna be in that already talked about maybe you familiar with your remote control that has the can opener underneath it i think we're
the like the can open it may be contains some future date you don't normally linked to the remote control i think it's very
i have to say i have to stuck can opening remote control i have most of the hour i think it's
