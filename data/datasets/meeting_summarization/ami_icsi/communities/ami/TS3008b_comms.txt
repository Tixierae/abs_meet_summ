welcome at the functional design meeting again presented by martin
energy it activated chip in the remote it's an electrical circuit
it's an electrical circuit which compose messages in the form of infrared signals to control the television
against a fair price it's
it's a common technology like at all the circuit board
we can use for that fibreglass with copper wires is
i'm making it all the time
remote control is nothing special a nonissue
there are a look at least basic functions like
like just the channels one till nine or one and also
group features for a higher usability
you know it's just you want to be able to make use of teletext button that's to play with it that much shall we have to think of
that the remote control should only be used for television otherwise the project becomes more complex which endangers time lot of time to market so
and i think that that's what they're trying to say our current
our current customers are within the age group of forty plus new product
one so maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group but isn't that for more person you our corporate
i'll have a look
we put the fashion in electronics
sensitivity
control remotely
there are a dozen of dozens of remote controls that have
and simple what will
maybe it's maybe you do but i've never heard of it in the first place and
that's that's considered to be trendy also
you didn't we in quick you have to use it's very quickly
no is it just signals and the television the there's the rest
which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house
who was something about that how we lose them maybe
at i'm not this was put inside but it's like a statue or something or

and i'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements that were sent to me i'm gonna make a decision
and is not very specialised a technology
was the technical side of the remote control
and i think they're we have to focus on the one hand the experts if you all or none of issues
once i've received from the account manager
plus new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty so you
it's a very small market which we will project and if we want to reach customers younger than forty it's
what was our slogan
so what should we put it function in i think no i
we have different kind of equipment in your room like a ticket t. v. or the d. v. d. player you can
the d. v. d. player you can knowing that you can make
ellen but they from my experience is kind a lot of d. v. d. players you know like for reading goes different be you could
but do you like to have such just start button do
how much time and that's more than
them maybe it should be remote control when you clap your hands it makes a noise or some "'kay" to kind of thing
swap a ball front or whatever
fifty percent off and loses remote control

a fixer whatever
lots i got these two and
requirements that's no was going
but it i think that's very important still what so what kind of functions there are we want to put in the remote control
if you want try you which markets if you want to reach you use markets like elderly people mu have to choose form of issues butts i don't
other functions like audio settings video settings sound settings are not set to be very important and a very much used for them or
that doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off but it says we should make it to complicated fifty
fifty percent also claims to have lost the remote control very often in the room and
and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or you know
our corporate image should stay recognisable in our product for product corporate
i think we're looking for somewhere we're
maybe it's made it's something to them but most of the time these functions don't support a particular device as as their own remote control in a lot of t. v.
no no you know the number

opening we've got three presentations and i'm gonna show you some
i think it's a kind of very rare a special function
volume should we do we make them very big the said button that is
never know but
but it and i think we have to make it quite big
could be icky i think
you want to be something you know it's not doesn't have much functions are going to be
yes it is it should be if it be visible nearly anywhere in the room as i
in the room as i as i said do my presentation fifty percent

this is the agenda opening
basic functions
it's too much integrated the other
at the teletext button should be there but
a big buttons flashy design and maybe some kind of cages kind of thing
not brainstorm
has to be a form for your hand
so i also because it is expensive you want

one than the marketing expert can do something about the current market
alright i've done some research for a functional requirements
the working method there
and a trendy look all the all seven percent of the market is consists of elderly people at who don't really care for trendy look so whatever i it can do no harm to make a trendy for the other thirty percent
lots of newer televisions can store pages you know and you can just get menu it through them using i
i don't know if we have to stiff specifically name all the functions mean we want
we have to zap buttons the volume should
i think the plus an a minus button should be quite present

i think in we have to do it in the right order and maybe the
a wide scale of remote controls in the world and
the circuit board it's the most important part of the remote control we can use
think so because after all the televisions there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with a new functions but
but is it useful to put them on a standard the remote
i think that's guy getting too complex for our remote i don't know what you
i it's an l. sunday i always use it for the

i just i thought euros was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets and i don't know
there were hundreds or one hundred people are how do you say watched using remote controls and usability lab
in there are a lot of options there so we can really make an now do you say we can spare buttons over there and
and if you want to implement v. c. r. and d. v. d. options group them in the button not to
thank you and a trendy look
so you talk about the elderly you are willing to spend more on the remote control and were interested but
useful if you have a page which consists of more pages and you are not a very quick read or

i find them up there ask
ask whether common remote control looks good or not about
gonna use or not some thing you throw away next week you know
on the television
is it a button in that
l. c. don't even need batteries because you can make it a try should hold

make that happens next time
it diodes about batteries and that a led lights are needed and they're as they're available against
i dunno if you got the same pictures as i got lots
shall we have to think of that the remote control
that's why lot of do you do requirements the account manager send me i think there are contradicting each other because they want

but i maybe it's because of the time
you know we should the put some functions for other maybe for other quick madonna but just
it on the tape what i think you might wanna put it
more like a joystick and
maybe you but we don't know much about production cost but when you

we have forty minutes
this is the closing already so
three out of four people claim and to find remote controls ugly so
just play stop rewind and fast forward

but is it is a big that distinction between this time for most we should
most not of volume of course and the mute function and of course an extra previous channel i think there's
and the more other functions
a six basic

yes i agree
relevance options are of course power buttons although only used once per hour channel selection
other because they want a simple design and no other functions and just if you but taste do aim at the younger format
keep it simple and look more

wrong side we shouldn't implement
what do you think you'd issue we implement features that of functions that to control other devices know you don't think
and it's just so that a compliment area remote and the universe want if you want to keep it simple
it's only for television so

no the user requirements of the new pretty i was told is not too but maybe
i the buttons should make it possible to zap through the channels a rabbit ever pays
what should we decide and then
it also for you maybe we should it's very when you can be and try to include trendy in a row as a friend user-friendly as a big

so we should put zap buttons on it
then i think it's very irritating it in the next page shows up but
the not the below watch kind of the most
ten minutes i think "'s"

difficult is not a very common function and people who have to read up on their remote and
there's probably stupid but at s.
but when you can imagine a when you spend twenty five euros a remote control it's basic remote control and then the money it must be money to spend on that kind of just you know rechargeable six units
it should only cost twelve and a half euros of course

look at the market
so we have to choose for the simple design i
original right
but like so for phones something like that

i don't know what remote or so
on this on the zap buttons you can put it to eight to x. is all the same page is if you have
up a you have to put it on it's so it's like a of a sore or something you put a table at i'm not

this one was used to open a new one
in the world and the components are very very cheap
can you might as fast as printing paper it's

nothing restrict that's for a user interface
time for most we should choose one though we should
unless you for as a strange

we can put functions shane it's one when we get a user requirements and we can updated
one though we should not compromise but we choose for expert few or no first
so if you make a trendy design and we have seventy five percent of the market which we can reach

more trendy design i think
things we do better market
covered yet so i think that's but the problem is we haven't

usability lab and they also fill out a questionnaire with a few questions i
small buttons so when they won't be very how do you say
but that's kinda we should do on the internet right now this

about willingness to spend money on a remote control about
then we i'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and we gonna
as a strange

said buttons are used four hundred and sixty eight times per hour that's quite
i think no i think people younger people more looking for just a trendy look then more functions
is sometimes a bit difficult maybe if we

channel selection volume and buttons for text and
it's only like thirty percent of the total market made
maybe we can compromise a little but not too much them

because in this is as good that's a good two additional requirements for work
no but i think we have to just keep in mind what the older h. two one so maybe we can
internet right now this one that was said in the in using of new requirements

somewhere we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic t. v. functions
v. functions that
to be honest if our l. a. group is till forty not a lot of forty maybe that's not very no we don't really need to have a simple remote control i

that you can make very you can put very detailed functions regarding the t. v. set on your remote controller with two you know audio settings and a screen settings we don't want that
or we call you we could put them behind the clap or whatever
i think remote control for television you don't need to be able to program the v. c. r. to start recording at three p. m. or whatever just play stop

come to that but it first on the functions so we should
also numbers to to go to the specific channels
your something is on maybe with balancing pets which you can just throw it on the for something that has to be something

maybe we can make it a kind of a joystick
the like the can open it may be contains some future date you don't normally linked to the remote control i think it's very
it's gonna cost twenty five euros

then i think it's gonna be very it has to be sturdy your something is on
but what we were here when it gets lost how do you press the button to man
with the recharger

very rarely
so the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext browsing you know like on and off and don't make

may we should start with that technical functions
but we have to think wood with think d. v. d. i've i ellen but they

how can i get this on the whiteboard
or is it you dump the file in the initiate the project documents folder if all rather than that

it's no this very no technology
no technology can make the cost very low

copper wires is
i use it you said that a lot of functions aren't used so what should we

now it's it's just a part of and technology
but they're not relevant because we're are aiming at a young or

know it's really depending on how far the remote controls are already in the the euros
from that on we can see it's use requirements what we need more

i think there's just basic what we need and from
we are having in of you think about that thought about that how we can what's the extra touch can be just

you can just you can if you take t. v. d.
you take t. v. d. mind that i dunno

i haven't really found the conclusion like that
i think it's a good idea

for them or fifty percent says they only use ten percent of the buttons on the remote control that doesn't
all the settings about how do you settings video settings and channel settings which are not very often used we could group them one button and make them accessible in one menu button or whatever because there are

and elderly people want our market or less interested in a features but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls
we shouldn't implement too much features on on our remote control because the elderly people will that last group features

what i was climbing in the previous meeting
let's go back to them you can

and we gonna discuss and what features we find important
some of the new requirements make some of your findings quite set irrelevant i think

they said that it teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet i think
i think that maybe so but we can't just leave the teletext button off it's impossible

you will have to look that up
i dunno now but a lot of people like to have such cat and i kind of date kind of things to them should

that's in electronics
so tonight the three presentations we

i think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote controls gonna be in that
but you said the

gonna be in that already talked about maybe you familiar with your remote control that has the can opener underneath it i think we're
but maybe we should put some fun i know

some fun i know that the younger people most likely have a d. v. d. player they want to
if it's too simple word that they won't use the remote control they use their own the bit lot more functions

madonna but just the basic functions maybe like rewind and wonder what the what do you guys
but you can put "'em" under the same button

so i dunno quiet say so
but you can put a play and stop and then all rewind

was thinking about putting in the in mind concerning the project requirements would use is i think we should focus on the t. c. then
you can make the channel one why not

should be there but just one big that is for the on and off
fifty percent

than that i think stop function is very useful if
what functions do we have to decide on

something or something special way to zap through the yes the it is
it but you also can put it somewhere between the

what has to be simple one i will
but the what's already been done

i think that's more for a fun age range of ten to twelve or whatever
they did it stands up a

so maybe it is i think that's when when we decide and this type of functions know basic functions it's very important to find something like that so it's not
standard or something

and user-friendly
and user-friendly

remote control
kind of day i've never seen that before you make it and they use you'd with the mother the mouses nowadays

more money for us
percent was it fifteen fifty percent

and mouse not working anymore it's a

gonna put it in is going to beep

i've got a little screen over here

i don't like this big black board are one of the side

i'm gonna make a decision on the remote control functions we have forty

so we start off with the first presentation

let's close this one was used

and you to some technical problems i have and digitise the last meeting minutes make

and i'll get this one in digital form to

'kay we're going to talk about the working design

method of the remote control is electrical energy it activated

is the wilds a wide

i haven't come to your remote i've got some images of remote controls were

were not very trendy or just just a remote control like everyone knows i

or skip that part time

you don't think it's a problem to design the technical part of remote controls gonna

regardless of what type of functions we want to implement doesn't really matter

like fan of

we'll see later on

the technical functions

that i think it's very much depending on the user requirements

older be some are you comes later on once i

look it is in mind and then discuss it later on

it does what you were trying to say

butts i don't know it's really

that would they will be more clear when we come to the you know some of the new requirements

or one and also it's what's must be clear what the red button or something like that

and i don't know if there are any if you put more functions more buttons maybe it's come becoming less trendy or something like that

as i thought the with less buttons you can make a more trendy or more

control about setting be handy for and and like that i

i found some interesting things we

and three out of for users it saps all r. s. i. court of hear from the results i said buttons

per hour that's quite a lot

and an important thing here the

the most important customers which is over seventy percent of our market is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old and

so what i was thinking wrong side

because there are used very rarely and in

usually present

yes bone be very press and thank you

that was kind of what i've found

off it's impossible i think so

no i agree

so maybe we should leave all d. v. d. a v. c. r. or latest features of completely

i don't really agree action to be honest it's a very small market

but is it is a this is the fact that bigger market you're talking about we already covered at our company

at our company already cells remote control to older people but we also want you know a new customer group that's the one we haven't

the one we haven't covered yet so

is we haven't got remote control for i think

product corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in use at something

the slogan

i thought you might be let's make things better or something

sends a simplicity

presentations we know about the new project requirements

that means we can discuss on the remote control functions

if i can make start i think it's

control i think we can implement more functions then because

because the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology in their form

in their form will be a more

i think you can make some discussion the distinctions in what cut and no that just in functions you have i

i think that was it became clear you don't want

control

the but the functions are not in the remote control we're making

i have as far as possible

no requirement so you know

in a lot of t. v. d. players have some tricky settings with

but for example of v. c. r. that's a better example in this case i think

be you could to speed or a speaker sixty speed is sometimes

maybe if we just leave the d. v. d. function alima

if you want to keep it simple you can make a universal remote

it's just it's it should be something that is like a get it on your coffee table and it's just when

and it's just when you jump on the couch you pick up the remote a simple one just to put on television nothing more

but how what how will you be able to handle whole market there are

we make this one trendy and simple

user interface c. c.

i'm maybe two or three other options but not nothing more than that i think stop

but i think that becomes too difficult is not a very

i use if i read a reaction are you i use it quite often

and to and it a six is becoming out-dated we just

out-dated we just want to see what programs are all on and what time it is probably i don't know

i when you a then you look for

you look for some bow a couple weeks ago i looked at for the slides and there are a lot of slides in one page so if it is

in goes but that's kinda

page is if you have seven pages you can go up and down

using i think we should just do want the text button on it then we

button on it then we need the new requirements

we also need the other thing you use used so we

or maybe you should place them on the special way

if you grab the remote your hand should be on top plus

i think in the case of this simple remote control the technical aspects which it won't work so out already but it shouldn't be a problem then

now but we don't have to when we don't want to control other devices i think it makes it even more simple

or maybe you the batteries maybe we use large battery source for one rose

and most standard batteries

i think double a.

kind of the most what

the most ordinary batteries

more than ten minutes i think

i think about twenty minutes

but it in a way we have to be special

be just the design of the shape or some gauge it's kind of future work who was something about

them should be a like a birthday present or something if you give someone is really has something or maybe do

or maybe do should have a big a light that can flash for something on it or

i think it's very import because we gonna make such a basic remote control we have to do something to make it special it's gonna cost twenty

i think the can opener it is a brilliant idea actually because television and there is not the right combination

that has to be something special when you we

it has to you know so people wanna buy it they have to think about is more or less for a long time will really gonna use or not some

like that so it's not very important task for you and maybe

be original

or just different colours or you know i don't know if people also wanna spend more money on phones for their remote control could be

that is it different

to be you don't want to get it looks like it

incident should not look when you put it on the tape what i

if you do that but i don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half euros i have a in

this is fashionable

a in the base or we could like make up a button and if you push it the remote control it's else makes noise there's

but at s. i found here fifty percent was it fifteen

but that's fun for the first time and then the second

no all today's the the thing you put it in

and this kind of

but the put that i think it might be one day but we don't maybe you

but we'll the made we do it in taiwan and so it's not gonna be there

i think it's a great idea

so some kind of day i've never seen
