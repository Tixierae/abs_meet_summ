just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project it could have like to you by your experiences using rubber remote controls your first
i've used that these remote controls things like t. v. and the c. d. player and video recorder and
especially like i know if i'm watching t. v. i have a we separate remote controls of in front of me and one for the t. v. one for the digital box one for the video recorder as
and i think that's if we're gonna make a remote control it should actually work for what it's doing
that just has your major buttons for that work for everything you know volume control on off
i ask are we are designing a remote control for television and me

that would last longer than like double a. is
like you so you don't like having all the buttons on one remote and you don't wanna have
because that is one thing that on remotes ten to have buttons that the t. v.s no longer have as so like you have

i'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those
training so we're gonna work that whiteboard behind
various things i don't know how to work half of them
so like you have to have some work as you can we need a special
and i don't know if that works technologically on that

going to an hour now we keep combining all different remotes together and
remotes together and then on off a necessarily like that "'cause" if like to end
they seem to have a little bit of a complex over did combining all the remotes can together versus having if by different remotes so

and things like that like either some remotes that i don't know where like batteries are to war
and if if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you would need to use every day
so maybe have like one remote that has the main function of the on off channel changing volume and at the right remote with all the special things because that
that silly on them that normal remote

at we're creating a new remote control which we have three goals about it needs to be original
your first ideas about creating a new remote control would be the best
t. v. mean if it for taking it does right that's a new product a new television remote control it's not like that doesn't say
so we should maybe we should assume that it's just a television that we want to control

a normal the to the project plan to little discussion
first the functional design which will be
and i i'm the industrial designer on this project so let's see
and i'm the user interface designer for the project
it at a project finance is
but this is just a breakdown of what will be doing individually the industrial
the industrial design only now we doing on the working design

say one thing about yourself and then try your favourite animal
and then try your favourite animal what else about it
not necessarily "'cause" it's i have a solution favourite animal but is
and of time for my favourite animal

when there's like where some buttons and you have to pass to actually turn on the t. v. that you have
and many of them are going to an hour now
a bit confusing they've got too many buttons on them
and that there's not too many buttons are not too small
buttons are not too small you
all the whatever else you know programmed into it's all just in a separate place and not like all the on button see a doctor
on button see a doctor know like i mean minimum trained on

so they want you to be doing our own ideas men coming together
i have no idea how one would explain
moving on to slightly more serious
and one thing i particularly like is if you're not street moving it around to get it to work with the infrared
it's an idea of the buttons been a
sounds like we've had a good little session for our first ideas mind if
ideas mind if we move on
so we continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like
the user interface designer that's real that's technical functions i like keeping in mind the buttons thing the size of the buttons on the user requirements

it's quite care your home around or you go
around d. c. h. sort of anywhere
i agree with having too many remotes around my
remotes around my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things i
i'm as each get around instructions and then

about it needs to be original trendy and user-friendly i'm
to carry everything they need with
doesn't have all the buttons that you need to programme the video recorder or
recorder or programme it's other things that i'm not a coherent about that just has
as you can we need a special functions occasionally
i mean i suppose it would be to have a play in the court and stop buttons on the t. v. d. recorder as and i

said i have a powerpoint presentation for us for the kick-off meeting my
which will be on for so do individual work into a meeting
into a meeting conceptual
conceptual design individual work and a meeting and then the
and then the detailed design individual work and a meeting so they want you to
what we're gonna be discussing and the next meeting the banana
and then because what we're gonna do is first are individual actions and then we'll come back
so that's lovely meeting

animal but is that i think the trouble
that it's fun and interesting animal
and we're gonna keep keep see sort of thing going on that animal
a so very excited to see all your animals and

my name is rose and then i'll be the project manager
i'll be the project manager
i'm rose and project manager from california
