i don't think any this room in the fifties
as like a crank thing or something
wouldn't be very fancy
i'm not about buying do was really but
or titanium and for each of them you have the cases where for example titanium you call use it's foal if you if we choosing a double curved case we can choose titanium and if we choosing
so i think we discussed earlier on the or at s. r. i. problem things so we could
but they've used in the rubber but then
squeezable remote
i live there
so rubber would be
rubber we'll go we'll like that idea you think you can market
or we live rubber
people
so let's not let's send a follow with it on print
so it's either the scroll wheel all the pushbuttons
pushbuttons

don't know these hopes solar panel things so that's where from the sound or can they were from a light bulb
so we've got to discuss about
for the case of the remote itself and they can be a general case which is just a flat one you can have
you can have a curved one or double curved one if you
and if we choosing a solar cells then we can choose latex for the case material so we just have
but if we choosing just the flat case then we can go for it thing so
you think you can market that
after my fast and i think to realise the rubber is more
or you could have l. c. d. which gives you a display
i think pushbuttons is
as just unclips the you record yourself so you can
alright that's me done
that i think that would actually be worse for something like r. s. i mean you get that some of
i mean you get that some of my data constantly going
some sort of you will have a lot but my connection or a cover or something like that i
most important aspect is not and feel so that

as a kind of spam and everybody likes to see
i first for just we get from our last meeting
and and you guys are just be enough this some r. and d. for that's
the noses need to those terms of this right
scroll buttons as
so if you use a rabbit double curved case you must use rubber push buttons so if
channel five and a chance like talk
we got we would with the latex but the r. s. i. e. probably
so we've already address that i think
you would the television right i was just trying to find
whether it's a battery it could

but aspect of a euro
in the wheel and like that and
so you can have basic push buttons or scroll wheels like to have on a mouse
it's less expensive than
technically speaking it's know as advanced but that's a job to
channel two
but the fact that this rubber it is actually used in these anti r. s. a way to specific
the other rubber's good
so what waterford decisions on the same as saying the
i'd say maybe a couple of colours like like a black with yellow line somewhere like maybe the r. r.

that's research and development that that before the noses
no but now that we see in the the energy that's one thing
i love a big mac place
i agree
we're giving them a way to burn off steam
it's just a sample sensor sample output i just
they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an m. p. three player like ipod
play phone some way or something for the elderly where the remote very large and the buttons are very large and there's only few buttons but
but i think we are really keeping to what is already out there and people already seen it people already got it if we want something new
was spongy that's why we got

but then the case material itself so it can be it a plastic or latex or rubber wood or titanium and
we gonna go we were working with the there's gonna be a rubber case so
what about that just to know the sample sensor
but the speech recognition and option is that it doesn't seem really very promising for us "'cause"
the the example that they are they using it for is with the coffee machine where
even if it's a joke will it still repetitive
he's seeing still get you tell you still get repetitive strain injury when you're pressing a button or pressing a flat the screen it's
know colours so secure gimmicky bits to it we not we just gonna
be i mean i can speak with the button department that i think that
is not fancy and it's different but i wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy if

but it's not like from our last meeting we really wanna something that was general but so
we get out of work and we did we decided
all this is being used for is a television
if we want something new we need to move away from what we already have
we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the generating like the energy generator
that's right done
third most important aspect it is it's easy to use and i think we've all
that's in a fashion not supposed to look text
not supposed to look text it's fast and a very much in fruit and vegetables of them are like they have theme for cloths shoes and furniture so

or double curved one
so we just have to take that into account but
and also it doesn't break of this easily maybe i dunno
and the other pushbuttons so
so it's a constraint
it i'm just guessing but it's gonna be the most expensive option probably in
and this is all time you buy nicely the fact

i'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go then why do
if we get a scroll-wheel that's a higher price range if we get an
interface i we you know that idea it's
that i that's the point where we need to decide about that
no wood
and a little tight as you say but not too much
that's why we got that's where i had a big and

we could have a lot of colours the keys might be you know funny or play phone some
and think the spinning wheel with the l. c. display or crucial for us and
we're gonna supplement it with anything you know colours so
that's why thinking bluetooth "'cause" it's flat put
'cause it's flat put a blue to use them as a bluetooth remote control and it's got like a because
but if wood for example and apply i think see connect for example you if you get a call on your mobile phone but you more mobile phone is downstairs is something you would get on this solution you been called by this person right now
no that would be a telephone thinking them in your television

i mean like what's the point of saying yellow remote i mean will help for her really
it's just a remote that talks to
that talks to and it's certain cues
but anything's gonna have buttons
i think it should be more general and
and then you can market it never

were interested in and something more general but
more general but they suggested you know going a little bit into it and it should like you are doing
should like you are doing a remote put skates we could have a
you don't want you want people to build a quickly access the buttons that they use lot without was pressing along one and i didn't mention
this is an example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose and for
so was against the speech recognition and against going a pretty new thing in each sense i think it should be more general

it was we got together to sit decide on to talk about what is that we were actually supposed to be doing in
because channel two
it they it be but they saying that just developed it i'm just guessing but
so is the same was so straight set of buttons
that would be the remote so much i mean

rubber or not but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material so
so if we've chosen role rubber and if now we have the choice for the case where there it's flat single curved or double curved i'm just saying
as go crazy and
and then to have a last slide
that forget about it are

i can give you an example here of a good way and that layout
from are manufacturing department so this would
it's sort of confusing for the user
and for something for kids
and i think my personal preferences if we've all kind of talked about and seem to be on the same page

have to say like madonna with one of these on
with a plan for
i dunno any other questions on this
if that's what people want then we here we go in the right direction and it's

you have any preference of order
i think it has to be only solar energy but i don't know
what alternatives do we have to the chip on print
cheap cheerful it's worked doesn't work

no it's fine i'm just
he what alternatives
or whatever responding you program the response as as just unclips
change the batteries ever again

let's have a pushbutton
be so that's just the electronics between that behind the pushbuttons
to it can i have ten of power i have all that forget
stand out you sign or here in your research and they do have they are they would and they complain about our story and this is anti r. s. i.

if we get an advanced chip which is used for the l. c. d. the display thing then that's even more expensive
chip on print right
all of them not understanding
what alternatives do we have to that

so i had consulted with our manufacturing division sunday like
like it doesn't have to be you know bluetooth that was just an
rubber
what's find out what channel

idea it's pointless
the other suggestion and i
nine
but the docking

and i didn't mention we need a power button one or a last i can give you an example
why should we will buy this one level you got a remote that kind of that serious
technologically it should be like work i it should work
we should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense i mean

settings it should be technologically innovative so
of got away from "'cause" i rubber one is not fancy and
what i've done so what
market it never have to change the battery again

in some sense i mean have something that's little more technologically advanced and what's on the market
now it probably is we've already decided that we're going with the that work's already this cheap
x. m. in this first two points we've already sort of got away from "'cause"
i think safety is

a because bluetooth is the in thing nowadays like really think like people
for the don't really care whether you know the end of the day whether it works properly or not
it there but it's flat it's not
good if it looks good and it sickens the speed of decoration

you three though presentations whether they be on
we wanna go for and it all it's a long as it works
it's a long as it works

would like to hear about is if we finally decided on or so then g. were gonna be using and
if you remote like channel which
it the the interface type would for

a hand dynamo which is which was use in the fifties for torches if you remote
like channel which wouldn't be that wouldn't be of
it's double i mean isn't a rubber case mean it's completely fact i mean it fax just whatever they want it to this was

and if we want something fancy i think the kinetic provision of energy could be
it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the t. v. like turn the t. v. on and it turns on but it's not that it's just
it disk is a non so

rubber the whole way
and so i press of all what i'm saying like move away from the current remote controls that like the look-and-feel of the car ones and change the look and feel whole still
i don't know how we incorporate

the sample sensor sample speaker thing
we were in the speaker for the remote control unit
feel so that what contrast the look-and-feel fancier than the ones that already the we already have so

i thought it was when they said
i was just trying to find an advantage what
what advantage would you get for the

i also to irises marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration "'cause" i think that's
'cause i think that's crucial as far as what keys we're going to include what buttons we're going to include in another laid out so the manufacturing
so is the advantage of bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other

which we've already probably discussed
so next eight people would we put if i
i found if i think in

but if you hold on a minute
i think it with this band thing if the company it to in

aspect of a euro with it
wouldn't be very fancy you can have a

i think she's to finishing
if it's it's inside the unit it doesn't affect whether the customers gonna buy it or not

you can have a kinetic provision of energy which
so if you have just a bit of ten to movement that it won't give it the energy to work all you can

but there's sometimes combinations i mean i calculators too combinations of battery with that also using some solar power
people and

by the t. v. programmes got one navy of watching
navy of watching imagine that we obtain just lost again "'cause" it costs very little panels off the wall

so if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case
and if we choose double curve then we have to go for rubber push buttons so it's

if it's a double curved we've gotta go for rubber push buttons
if it's rubber as an indelible anyways i mean it doesn't matter if

push buttons instead of the wheel
anyways i mean it doesn't matter if it's double i mean

this was the difference between a normal rubber case rubble double rubber double curved case
so they also get the they suggested

go then why do we need to go for rubber push buttons
i dunno we just need to decide on the case

so the pushbuttons and sell it can be just simple they can be so that's
no vegetables

just if you really lonely maybe
maybe the kinetic will provision of energy than it's been done for

i'm fine with the basic battery
basic battery cheap

than the case do you want it to facts or curved or single or double curved
i thought they would give an option of flat buttons or

so we wanna rubber double curved
it seems that we would wanna make it too busy into a sort of daddy but

the double probably is
i'm just let me know what's happening in be more tapes

so then if we use double curved case then we have to you she used rubber push buttons that's fine
so rubber keys

we going for the simple buttons
that's right using the spongy rubber the ritual about that

it sounds kind of funky and we can
a one i suppose and i still first thing you go i wanna buy that gotta love it works or not

i i t. v. can be stressful if you're watching sports
that's what allows you to do it

so the manufacturing division sent some samples of interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products like the coffee machine
another we decide are

so this would be an example of bad where
about that anti r. s. i. and as you squeeze it you know i mean if every piece is a rising yourself you are charging the batteries and

so it's just gonna be just me pushbuttons
i think we should have a limited number of buttons ideally i mean it like

ideally i mean it like power channel up channel down volume up volume down the numerical keep that
that would mean we have to make a television as

and also a recent investigation that we've done in remote control market we have found that
no but if you get bluetooth on the remote should be able to

bluetooth that was just an idea but like
a lot better on all images of apples

so we can have to use that or like a broccoli key in the another kind key
the power button could be like a big apple or something

i've heard about it back again can that

back again can that wonderful making it's

it's everyone ready but

almost

and get them overnight is kind of what's going on

what we're gonna talk that in this meeting is

we know what it is a with their in their we know that it's a t. v. remote and and

whether they be on computer or on the white board or whatever you want

or i'd like to hear this is on the from casting actually first or

this is tiffany first

would that work

so from position

so what for the energy sources we can have an a basic battery a hand

of energy which is used on some watches these days so if you have

all you can new solar cells i'm

thank them very or cost or less would be the basic that's really and

could be i don't know if it's worth the cost so we've

you know kind of more way gonna make that kind of sits that paul the hands like kind of thing

i think rabbits

but is it the double curved one or not if it's

if it's not double curve then we've got the choice for the pushbuttons if it's a double

of all double

then you have the case is whether it's flat a curved and

that's we don't care if it's from rubber or not but

slide side a so

and the price but there was it with it so the simple

with it so the simple push buttons are gonna be the cheapest if we

is that advanced chip on print which up "'cause" it was one b. c. and that's got all the electronics one board including the infrared sender

if it's not chip on print and i you get defend chip components and you build them separately and doesn't include infrared it's less expensive

it's not so we wanna go into with this product

where you can programme a sample that but when you say something or whatever responding you

so you can programme a coffee maker that when you say good morning to it says hello red or whatever but i mean

'cause you have changed gives you a verbal response so i mean

i thought one i said voice recognition them and like channel five and a

channel five and then switched on

no doubt that would be more promising it

chance like talk to it can i

so i'll go back maybe to see the previous slide and we can decide

and we can decide for each problem what we should choose so for the energy

so for the energy source to be go for the battery all day

so we go for that rainy

so look like something like this

and it's cheap it's still round it sounds kind

and we can also market it as

also market it as it "'cause" we're is it stand out you sign

so that's another of marketing point or we can use

the rubber push button so but you have to move your

it's the fact that you're pressing the same doing the same movement it's not actually

so they can sit there and like

not that watching t. v. should be that stressful

and you know you can for the across the room and try to thirty children

gabriel there's some that's a free about the it's the interface

some what i have to say it ties into like after was just talking about

in some continuing with the user interface topic

sunday like captain was also speaking with them

so i already mentioned speech recognition interface i

i just be probably the most expensive part of a remote without any actual interesting functionality is for is operating the t. v.

and i have a feeling that

but we can discuss this but it's not like

so the key layout and design a really crucial you don't want you

where you have volume up and volume down but they have a v. on both of them so

do we have an a number of a good one

so we're gonna have any sort of display i think so

and without we get

we did we decided when do

daddy but

like maybe the r. can be yellow or something like that

i the fact also that we are having a rubber case prevent us from having that cover functional we thought of before i mean "'cause"

before i mean "'cause" that's so if we wanna have a lot of some sort of have to be a button but i think that should

that i think that should be easy to have a button it just prevents the other buttons from operating so it should be

the button that this does that

and what fast as a for next year

so from looking at this trends and fashions and also

we have found that for a remote control market these are like most important aspects that we really need to which we've already probably

direction and it's not technologically innovative either

or wavy we cared so

and when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for the don't really care

but it looks good if it looks

and then this is just gonna keep all this is being used for

but i mean people like

it would be that would mean you'd need a television that has bluetooth in it which not no television does

if you're looking at you see looking at something that's going to bolt by people you have to make it you have to make it state of the art

nah to tell of it the television would have to be a play to use compatible at and there

idea but like it needs to something that you know is new whether

and just go creative

it's been done for watches of a problem see and that for remote yet

the fact that is why that this rubber with infrared about do we should

do we should think with people so they remote controls about because it charges itself up quite a bit

but but this place in it they

in a scroll be shaped if

rubber i think

and as but the feel what you've been we see a spongy so it's

so it's not quite spongy i would say this

and feel whole still keeping to the companies and it's like

so we're moving right direction

we've got my gonna go back to come in the knesset thing that's right using

and i'm not about the buttons think in the shape for that

we have to follow every trend i

maybe make it like fruity colours or something

but apple would say you for that
