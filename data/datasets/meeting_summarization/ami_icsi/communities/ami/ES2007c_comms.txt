go then why do we need to go for rubber push buttons
the rubber push button so but you have to move your

but then the case material itself so it can be it a plastic or latex or rubber wood or titanium and
so if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case
we gonna go we were working with the there's gonna be a rubber case so
it's double i mean isn't a rubber case mean it's completely fact i mean it fax just whatever they want it to this was
rubber or not but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material so
it's rubber casing the week and sellers from and funky don't have any other

rubber we'll go we'll like that idea you think you can market
after my fast and i think to realise the rubber is more
or we live rubber
if it's rubber as an indelible anyways i mean it doesn't matter if
that's we don't care if it's from rubber or not but
rubber the whole way
so rubber keys
that's right using the spongy rubber the ritual about that
i think if it's rubber it needs to be

so if you use a rabbit double curved case you must use rubber push buttons so if
and if we choose double curve then we have to go for rubber push buttons so it's
if it's a double curved we've gotta go for rubber push buttons
so then if we use double curved case then we have to you she used rubber push buttons that's fine

but they've used in the rubber but then
but the fact that this rubber it is actually used in these anti r. s. a way to specific
i the fact also that we are having a rubber case prevent us from having that cover functional we thought of before i mean "'cause"
the fact that is why that this rubber with infrared about do we should

of got away from "'cause" i rubber one is not fancy and
is not fancy and it's different but i wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy if

a hand dynamo which is which was use in the fifties for torches if you remote
if you remote like channel which
squeezable remote
i mean like what's the point of saying yellow remote i mean will help for her really
it's just a remote that talks to
should like you are doing a remote put skates we could have a
this is an example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose and for
why should we will buy this one level you got a remote that kind of that serious
no but if you get bluetooth on the remote should be able to

for the case of the remote itself and they can be a general case which is just a flat one you can have
or titanium and for each of them you have the cases where for example titanium you call use it's foal if you if we choosing a double curved case we can choose titanium and if we choosing
and if we choosing a solar cells then we can choose latex for the case material so we just have
but if we choosing just the flat case then we can go for it thing so
then you have the case is whether it's flat a curved and
i dunno we just need to decide on the case

with it so the simple push buttons are gonna be the cheapest if we
we going for the simple buttons

really different colours i
or make a different colours so that anybody can see like
so what do you say maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do that

we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the generating like the energy generator

we wanna go for and it all it's a long as it works
it's a long as it works

scroll buttons as
in a scroll be shaped if
and i'm not about the buttons think in the shape for that

you can have a curved one or double curved one if you
or double curved one
but is it the double curved one or not if it's
if it's not double curve then we've got the choice for the pushbuttons if it's a double
so if we've chosen role rubber and if now we have the choice for the case where there it's flat single curved or double curved i'm just saying
i'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go then why do
than the case do you want it to facts or curved or single or double curved
so we wanna rubber double curved

we were in the speaker for the remote control unit
we have found that for a remote control market these are like most important aspects that we really need to which we've already probably
yes the remote control to mark time
i think specially maybe younger "'cause" it's in pink the pack a remote control for the room so
don't have any other remote controls are the main this do you know you
do you know you were saying how standard gives you repetitive strain injury this remote control is designs to the complete opposite
