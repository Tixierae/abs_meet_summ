other people would require and teletext in a remote teletext option remote control
those people most of teams and people they find that the remote control so for know somewhere in the remote in the home but

and the second thing some some companies that thing that they show them what are more functions of the users in their remote controls but rather than
as can see that the remote control have parts and the sports book like that and
we could do then would be you have a remote control by the t. v. speaker and i'm
that comes with our remote control
right and then the remote control know what's been produced by the television
that could also be built since the t. v. there which might make a remote control of the obsolete
and it kinda feels a bit different from a lot of remote controls the rubber
my reaction turn all yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than or so i think just having

think so this way to not only gonna do the cost of all of remote controls but in this what profit also so we have to take
art look or the market ancient art of how we should design can do other remote controls forty should be there so as to in a house of the profit in have solar cells these
to and we want in a company designing remote controls if we cannot they were so

contrast control
my scenario controller

they find that the five percent to thirty four percent of the country where they find too difficult to operate a remote control so it
so it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we
and you know to have any much technical know let's do see at the mall how to operate these remote controls but is it

take that back
like it takes back the r. f. remote sort of ideas that

speech recognition
so and as we talk about speech recognition and whistling and
as that this which is on the speech recognition is entirely speech operate user
speech recognition potentially flat screen
speech recognition i take it
have the north know products than that you speech recognition whale
and the text to speech recognition she
i think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition is a bit of a
was speech recognition

and what they've got first define that if you a word there were problems they're having the current remote control so available in the market seventy five percent
seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote control so available in the market are really they're not so
i even in the market "'cause" for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros which maybe which may
it will look at this that how how but the problems of the balloon was are facing the existing remote controls in the market they find
remote controls and we should provide close by problem and no suffice to use also so as that they would go there was could easily lead and you know
if it if you can build spacecraft you'll have no problem of the remote control
that and that will activate the remote control starts to be two five

if we look at the course whether the consumers they're willing to have pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not we can find that came up to a thirty five years is a joke we have a very good disliking for this this for a blind like for speech recognition in a remote control so we can
and a novel feature which which is brought up with this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection future for when you lose your remote like people
where do we add speech recognition as as the glow in the dark and ball these factors will have the locating the remote control like if they
there was the remote control they cannot to use go they had a some basic speech recognition on it you could program

like if they come down speak something of the remote control it applies to something and it glows in the dark about this sectors of
'cause you had out more than finding it that was more like in a few watching a fill in the dark you can still see the remote control

it was function f. eight
i think a function f. eight
function f. eight
smartkom function f. eight
function f. eight
it is that a function we want in the remote
function f. five
function f. eight for the

your remote like people microphone on it and any noise
so people to like although

yes i have to look or are they market potential for this product and make
in setting is really very important point it's if we look at the market those people

to use it to leaving remote control to the mail in a big grey
important because t. f. t. of just released i think is it at a remote control for presentations so and a big seven inch big screen anyway so

that also kind of take set the speech recognition in terms of the interference and not working very and things like that so
i thought was up the material is maybe not this kind of a tail maybe more like this kind of work for a materials to bit more
