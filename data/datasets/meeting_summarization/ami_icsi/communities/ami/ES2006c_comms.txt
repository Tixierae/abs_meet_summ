rubber buttons but then
and the buttons are also rubber we have in push buttons
we have in push buttons on the outside and

this is the outside of the remote right if you
and charging the remote
we can have pushbuttons like most remotes do and
so do we need an c. d. on the remote
and you put the number in the remote and then you
the remote and then you in any case the t.
but we still need to think about the colour of a remote as such you know just keep black or

wheel but i have like we seem ipods not made of rubber rather
you'd maybe call you mean like if you modelling a lot of what you've got five buttons and a wheel and for
and for the buttons are in the wheel and

no i think it's just a casing rubber on the outside
should we go if we're going for rubber or we think are on as our case and then

and so it i mean if the case you have the case and it becomes a big bulky one
i mean the case would be the case would be
rubber rather than what the case the top of it and i can change

there are different cases are in that can be provided they
be the case would be rather than that the buttons
and the colours can be provided with the case rather than

looking at what we've got watch we want an l. c. d. display with the spinning wheel
but i'm not completely and completely clear i about the spinning wheel so i think
but you spinning wheel tends to go to one side
'cause i'm a bit like we came back type of the again room the whole spinning wheel but i have like
i think the spinning wheels definitely very now
and then on the inside an l. c. d. with spinning wheel or incorporating
so it in or what do we have the spinning wheel inside with the l. c. d. would it be on the l. to
and then you open up and you go screen and spinning wheel which you can incorporate buttons and see

and you mean this would be like b. d. or a shape of the remote control
on set for example you can pick up the remote control and say you something to it like l. a. and
there is i think there's no reason why we can do something like this for the remote control
or like a minimalist remote controls
remote controls you were you buttons want to ninety on and off anybody one that and
because i mean if you think most people use a remote control with a white and that way and see you wanna
as we as you get make a an electric shock a few remote control if it was made for
obvious c.s or if a table but for a remote control
in that case a remote control not really

than the wheel but you've got a lot less control over

so to have the standards a major buttons like on off the channels and then volume and
so the in the buttons we have all the channels also we have options do it

so you can have a lot what looks like a normal remote control unit or like a minimalist
but for a remote control unit

and they have they can even have an integrated the push button inside the scrolling think the scroll
is another new development is the scroll button which
said i mean this is also one of them give new developments as we might consider if we wanted to include
no the scroll button is a different think i have a picture
and actually i quite like the idea of a scroll the scrolling button i thought
the scrolling button i thought it could be for voice like i dunno it in like i like it used to be an walkmans or something there is

i thought i'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do
for twenty or so these are the different options that we have
but anyway so the other different options that we have

like so you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place under p. c. b. and
and the on pressing this button
so i'm guessing that the sample speaker is probably something like and you know as soon as you press a button it now that gives you feed that one five or whatever on
this one because it's the smallest and with least with us most number of buttons as one and i
button which was also there are also already mentioned and
myself but i think it's just like it's a way it's like not separate buttons like this one
so the buttons definitely in fact

we need a regular or advanced for a scroll wheels
so that means we need an advanced thing
we need the advanced
