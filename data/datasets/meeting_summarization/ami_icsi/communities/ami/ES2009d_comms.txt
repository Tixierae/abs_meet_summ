this is very high powered it to look like a
is true and again i gotta look at that way to end of it
first looked into a lot
it looks with fashion or
paper and so what my handwriting looks like the it has because my handwriting
i mean this it looks like in p. d. f. format or something
like this is what that looked like literally just like that
if we for years always looked so more complicated
i thought it was david burns looking the eyeball that's what

and we're we will look at the prototype and
at the u. i. d. in the i. d. were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype press a look at sell

into the game but it looks like at this point that maybe at a bar we need
so i this is the point where we go i would of roll it looks like and talk

the right time kind of thought and the gaps enough the same time
the same time we have enough room to kind of just make things that just

and you know just tentatively put in what it's going to look like it's gonna clear this
it's gonna clear this out we'll quickly but it looks like

with the back of battery
or take out the back up battery
i mean we could take we take the battery at it you see any probably work

fair enough
a that looks like to be v. or a fair so that
because if you don't if i wanna say fair enough
say fair enough

i don't know on a certain new ideas found that is about
new ideas

you know perhaps when this technology comes down price we can bring that back into the game but it looks
and overall in general it looks like it's coming up to par the
data look like it was coming up rough but then once

but it's actually can slide back and
slide back and for it's very a static one it's a put away

what kind of a risk would be looking at what some of the various bridges we're discussing and we essentially

if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel so
you can see if you touch it does have a squishy feel
we need to use the things that look like we feel are important
they like that spongy feel
but you guys feel about the process
only mean like we also then you were we were headed with it so it didn't feel

plus a possible new product
to put this into production working abouts
and even then we did get a decent product or no although
function which is what the whole product was about
but i feel like if this was a team production would've been much more of the cleverer like brainstorming use the board
know how our product for a fair i can

it's a speaker in a sense at the same time isn't it
at a time it just it made more sense but i could see

so that will work way with regard to find in this contraption
that in the factory a kid we could very easily put it on it works
it works in a place such that it's pretty permit
is working what am i gonna do people groups
the house of but for now what we've got is working in the range we enforce i'll
by one chris's i was that we did happen of course to work with right
the rest of us some structure work with so i
the only i like as a team work at all
way to say i was at the cost worked really within budget but we could
