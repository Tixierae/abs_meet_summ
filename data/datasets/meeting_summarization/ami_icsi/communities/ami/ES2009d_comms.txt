and we're we will look at the prototype and
got my coat a cemetery you need some supposed
otherwise it's just saying and the secretary and
because you can really use it as remotes as you could use
go ahead and take away yes
it's a couple years off at least
the voice recognition actually doubles as as the solar cell or
in the case it's more of a single curved case i
i think that's a good compromise you got four it's a
it looks like
but because of form constraints doesn't really matter
organic rid of it
including is there more to the colour way or another
i know it could amazing
but yes think about the new roles
it's fun kind of fun it was
she said it's g. action in
for some other than anything like the project manager in a c. or as crap
this would be in six months worth of work not like three dollars would be the eighties
"'cause" i'm conscious
'cause i'm conscious of the idea of the project manager asking you have you guys feel like as a team that's a kind of like a are you
that is kind of
interesting
minus the mikes and
minus the mikes and feel like getting up and down to avoid wires i was afraid of break something
loose and he said we get up it's a possibility or tripping over something or contain cold or

so it's quite please with that one thing that we didn't
but the voice recognition that incorporates the latest designs are they researching this you know the couple come up with
we also continue down with the ideas that following a apples colour schemes with a kind of the later or and trends green or
it's not quite faceplate it's more like a
i think the long run it's better to keep the battery it's hard to scrap
here and maybe move ahead with the project without the solar cell
that'd be grey
i do we do that on purpose either be
i was just evaluating from what we know of our product for t. may now with the criteria that we said the beginning of these are things
of these are things we need to use the
data look like it was coming up rough but then once
do here we were trying on that one
it's i think eventually if we do brainchild is partly we do have a higher better option than
we could do you ever want in till that but you came down on us
my they had was it always a plus
i think recap that are really creative actually i mean
it's proven we were wasteful we didn't we single bit of play doh we use
all for that we can take it
i think it's pretty clever "'cause"
it's pretty clever "'cause" we're never able to get too far off track because
the right time kind of thought and the gaps enough the same time
those are the first time at a canonical a row

that we so those are the most important buttons and then
you can see that there are lots of things going on but it's actually can
it's a spreadsheet of the parts and you know just
and you know just tentatively put in what it's going to look like it's gonna clear this
see a that looks like to be
moving along swiftly so
it are technologies up to where we hope they would be and is a fully
it looks like it's going also
and the paging function works that's good
this one's a bit and clear to me to be perfectly fair pick up the slide
or no although it's not everything we wanted it to be
with the natural
very natural
it's a natural
when i was reporting about what each of us to seeing as often confused as to what you're doing

it is powerpoint time
at the more powerpoints in this particular experiment then i've ever done in my life for this experiment it's kind of
what's we said about it
that's some option we you get very
i is a look at throw wood material or rubbery tight material that throughout
special and so i
i would think as an control
any probably work ninety nine percent of time but you have
doesn't respond the voice recognition and overall
and overall in general it looks like it's coming up to par the
and even then we did get a decent product or no although
lacking but then you know fill in the blanks on your own for creativity up to whatever

this is going to be the on off button and then we have
it here for a week are fruity if you're
you change one that i think it would be desirable for the for the regular product in the in the first packaging could be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind
i don't know if you guys have any questions or
crap know so maybe we get to push button interface is that
in reality as you know for me from an ideological sense but i don't like to stick with the the solar cell but
which i will i'll send it to cover
i mean right barely anything
i think they're seeking notes more often than usual is
track because the information came at the right time
know but i would have but i know that it consciously didn't
i mean it's just like the paper i don't know what i really need the paper for

what kind of a risk would be looking at what some of the various bridges we're discussing and we essentially
either have a clean on remote like shape because you can
no we haven't talked but they have a
actually this bottom or red green here just on clips and then you put
i we do have we pray start a spongy even spongy or non actual work materials which
materials which i think we're go find we also continue
and we could go the faceplate life you know there any
and highly resourceful teammates my they had was
true i got a spreadsheet
nothing i mean again you know like

we have a sample our prototype what's
i have a sense that so if the future
was our coast
you get very to start
she's making use the same space and send that is but
if at the moment correctly
we might be all this way beyond idea that we are main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing i mean that's
a that looks like to be v. or a fair so that
would be it to me to change but
that if you like me the level information dropped off severely over the course of the day

all set
secretary and they're from taking minutes so just
to go or or just real briefly go over minutes from last meeting
so the most important things to consider or that it's we decided not to go for a touch screen which can say
we have these points to go through the channels
i mean the solar cell is a big piece of the way were marking this is like a natural new i think no but
no we change
they'll be need
i do mystery is that we used to it i mean as soon as we got the play that i think you know the whole concept are really try to stick with the only one out there isn't it

it's kind of
i don't know otherwise it's
you know it uses were operating under what kind
and we essentially in the conclusion that we should develop a remote with their voice recognition either
remotes as you could use a voice that would include some
always just a simple remote and
and special
they like that spongy feel

this is very high powered it to look like a
so it's very durable it's like an a
it's actually important to know that the television you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that the it actually is edible inside
if you notice but i wrote the the company's name that opens that's
this is actually an apple on the inside this
the troubles i was just given this by fine it's it's a spreadsheet
come in at sixteen
hindsight a lock a remote is working what

and then pretty more advanced functions there's a slider panel here
of course if that's annoying for some people function can be turned off
have any questions or what is that whether we need to worry about any either marketing areas or anything of that nature did
i mean we could take we take the battery at it you see any probably work
that's what setting us into this young market
so i was looking at a basic design things does it fulfil its function
does it fulfil its function as a remote is the design
does that had to get people are in here is

appropriate
and i think if we shopped around from other manufacturers we might be able to give you can cheaper
it's gonna clear this out we'll quickly but it looks like
but it looks like
curved case i to be that the general
seems like we have to go back to
of reproductive considering the little amount of input we had going and and the
we didn't use the whiteboard

the only thing is with the poll up here all day is to take some adjusting because in user
no old know whiteboard
i think your leadership was gonna get
it's g. action in common of a w. getting
in the centre with that is true and again
a c. or as crap it's one thing to do you know
it's one thing to do you know set up a party with your friends you know
but you can stop it you can keep be i suspect and disbelief kind of like the raw wanna look at

what other things we see here if you give it a touch
because it simple enough that in the
that in the factory a kid we could very easily put it on it works
is working what am i gonna do people groups
function which is what the whole product was about
i think at there should be more serious tell you whether brainstorm were growing or meetings as a team

to look like a very go
it's like an a break like sometimes a plastic straps
and at this point about losing the solar panel but
and i am disappointed
what if you response or three months from now happy we

but this is kind of something that can be done and
this young market mean that so we started from so
we can get rid of the i mean removing the changing
connected to so i we are going to discuss project process and that is going
i feel like that was slightly lacking but then

so that will work way with regard to find in this contraption
a entire thing is covered and rubber coating so it's very
although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental i
that's kind of thing though you know
first looked into a lot

as you scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons but we just went for a classic
we've got this it's a solar cell thing right
what's difficult we have all these things integral to the to the design of it that we just can't back out of now i would have to be
you know i think in general
than usual is i like that and

it and i think that i was given a proven ease of use and whatnot and
and allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user so
it's a speaker in a sense at the same time isn't it
she's making
and i think that i think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move

but with a slider for that day for more advanced functions for users and
at the u. i. d. in the i. d. were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype press a look at sell
for a "'cause" if we have that there's no we could got a lot done in time
are you having the format itself out a lot

that's sort of like the main
like the main me here
so i think there's a lot of room for creativity we could do you
the only i like as a team work at all

great of course that's that you change one that
i mean i think that if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features being incremental and without that is in one although
although it does still have the battery so i'm not that
you mean it like that's you know if it was like this or like make a remote

and i think it's nicely designed into the overall have to but
of twelve fifty
cord
you reach that would be great think

just ten year really
that mean you've got the five in a
we just if we can just itemise
with the back of battery

slide back and for it's very a static one it's a put away
nature did we come in under budget
that would be kinda creepy

and as you can see on the television there now we have
that's sort of the moment right
and then you put a new and you've played on top of that so i mean

clearly there's gonna be some more colours and one on available
did you have anything else to add to that
worry about the materials it is

what we need to discuss now is to find it so that might that mean
clever then so i that would
alright so our agreement on that

one big curve stick to
you know the rest of us some structure
the rest of us some structure work with so i

and so i you have to mark special colour special forms when she
is it is very unconventional i would think
into the game but it looks like at this point that maybe at a bar we need

i'll tell that
but and then in the end i think i got an m. l. that a little bit more which is fine
fine i think the most helpful thing i do that everything was getting the powerpoint slides are they put together for a "'cause" if

it's single
was pretty textile

right so i finally
i finally figured out what this whole second board point is about them i got my coat a cemetery

as you know it uses
sell

we take into account lot of things that we went over
lot of things that we went over and the last meeting so the most

and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural it here
now we have the voice detector device on the top there

if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel so
i think that will work with regards to our market

opens that's a this is actually
so i'm not that you know what the cell is on that

plus a possible new product
we could now if you had time for that really

to put this into production working abouts
see a lot artists we have a choice with the buttons as you scroll

but we just went for a classic rubber button and
that we do have to use as many microchips which is quite

quite so what are the coffee maker design that we're talking about it and
we've got our rubber ski and material threw out

do we know we stay in on that
we didn't quite have enough material

it works in a place such that it's pretty permit
the same time if we wanna go the other way is just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go

the five in a number that actually sounds
number that actually sounds quite

right so we will it touch on that but it
but you guys feel about the process

it's hard to scrap the whole solar battery idea "'cause" that's
battery idea "'cause" that's sound terrible to the thing that we have

square one in a way
no we change in the case materials

so we were gonna get blow calls and
and is a fully ecstatic all these that are we market research was looking for basic

'cause we can remove the pushbuttons "'cause" they are
he kind of

up rough but then once you get used to it does make a sense so i think overall
so i think overall we're having the right direction

it's i think eventually
so i this is the point where we go i would of roll it looks like and talk

panel but it's
we made of are we might have lost like green or make it again but we are

like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and
and then i also felt like you know a lot of our discussion with sent around the specifically what my task as because

and so forth and have an orc i
as in within the team or

so it's just kind of an open mike kind of thing
and they're starting blocks

i think i'm the screen at that experience
say fair enough

and the technology is to have we been hope it's really
been hope it's really interesting the trial this new

it attempts to contact coach i did
what kind of coaching is that really whatever really

by one chris's i was that we did happen of course to work with right
you could it all multiple

you could it all multiple skins really have you had more colours
the same time we have enough room to kind of just make things that just

or speech chip which is of speech it like this together
that's it "'cause" the mikes are loose and

interesting to fasten it was a
fasten it was a criminal process

to sell at here we have our detailed

here we have our detailed design meeting and we're we will

you need some supposed to read the minutes from previous meeting

we'll open the slowly no for it

the more the start from a last minute last meeting was that we that we had meetings from that we had presentations them by the industrial designer will from a friend there on the kind of sarah about what we can do here

and white sort of limitations were operating with as

that would include some mostly just a simple design features for television operation but with

and a p. for some very large buttons for the primary functions

the channels them into volume buttons down here that we so those are the

but it's actually can slide back and

it's four is the for the small white thing we decided to go with that multiple colours coming out why not

fair enough

perfect

it's important to be we talked

to be we talked a quite a bit about you know that they interchangeable faces and what we've

the materials it is a

you can see if you touch it does have a squishy feel

do we need to worry about brought factors

but i think a sedan new to

do we go to have ourselves a know we're not talking about

a know we're not talking about making televisions this point or anything like that but

but i think that's i think that sums up the main features of of the remote i don't know if you guys

say this costs to put this into

coast twelve fifty euro

euro and this guy actually can do it that all of a ninety nine

and that's what how keep the cost down see that has

see that has a lot of modern technology for example the voice recognition always

did we talk about the voice recognition option

on the back you'll notice this area here which is actually the voice recognition a console and

do we have are there are five other words games covers in

plain our those gonna be developed later once we see how to cut we have goal or

as you can see this is just the most superficial where and

and be very easy to put aware of something else like

it's more like a serial faceplate because

if we can just itemise what's in here we've got this it's

with the back and

however clever

push button interface with this other crap know so maybe

it looks like

a bit over budget

what we could do perhaps a simple fix it maybe to switch away from the solar cells

or take out the back up battery

but you have to set up a call centre for that one percent the time people

people groups that i think the long run

if we're gonna try and and do when they would probably have to and you must

but honestly if we cut that one piece our actually coming under budget if at the moment correctly

thing i mean that's what's that's a subway right

you know perhaps when this technology comes down price we can bring that back into the game but it looks

cell but i had kind of have to throw myself in the in that this is structure and model here and

i think that for that's our best option

save it

changing the case wouldn't be so much of a

can we do a good idea

agreement on that

unfortunately i think we are

i no we just go to be project evaluation

we need to use the things that look like we feel are important

is the design what we want it to you it are technologies

basic questions like you know does that are non doesn't

because in user interface

better option than if it goes over with this model we can look into a wider range voice recognition like from other rooms the house of but for

the house of but for now what we've got is working in the range we enforce i'll

it is a setback but

pick up the slide from the coach and

and i'm not what is connected to

and that is going to go into my report so i this

it is now you're in charge so

because if you don't if i wanna say fair enough

right so any thoughts

know i think in general for a day's worth of work we had to hear from the list of reproductive

and if it if you guys been designing in here perhaps than to change but because of

also had i not been intrigued about the pen i don't think it would be used it at all i mean

i am disappointed in can go back to my personal coach

your a personal coach

really whatever really need it

i think the teamwork was good as

right for was enough

just me but i didn't actually get him for a chip that's what it is in a lot of nothing

so i feel like that was slightly

i think that was i think those are a cat finding with regard to no

what my task as because i was gonna take interface function which

is true and again i gotta look at that way to end of it

at et cetera couple moments were just got here and you

if you only imagine

this or like make a remote control or speech chip which

like this together these build space ships why does everybody knows

everybody knows i think that speech that's the only

didn't actually i mean other than my discussion meetings or wasn't it intellectual building but

but i feel like if this was a team production would've been much more of the cleverer like brainstorming use the board

criminal process of

it's anything about the way we got so much for that was the kids from going to the board

know i don't know if there was a right click

i was afraid of break something actually

i don't know what i would've shown on the board

it didn't even occur to me as an option i mean i don't

as an option i mean i don't know but i would have but i know
