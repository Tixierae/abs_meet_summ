at least if you will feel hundred years ago and there was no means of transportation so something or when they had a kitty she would you the notes from one place to another difference whether we use or
there are two all kind of they are we different
they are we different in the in an african elephants so in
so in different design one i thing and a half we can have to and then

so the goal this project used to this lot is a new remote control and
none of the other remotes for like this and
so we should all get saying price of twenty five euro for these remote control
so it's gonna be you ready have a t. v. but you buying an extra remote control for something
it so we should decide which kind of remote control to we want to go should be
should shouldn't be specific remote control to some specific device should it
because it seems quite a lot for remote control so

so i would be that's the best in the project manager
and then we go to will depend on the project and had you know discussions about it
you can discuss that off line
we discussed of off line or do we do it doesn't meeting about on a difference
but this is the next topic was to discuss exactly so it's good to

do we know each day off each design we you would work as separately in d. v. d. really on your speech tasks and we and
do so you have to work on the working design you have to

michael on the user interface designer
and him and the industrial designer
first the functional design the seconds
the seconds the conceptual design and then the
and then the detailed design do

and we need to to discuss and they decisions about what do you did and what did we do next
like to to have the way that like a stream of like to but do we need to know but is
do we need to know but is it acts like a parachute so it can actually kind of going fine you milton you would somewhere else so
the prices but i if that's a requirement that we need to design the product actually fit that price bracket so
bracket so i we don't need to find out what's actually you know what people are willing to pay for
so we need to close the meeting we have

sir i think there's draw my favourite animal see
i don't really have a favourite animal but some
so not the favourite animal but i think now draw a different i tried
and then there's a difference in the trunk all the animals these an
for sound and if and it's that trunk is having one

so we have to do it to have a first kick-off meeting about to use your project going to try to talk about to a few minutes
d. set and and mean you first to to make them to be used to the tools available is and smart meeting room we have here and
so first we have to train ourself with all the the tools of enables in the this and meeting room and but you could every the white board so all the
so it seems the first thing that they've gone so as far as the price like based on how much for we wanna make which seems
so it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting is to have an overview of these and in which direction we should go so we
we have a new meeting soon and

she has some time there's some spot is it within like they have like a kind of them a big bowl of a led
and i don't think it's spot it can actually a fly like to
actually a book for us but might be an all the spot is kind of four so
i was that alliance that they do their hand is the female lion school all kinds of

so all the while going to both to the whiteboard it takes and so some notes a little some drawings still
you can actually draw are pretty in the corner of the whiteboard
but don't get thing it's really difficult to draw and veg
i tried to draw an event so
it seems that the elephants are pretty friendly and

and you don't wanna i'm the marketing expert
and we should target the internet and international market
i think is more a job to work or markets
marketing thoughts on

e. d.s and three step as you know first the functional
was it a three dimensional way but she has some time there's
i what's at a film about that but pounder what i would have time
time i was in that age when anything more shocking me out
because we have only three minutes to go

and so the older work every of you have to do to do so
you have to work on the technical functions and
and you have to work on the user requirements specs right

actually honestly i don't know what's use it to be can be cable or i don't
be cable or i don't know if it's the maple all kinds all it's if he made i

and it should be original trendy and that also user-friendly
friendly and they have one maybe important we a different bill walking so when they walk
so when they walk that would be i went to put their first feed the second people always me when they
so those are important part of the product is about it's not a
