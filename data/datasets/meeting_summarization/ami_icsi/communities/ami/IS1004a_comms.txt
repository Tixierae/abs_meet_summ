e. d.s and three step as you know first the functional
first the functional design the seconds
that smoking strong
i tried to draw an event so
and then there's a difference in the trunk all the animals these an
wind-up
sort or was it to go through and a meeting thank you
some of the time thank you

the seconds the conceptual design and then the
and i cute
cute
none of the other remotes for like this and
it's all at some for sound
for sound and if and it's that trunk is having one
do we have some message that

so we are going to go through d. set and
and sometimes they have a call it seems
and that's very peculiar board that none of the other
and they're really useful to all human beings at least
at least if you will feel hundred years ago and there was no means of transportation so something or when they had a kitty she would you the notes from one place to another difference whether we use or
so in different design one i thing and a half we can have to and then

and then we go to will depend on the project and had you know discussions about it
so the goal this project used to this lot is a new remote control and
and it should be original trendy and that also user-friendly
as usual we folder the project may tu-dum but for using be in that and that'll company e. d.s and three

good morning everybody
good morning everybody not everybody
not everybody in that ready

and we need to to discuss and they decisions about what do you did and what did we do next
no that in pounds or maybe yes
but don't get thing it's really difficult to draw and veg

thank you very interesting
i don't know why not where was that i wanted to be a panther no that
a difference so

so i would be that's the best in the project manager
these an defensible or indian then it's all

and him and the industrial designer
and then the detailed design do

i don't really have a favourite animal but some
and that biggest that is true anymore that's what i know what them

i think i've ever one in mind so
and i can move all that the way the in two dimensions

it has a spiral is in the web
and it has a lakes

so i think they did this in in so what's what that movie that'll
what that movie that'll was

almost

ready

so we have to do it to have a first kick-off meeting about to use your project going to try to talk about to a few minutes

michael on the user interface designer

and you don't wanna i'm the marketing expert

so let's have a look to the hat and

d. set and and mean you first to to make them to be used to the tools available is and smart meeting room we have here and

do we know each day off each design we you would work as separately in d. v. d. really on your speech tasks and we and

so first we have to train ourself with all the the tools of enables in the this and meeting room and but you could every the white board so all the

so all the while going to both to the whiteboard it takes and so some notes a little some drawings still

still want to start

it's not a foster

sir i think there's draw my favourite animal see

i'm gonna say that the spot because you can actually

you can actually draw are pretty in the corner of the whiteboard

that's but it has a spiral

was it a three dimensional way but she has some time there's

she has some time there's some spot is it within like they have like a kind of them a big bowl of a led

and i don't think it's spot it can actually a fly like to

like to to have the way that like a stream of like to but do we need to know but is

do we need to know but is it acts like a parachute so it can actually kind of going fine you milton you would somewhere else so

was actually a book for us but

actually a book for us but might be an all the spot is kind of four so

so that's my animal

to be very funny for us

maybe it's not because it just it someone

actually honestly i don't know what's use it to be can be cable or i don't

be cable or i don't know if it's the maple all kinds all it's if he made i

i was that alliance that they do their hand is the female lion school all kinds of

all kinds of that

i like it because as fast and it's black

it's black as so it can he can hide it so if bit easily and

easily and it's it

it looks like powerful just a thought the

i what's at a film about that but pounder what i would have time

time i was in that age when anything more shocking me out

that's not that's coming out want something that smoking

so not the favourite animal but i think now draw a different i tried

so anything goes like this

i don't know whether there's any test that should be in that sense on it

i think this is the easiest and then

for different

it seems that the elephants are pretty friendly and

friendly and they have one maybe important we a different bill walking so when they walk

so when they walk that would be i went to put their first feed the second people always me when they

when they come to that position the second the court feet would be there that's

and they have on the no usually the one countries and

as that's what i want to have a look at once

so is in you know enough the canal from "'cause" even drawn

from "'cause" even drawn ideas

there are two all kind of they are we different

they are we different in the in an african elephants so in

you can discuss that off line

we discussed of off line or do we do it doesn't meeting about on a difference
