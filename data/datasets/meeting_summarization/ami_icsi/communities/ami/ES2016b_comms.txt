for coming this meeting so
we have some ideas and some
i've was sent a couple more requirements for our remote what they want
then we can come to the conclusion on what we want the remote to do and how
what team are and fun different it needs to
so that even though that's working you press something you
of course it's always a question whether this components are in fact available cheap enough developed enough but that's right
younger generations of people so that they would pay more for speech recognition remote so
volume up volume down change the channel in a channel up channel down i
would that you think that would help us find it specific form that we would want again
over remotes all over typical remotes now are just kind of are eight ten you're sort

i have no idea
and some of them a looks like they really need to include it at all of course channel
all of course channel selection is used most frequently
so maybe we could discuss this and think
we definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance since so many people
we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number
that is the one on the left in
but people said that they would younger
like i don't know if they would actually go out and purchase those them's also fifty email do you know
as and if it's the gimmick factor for the younger people about writing is
which is we put the fashion in electronics and our corporate colours

i'm responsible for leading the meetings keeping the notes and coming up with the final presentation
as far as speech recognition those on the younger group looks like they're all for from
all for from the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more and it kind
that you need it
and as it the major fine
which is what's dictates the design t. both the interface and the outer appearance because this
so those are the three the three new requirements that
and and some summaries for what's going on
you know how to have a look at the actual games in the next break
board to another day and even

to gamble screens or just yours
those are no way i can give you the slide so
and so i will show you some of the results from that which
from that which i think will be helpful
and eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they can get a remote that would look fancy so i think
since so many people seem to be concerned about ugliness of the remote control a
a mall type functional remote can be a good thing to explore so you only have
like a quick
a user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages
right the state

which is a fairly significant number i would say
and then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings where practically never used so
so that we should comes chance to search and
cable there thank you
were too drunk to actually accomplish it so
this is the basic premise of a remote control
clear and energy source feeds an integrated circuit to like chip that can compose
that can compose messages often in the form of infrared bits this is the most
press something you get a response
v. the energy source for one thing can be altered or we probably cannot

let's see last meeting we went over who was responsible for what i'm responsible
at the older they get it looks like the last will and they are today so maybe we could discuss
and reduce the number of buttons get
what i was i think there is take away the society
but one is user centred that
on the other one is something engineer centred that's more
it the major fine isn't market research is a sense is the image the parents that they would they disliked so that we should
expensive it's gonna buy another mat

which controls the infra-red ma'am right these two
because we already decided your pure
your pure research showed that that only as universal remote more complicated it's more costs more costly in your re
so if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem no
no teletext
so we don't worry about that
for you know we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote and that would be

alright let's just got a general quick for this meeting see if i can
and so bay is
of course the signal differs according me depending on what the chip tells the infra-red land them and
but that's right i see i suppose for about a marketing i'm not too
maybe we could sketch so

a t. f. eight
what is going to v. is pretty much on and a survey that
a survey that area cent i have no
is pressed the unit
you want to gamble screens or

the unit that's it
to see something else a screen
and the main buttons are the ones you all the ones you come across
to the industrial design department
we know that the remote's gonna have to be what i was just

that big s. user frustrations as we said fifty percent of people find that they remotes are lost somewhere and
and you need something things like languages and then different than accessible
new requirements that i was told we need to use
that way we kill i mean if it were of
if it were of we're shouldn't for young guy is then it's a certain look to the remote or er roles or older people

thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote
the basic function is to send messages to another system so much
so we could that the more complex
you know how to power it might not
with the buttons being grey or black and

put them on all of us a bit whenever i
i think that's definitely important
possibly it might be worth the investment
i think speech recognition was a lot of things that's really good for them to work sometimes

you click on that
when we were talking about having it be a modern i think that's
unfortunately the people who are supposed to do the sole presentation for me were too
it's also comparatively important on one of those devices

systems but infra-red "'cause" the better of them or more use system part
discuss and of course the energy source batteries solar cells who knows
you're watching something would use all the ones and
i don't have that might come up with a trend watching did you find

thing or we have a touch pad or something like that's something we can
they'd be good if we were going with are ball
you know however you wanna go about it the whole there could also be the charging unit
what i was just say we've got a colour scheme for it

we still have their how to hold onto it in
it's gonna roll way
roll the were
while you're watching that's gonna roll off so

i we do in our remote yes we
crane is our marketing expert she's gonna
i think we could definitely eliminate or somehow

better all go over what we whatever last time which shouldn't take
just usually a battery right
them and of course that's controls the chip itself as control but the user interface we

so you're gonna come up with the ideas rain and you're gonna
that i'm not too soft and that would be to find ways as we should are infra-red that should be too complex
that should be too complex of all

and then we went over a couple of different ideas bowl shape phone the keyword shape we decided
control unit a small but it's too complex
as we've heard a speech recognition is the hype and the moment

do you wanna go first so we can
so we can maybe see what what the people want
in fact controls a chip right

any ideas
part to cheaper as a user interface
or to probably get away with black to do that

some of the findings they said that
they said that the users dislike the look and feel of the current remote controls and seventy
and seventy five percent of the users find the remote controls to be ugly which is a fairly

so i think that earlier were we were on to something when we were talking about
do you have time earlier to work on that do you guys feel you have
but maybe that the next meeting will have to come and so on that

they cat track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons and some
since it's not feasible to add a cable to that this energy
it's a gimmick factor that they like at first and

and then teletext was the next volume and then power and
or what you know i with any form that would be good that could be
then we'll take lunch then we can come back and

or somehow combine a lot of the functions and no one button
i did you do is get time to write everything that you need it
maybe twenty could you could design and

i you should set the movie set them to everything
them to everything and i only have buttons what i was i think
like sitcoms to a t. v. remote control unit a small

you could design and then different people are the functions could use it to set specifications is it a to get something machine each design
it myself i find when you when there's something that speak speech recognition like
like you call on the phone in you try to change your telephone or power or something sometimes they have a speech recognition on the other i mean you

it comes out is what you'd maybe all
what you'd maybe all fifty percent of the buttons use a valid one problem and they could be hidden maybe on that
you know however

what was the last conclusion on a one focus on
from all three of your presentations i think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting
we want something that's simple we want something that

get told
it's gonna cost more it's the the
it's the the younger people say they like it but

see if i can get things move along a little bit better
sounds good approach a technical functions design

which shouldn't take long then
and then as the industrial designer so you're

big seller remote we want it
speech recognition interface we don't know that

that everyone would want
this energy source of course is connected to v. the user interface itself which can

it needs to be sturdy easy to find it so
i didn't have a thought about be so attractive thing is

we decided that it should probably be one hinted something we can use with one hand
and that was our last meeting

do we each of you have a presentation
all here tough to you and

i think you have to escape
so i think still has to be a variation

and fifty percent of users say that the only using ten percent of the buttons on the remote control and
repetitive strain injury

strain injury i think so i
to use and ten percent if it in a way it comes out is

and it kind of just went down incremental a bit groups
bit groups at the older they get

of buttons get rid of the ones that don't seem to be seven much purpose and then
the remote's only gonna be for the television which is good

away the society best maybe concentrate on there is a universal one for t. v.s
few buttons simple

it pays
so much is clear and

it pays to stay pictures of remote controls as a simple
and finally so

in shall i say is less buttons on the other one is something
for that i think should be user interface always say is it

i'm going to do a lot of the on the board
this is what we're talking about here or what i think it should be discussed are these two components most t. v.

we have is different components that need to go in there was started with an
was started with an energy source and

that sends out a signal
but probably a lot of that actually those parents money like i don't know

this can be discussed as
the user interface that's something we can also discussed

i find myself especially if i'm a cat people looking really silly so
what i dunno if we would you want to keep saying if you watch the you're watching

we want something that you can find it easily
then we can come back and work on our individual work

what the current balkans no
that could be the charger for you know we could

and that would be curved solar
curved solar or

with the locator button
if it were the ball it you know one to have a flat space on it

i'll do the minutes
i are mean meeting that we should focus on and tell then it's probably deciding on a certain look

chips that what chips we need and
or maybe a get on it and noble maybe

user interface concept we want to be something simple
minimal number of buttons

ideas for what people want to

long then i believe each of you have a presentation

and then we'll have the closing

which will have forty minutes for

let's see last meeting

she's gonna figure out what that the consumer wants

ryan is our user interface designer

rain and you're gonna become a part

we want it to be universal remote

find it so we can have that locator function

and we want bit different

tough to you and

does anyone do you

or was a function

to go to the next when you click

that's a slide show and something on your screen

you can maybe minimise that screen and then

had in balls about the same time i think

at that so first of

so first of all the method that i used was i doing some marketing research by

by doing research on some interviews that were conducted in and then

in and then some internet research and i

and i was sent a reporter that was

i think there were a hundred a remote users that they energy and so i will show

they say the current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user seventy

seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot and

and if anyone to clarify what that means is that does

is that does that is really changing the channel

lost somewhere and so i think the tracking device of some sort would be a good idea they said at eight

and twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for r. s. i.

just aggressive strain injury i

and so bay

is as far

this and think decide

decide if we think it's worth investing them as a list of are targeting the younger groups

and so in conclusion

in conclusion some things that i drew from that's that i think we were cracked we definitely need

so you only have one rather than five different remotes that in all over your room

and then lastly i thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition

we actually have some ideas of what people want what

people want what we should focus on

having just listened to produce a large on some

a large on some other things as but sometimes up some rather than twelve

the method i used was to explore all the technical functions of remote control and

control and state simplistic approach so i can say is to change programme and operate that right device remotely mean as obvious thing to say

mean as obvious thing to say but

but it's not actual device if you want to control

it then i you should set

controls as a simple t. v. remote controls but

that's more specified for a sub elaborate piece of equipment is try to control

switch appeals more to pull that we want and on

and on what defines a set in the market research just off the public isn't should be user centred few

some remote controls are you malcolm "'cause" i'm a little flip the thing when they're hidden away and the main buttons

so called up for that i think should

something on the image of it but that's

the actual design

o. k. a. don't talk to you about

don't talk to you about be working design of the interior is in which is what's

because this is all the that needs to go in there right

so unfortunately

is the most that's the used

there's also some sound systems but infra-red

this is where my people screwed up some

some going to explain that's on the board of that

which can be buttons whatever which in fact

the state user interface and that we have

and that we have the chip the way this

the way this goes nominees that this chip then controls an infrared lamp

we normally do it is that you had a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as so that even though

or we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared the sending device the infrared we cannot

we cannot change the chip which controls

right these two or components that we have to use and

we have to use and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing

thing but then i can be put on to the design a device it can it

it can it doesn't have to be this can be discussed

or if we just do the usual button thing or

that's something we can discuss and

that the more complex to make it of course the more expensive

them to work sometimes you guys have the same things over and i'll give you some you found

saying you find is like you said same thing over and over the over i find

maybe if you're sitting on your catch with a bunch people then

another thing about these figures as ninety one percent of the youngest age groups they do that but

about writing is it

but you know button

i was sent a couple of things to modify are the new requirements

in your re research showed that you know most the people don't even use it i think

use it i think you said fifty percent of the people use have them or ten percent of buttons so if we

that they company wants us to incorporate be corporate colour and our slogan which is we put the

and our corporate colours are grey and yellow

we want something that looks good

and the speech recognition i is kind of give or take it's gonna cost more

probably i would say probably not worth the investment at this point in time so maybe

so maybe we should just do away with speech recognition

and that we can focus on our form

that it a maybe a holder whole story on the call it

call it but you should put it back in your mobile but if you don't put

but if you don't put it back in you press a melissa but from that i'm not too

are you to add on the couch table while you're watching that's gonna

that's not a nursery

so i after the meeting we'll have some questionnaires and

it looks like you're already on your way for working with the components

do you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done

i tried to us do still think you need to be some is also the one on this board to another

day and even some sell but that might be difficult so

on it and noble maybe not so is boring as players that i know

should we maybe issue for a specific the target group

yellow and you know yellow it's

you know yellow it's and brown it's with the buttons

and they're slowly and pasted somewhere on it on them the bond
