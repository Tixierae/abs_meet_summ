then we can come to the conclusion on what we want the remote to do and how
big seller remote we want it
a mall type functional remote can be a good thing to explore so you only have
so you only have one rather than five different remotes that in all over your room
the remote's only gonna be for the television which is good
for you know we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote and that would be
over remotes all over typical remotes now are just kind of are eight ten you're sort
which made if you are purpose for being able remote all the time but then again you don't want
what remotes look like now is kind of what we're but we're stuck with

the method i used was to explore all the technical functions of remote control and
it pays to stay pictures of remote controls as a simple
controls as a simple t. v. remote controls but
like sitcoms to a t. v. remote control unit a small
this is the basic premise of a remote control
that come from big thick block things is only one remote control is to solve slinky small things

a user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages
them and of course that's controls the chip itself as control but the user interface we

we want it to be universal remote
your pure research showed that that only as universal remote more complicated it's more costs more costly in your re
so if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem no

i think there were a hundred a remote users that they energy and so i will show
they said that the users dislike the look and feel of the current remote controls and seventy
they say the current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user seventy

in shall i say is less buttons on the other one is something
few buttons simple
which can be buttons whatever which in fact
or if we just do the usual button thing or
with the locator button
you know yellow it's and brown it's with the buttons
with the buttons being grey or black and
a menu button maybe
and maybe you bring the buttons near to the all the import more important buttons near to be the side right

that's what i think we've got to kind of a good point there least for what buttons we're gonna use

as far as speech recognition those on the younger group looks like they're all for from
younger generations of people so that they would pay more for speech recognition remote so

and reduce the number of buttons get
minimal number of buttons
know with minimal number of buttons

or somehow combine a lot of the functions and no one button

but people said that they would younger
as and if it's the gimmick factor for the younger people about writing is
it's the the younger people say they like it but

it looks like you're already on your way for working with the components
manual you're going to work on the components for what we're gonna use let's

ryan is our user interface designer
but one is user centred that
for that i think should be user interface always say is it
which is what's dictates the design t. both the interface and the outer appearance because this
part to cheaper as a user interface
this energy source of course is connected to v. the user interface itself which can
the state user interface and that we have
the user interface that's something we can also discussed
user interface concept we want to be something simple

some remote controls are you malcolm "'cause" i'm a little flip the thing when they're hidden away and the main buttons
and the main buttons are the ones you all the ones you come across

and fifty percent of users say that the only using ten percent of the buttons on the remote control and
that big s. user frustrations as we said fifty percent of people find that they remotes are lost somewhere and
to use and ten percent if it in a way it comes out is
what you'd maybe all fifty percent of the buttons use a valid one problem and they could be hidden maybe on that
like i don't know if they would actually go out and purchase those them's also fifty email do you know
use it i think you said fifty percent of the people use have them or ten percent of buttons so if we
if you if we want the remote to do other things like are you i the t. v. to be able to change the ten the colour and you know all those kind of things are built in the t. v.s we just have that other one standard menu button where you go in
