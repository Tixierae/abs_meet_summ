designing a remote control
that's a design that should be like a main design in the former control do you know your

like how much does you know remote control cost
controls are you how it how good a remote control but we can't you
out as don't think remote controls being summoned something people consciously s. f.s in the purchasing habits it's just
so and then was just "'cause" i'm a devices control
together but i differ remote controls which you know so
so anything else anybody wants at it but what they don't like about remote controls and use what they you
and i remember when the first remote control might much and we had was on a cable actually cable between get

as for designing a new remote control and i'll have to
yes it is the design a new remote control
new remote control as you can see this be original trendy and user-friendly
so like i wonder if we might add something new to the remote control market such as

for a remote control to think that would be i suppose depends
i suppose depends on how complicated our remote control is

as and i've never bought a remote
i've never bought a remote controls are you

i mean one we look at a be the people producing television set maybe they have to buy a remote control is another way is
is another way is maybe people had t. v. set a really set up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something
are we may train on the assumption that are television remote control may have features which could be on the television or

i that's up to our industrial designer
so in between nine and as the industrial designer you're gonna be working on you know that's a working design of that so you

so current a brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro
twenty five euro remote control might be a big hit in london might not be such
twenty five euro mean that thumb that's quite like eighteen pounds or something isn't are know

get more control over it should be writing
over it should be writing all this time
minutes and i'll just write nothing else

so that's kind of or brief the y.
superb stage kind of
and that kind of affectionate and
right away and making some kind of assumptions about what information we're getting here thinking
yes is it has to look kind of and gimmicky
better but actually it's still kind of i don't know like a massive junkie thing on the table maybe we could think
i mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of that so

and i'm andrew and i'm the marketing
i'm thinking the price might appeal to a certain market in one region where is in another it would be different so
marketing get more control
market such as the lighting in your hair so our
and marketing executive

or just like basic product that is positioning twenty five
so i'm wondering right away is selling twenty
is selling twenty five years is that so that is it's gonna

the y. and so there are three different stages to the design and i'm laurie what
as as characters different
different keypad styles and simple
in time but i'm more controls because the fed up of having four five different calls for each ten times so and then
so they will work actually function together but i differ

so we're gonna be selling this an international scale and
and we do want it to cost any more than twelve fifty euros and fifty percent of the selling price
the selling price is a wholesaler reach like on the shelf
our sell our selling
i imagine it probably is are sell actually because it's probably

right so in function wanna priorities might be too combine as many uses
to extra functionalities
if it could be the functionally that doesn't make any better but that just t.
