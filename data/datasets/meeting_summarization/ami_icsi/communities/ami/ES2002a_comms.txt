and create an easy interface
i'll have to record easier actually so that's
so that's do that and encourages know
the y. and so there are three different stages to the design and i'm laurie what
this is quite music say
couldn't see it as i she's had is generate and
and we do want it to cost any more than twelve fifty euros and fifty percent of the selling price
and we discover that again
so cost like production cost is twelve fifty the selling price
i imagine it probably is are sell actually because it's probably
all right away i'm wondering if there is and like the d. v. d. players if they are zones
regions and
frequencies are some way
it does make sense when it is i think it's
or just like in terms of like the wealth of the country like
just a characteristic
or just like basic product that is positioning twenty five
might not be such a big hit in and greece you know something
here thinking "'kay" trendy probably means something other than just basic something other
as much as a sixteen
sixteen seventeen eighteen points
yes is it has to look kind of and gimmicky
do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other
that would be useful though it may if you
maybe what we could use as a sort of like an example of a successful at this technology is palm pilots there go on from being
to extra functionalities

as the kick-off meeting for our project i
this is what we're gonna be doing as an extra five minutes
i just got the project announcement that designing
carets very characteristics that that i right
right a high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from the family and
it's bigger even this "'cause" i'm allergic to most animals but
superb stage kind of
i'm thinking the price might appeal to a certain market in one region where is in another it would be different so
that is it's gonna be like the premium product
like how much does you know remote control cost
i've never bought a remote controls are you
controls are you how it how good a remote control but we can't you
is another way is maybe people had t. v. set a really set up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something
in time but i'm more controls because the fed up of having four five different calls for each ten times so and then
so and then was just "'cause" i'm a devices control
market such as the lighting in your hair so our
watch slightly my pen they're all i want one sentence estimate and that's a good idea
at all gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly a couple of minutes and

i was good to use a dog as but
and that kind of affectionate and
so current a brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro
euro i'm we're aiming to make fifty million euro
but i might to ask
to ask a question
together but i differ remote controls which you know so

manager two and to introduce yourself to get
five minutes and the meeting
right so in function wanna priorities might be too combine as many uses

and you'll right on time
i don't know minus and i think on the spot
and i kinda like wheels becoming more i

that doesn't really look like actually
it's more like a pig actually
you know so it's sort of ironic that then they're in there

and i need to discuss the project finance
as as characters different
i suppose depends on how complicated our remote control is

so of course we'll just a kind of make that we all know each other if i'm right
other if i'm right and then the project manager

yes it is the design a new remote control
so like i wonder if we might add something new to the remote control market such as

so we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it and
and repeat that process three times

and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there i have a
so that you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of that to see

my favourite animal is why
carets very characteristics

and we have lots of personality and
becoming more i eat everything in sight not quite harmless

good health so this is blue to
to be a i send it to

you take as long over this is it like because
this is it like because we have an what an awful lot to discuss a call it a

a call it a day to fill
day to fill out your interest anyway

is that away on
i don't know it's just first i might need off the top of my head it's

on my favourite animal is my own though look at home
colour when use little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned

he's the next year old various things
it and what they like about that that this to suggest

hi i'm david and i'm supposed to be industrial designer

and i'm andrew and i'm the marketing

as for designing a new remote control and i'll have to

new remote control as you can see this be original trendy and user-friendly

so that's kind of or brief the y.

and i'm laurie what would you guys have already received in your emails what did you get

designing a remote control

in case you

is that what everybody calls

of that to see if you'd like to go first very

alright my favourite animal

and these s. and then robust good health so

i send it to you

no might have an would be a monkey

the small keys already had a one point eight

a one point eight seconds real not a i'm one that but with them

it for the whole lot more about the school

a kid so what i might

kid so what i might have to get again then

and i think on the spot

animals but you channel four so

you channel four so issues a natural choice

and i kinda like wheels

not quite harmless and my role than interesting

i saw

i saw the note of interaction but

tales bit bigger

but i just a different kind of talk on my favourite animal

i see a dog in there

are the three good idea

that this to suggest that his tail wags and it's

and it's very friendly interior and orestes to see and that

and it's quite we as so you know you can doesn't take up too much space

the leaders of anything which is still as this is quite music

and it just all this and this get up and start chasing its tail with round living room

and where she found this just an here

meeting next

so we're gonna be selling this an international scale and

the selling price is a wholesaler reach like on the shelf

like on the shelf

our sell our selling

actually because it's probably up to the the retail or two some of whatever price they want

i don't know i mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on a redesign it at all

different keypad styles and simple

for a remote control to think that would be i suppose depends

is i think it's you have more complicated right here in languages and the buttons

and then at it and then all of the other thing international is on top of the price i'm thinking

like how much money people have to spend on things that

twenty five euro remote control might be a big hit in london might not be such

marketing get more control

get more control over it should be writing

over it should be writing all this time

right away and making some kind of assumptions about what information we're getting here thinking

something other than just standard and

so i'm wondering right away is selling twenty

is selling twenty five years is that so that is it's gonna

twenty five euro mean that thumb that's quite like eighteen pounds or something isn't are know

as and i've never bought a remote

we just go on add

that does anybody have anything to add to to the finance issue at all

though it may if you knew like what your money look at you know

here interesting thing about discussing the production remote control for me is that we as you point

we as you point out as don't

out as don't think remote controls being summoned something people consciously s. f.s in the purchasing habits it's just

it's just like getting shoelaces issues or something this comes

this comes one

we're over the hand

we're over the hand

i mean one we look at a be the people producing television set maybe they have to buy a remote control is another way is

that's a design that should be like a main design in the former control do you know your

your satellite than your regular tally in your v. c. r. and everything

there go on from being just like little sort of scribble boards to the cameras m. p. three players telephones

everything agenda so like i wonder

or even a in a it's a ball it's what you wanna watch slightly my

and that's a good idea to extra

but personally for me at home i've combined the the audio video might television set in my d. v. d. player m. s. c. d. player so

so they will work actually function together but i differ

you know the sound everything is just one system but each one's
