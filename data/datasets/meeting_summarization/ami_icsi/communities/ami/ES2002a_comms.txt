designing a remote control
like how much does you know remote control cost
controls are you how it how good a remote control but we can't you
here interesting thing about discussing the production remote control for me is that we as you point
out as don't think remote controls being summoned something people consciously s. f.s in the purchasing habits it's just
together but i differ remote controls which you know so
so anything else anybody wants at it but what they don't like about remote controls and use what they you
and i remember when the first remote control might much and we had was on a cable actually cable between get

get more control over it should be writing
in time but i'm more controls because the fed up of having four five different calls for each ten times so and then
so and then was just "'cause" i'm a devices control

for a remote control to think that would be i suppose depends
i suppose depends on how complicated our remote control is

as for designing a new remote control and i'll have to
yes it is the design a new remote control
new remote control as you can see this be original trendy and user-friendly
so like i wonder if we might add something new to the remote control market such as
what they you would really like to be part of this new one at all

as and i've never bought a remote
i've never bought a remote controls are you

i mean one we look at a be the people producing television set maybe they have to buy a remote control is another way is
is another way is maybe people had t. v. set a really set up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something
are we may train on the assumption that are television remote control may have features which could be on the television or

so that's kind of or brief the y.
superb stage kind of
and that kind of affectionate and
right away and making some kind of assumptions about what information we're getting here thinking
yes is it has to look kind of and gimmicky
i mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of that so

hi i'm david and i'm supposed to be industrial designer
the y. and so there are three different stages to the design and i'm laurie what
i just got the project announcement that designing
that's a design that should be like a main design in the former control do you know your
i that's up to our industrial designer
so in between nine and as the industrial designer you're gonna be working on you know that's a working design of that so you
yes it's at the functional design stages next i
or are we keeping sort of like design commitment to television features and

and i'm andrew and i'm the marketing
i'm thinking the price might appeal to a certain market in one region where is in another it would be different so
marketing get more control
market such as the lighting in your hair so our
and marketing executive

so we're gonna be selling this an international scale and
the selling price is a wholesaler reach like on the shelf
our sell our selling
i imagine it probably is are sell actually because it's probably

to extra functionalities
so they will work actually function together but i differ
better but actually it's still kind of i don't know like a massive junkie thing on the table maybe we could think
if it could be the functionally that doesn't make any better but that just t.
functions i that's you know like what we've been talking about what i'll actually day

so current a brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro
or just like basic product that is positioning twenty five
twenty five euro remote control might be a big hit in london might not be such
might not be such a big hit in and greece you know something
so i'm wondering right away is selling twenty
is selling twenty five years is that so that is it's gonna
twenty five euro mean that thumb that's quite like eighteen pounds or something isn't are know
actually cable between get the t. v. in big like
the t. v. in big like buttons as sort of like on a blind or something and

euro i'm we're aiming to make fifty million euro
and we do want it to cost any more than twelve fifty euros and fifty percent of the selling price
so cost like production cost is twelve fifty the selling price
i don't want that it would be production cost

and repeat that process three times
over it should be writing all this time

that is it's gonna be like the premium product
