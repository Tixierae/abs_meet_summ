experience with remote control so i talk about
get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls and then and what we
right it on experiences with remote controls and

but i get the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something
the moment week to remote "'cause" we this
remote "'cause" we this about with the what we do in a remote is just saying what we'd like and then after we
so it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together by making them thinner and into one
that's true maybe we should just concentrate on having it at the t. v. remote can have it be
remote spending from other remotes everyone lasted remotes the side

project aim is a new remote control to
it's t. v. remote control
and new remote control for t. v.
that it doesn't have to be really thick every remote controls
thick every remote controls can be within that and
and then on the the sign what one remote control that would be very simple was just the channel program plus and minus and then just the mute button for example i can we keep it really
we should have a backup plan or just a really good television remote control that just that is just for t. v. but it's just a really good one

the back end of an awful
i think we're doing before we close the meeting was supposed to come up with some ideas for
seems like there's sort of a tension between two ideas i mean you want
ideas i mean you want i want one remote that maybe to work all the functions of t. v. and if you have
'cause our we know saying in something that's got different but maybe at and l. c. d. display on it that to a different pages for different devices
and then after we want to find what we can like some different ideas we can end and do research to find out if these any of these ideas or feasible or not so the be
so the be to have something that controls lots of different things
i think we'll be able to come up with ideas and lot quicker

how of one very complicated one on one side with all the t. v. d. and d. c. or excess and and then
i can we keep it really simple one side and the other side be very complicated
one side kids one side for adults
i'm not if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote that "'cause"
sided remote that "'cause" it would be very hard to use in the way that you but then you can either

project method functional design individual work and then the meeting conceptual
the meeting conceptual design individual work and a meeting detailed design individual
design individual work in the meeting
the question of this can work
so i that was the test to see if this equipment so working
i by the end of this meeting we should have at least a rough conceptual it was stage
you to you two are gonna be just i think it is that but you know you working together
we've been want to finish the meeting now

try out the whiteboard and a protestant
i'll try my best control
but the functions that were that we want our that it can control the t. v. but also devices
something that i mean we don't we have been told has to be something that all control everything we should have
easy you don't you you're you're in we wanna try to know what buttons we need

it's industrial designer which is not to go first
and this i say six designer you're left go next
it was stage one was technical functions design what affect the
industrial designer
industrial design you're the one of you know you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in i so

and a protestant should draw my favourite animal and sum up my favourite characteristics of that animal
so my favourite animal
what's your favourite animal
on theirs is you know some of the of your favourite characteristics of that animal
i don't actually have a favourite animal but for the
animal but for the for this playing else true or

hold like to wouldn't be able to press the buttons but
flip it open and you got all the buttons or you flip it closing you just got there basic buttons on the outside maybe
very or big buttons for a touchy buttons
causes so you don't accidentally press a button or record buttons or something

and usually cats very friendly usually
look at five or six remotes an alkaline on the cat's use

the what'll make it interesting for people to buy though i mean if it's
maybe even said something that's for the disabled people will also
people will also be learned don't see very or
so to find a niche for our remote the market it to a certain kind of people
make it like really snazzy and what people want it to make
the other one is gonna go find that to the research see what people want
see what people want in a remote what buttons we use more often and like that

and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much last semester animal
it's very pretty cat
pretty much everybody
or just one that looks pretty fucking

to original trendy and user-friendly project
that's true a user name it doesn't
a user name it doesn't have to have a flip function at least have a lock functions so that it's
user interface designer that's that's
so what the user requires

so i think before we close the were expected that in the last slide
that in the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer or whatever what ideas where i mean
ideas where i mean if you wanna go back to the last slide it's
that and then you have one few d. v. d. in this slide that then you have another
then you have another one slide about finance
finance slides and then the
slides and then the call comes compact
no but you would slide didn't see some of like something on the back would hold like to
