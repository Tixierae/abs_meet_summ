some since ours and we also want to look at or more control so
i say you don't use it and the control just looks

we got our profit remote control with a lot of buttons and
is called a meaning remote control
to them so we it's like a signature my remote control
could do integrate some into our remote control something like a light
and as a remote controls going to the smart but to
are you saying here that the remote control should be aware of who's using it so
and then i hope this can help us to understand how we should design a remote control so
and asked real people who are using real remote controlled every day and or any other to me that you see that the remote control we should
than that and it's not what to do it the remote control

kind of people dollars for which the remote control is is to be something useful that i'm going to talk
and finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but
a remote control but it seems that's so important but it's used as a remote control next

just because it's easy colour that we don't usually see the remote control why
remote control we should be easy to use a small device that people may have with them always liked the phone we
which is that it should be easy to use as a remote control so as you see

and we have to take a decision on the controlled remote control concepts and we have
kind of upgrade able a remote control wall
but you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control was you all the time
they like processed take the ipod it's a kind of remote control and

we would like to have sons speech recognition and it's cheap you know or a remote control
that was the speech recognition technology we take at least five euros or that you put some control we want to reduce
but we may have a remote controls and speech recognition

my remote control is pink nobody
nobody else than me has a pink remote control and that makes me
so i think if nobody else probe provides currently a remote control of that kind of and if we can provide you guys think it's a good sell for us because we have it than

so we are looking for somebody was as source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
noise like that was remote control room use for like in a whole sort of saw it
if we look back and not to look at a new remote controls i think it's important to see that the trains are quite the same in many are a sole

simple button and speech recognition for the more complicated
he we have a simple buttons and speech recognition technology so

and then like titanium is can we each have really good look and
so silly they're looking
silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle you know or four euros or on that so we are looking for
if we're going for more speaker and a pen and then it would be looking and come us and
and it's good just a few buttons quite looking and all this we already discussed and though
it has this distinctive look and feel and you look they do which people seems
that and i'll in a marriage are all the brawl the way of saying the thing if we look back
then in the shape it has to be more wrong than the more roo look natural somehow i mean
that's a good to look for a lot of tomatoes and

but they are it in the market of remote controls they are free aspects that we should be re pay much attention to the first one

generally add developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface but for possible instruction or users many all and so all that complex saying so it's come together with your t. v. and remote controls so was that as
general i think people change t. v. more often than batteries on their remote control so

and we can use some jet morning joe kind of thing
i think the colours the kind of like a real if it's

and you seen that we don't have to make it to make them pay more because of
anyone has a remote control seen that
but process i'm thinking about that either part you could argue that the remote control could have just seen
just seen even those who he's using it might also a record
where each button does anyone think

a concept of the interface generally add developed
because from your survey people like or no
because it i think that kind of people dollars
you did a young people the young people want to be different from their friends all those
is something that people are proud of
so what are what location and these people are really interesting on those features or
anyway it's very general i think people
