i wouldn't be in the secretary but
gone is to include video i was d. display l. c. d.
like an lighting we have many options in the market so we
so how to how i'd how to define or a speech recogniser but we
and with that explanation for every button and
maybe this button is power on and off on a team for
i can see nothing so
so that's our concept
that's our concept is called
but instead of these i would device that's a cost
and though what will people say
as they will say it's planted and
and everyone's gonna be a certified
not the case
that's five "'cause" it's tea
so you propose something with option to be that increase the price if we use if you want on them a week or is it only has to be
can make it in fact if
to them so we it's like a signature my remote control
my remote control is pink nobody
and it's white and it's all
and it's all why did you see it from a anywhere it has this
first is the young guy would that be able to use it because
i cannot

to inside there is no that's right
what and that can be we can spare we was
can spare we was it won't take much my name is
you have one more question
and they're more dynamic also
this is more risky because you're not following

so maybe that's if that's it says selling point maybe it has to be the base
but you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control was you all the time
and it's makes a difference you know
and asked real people who are using real remote controlled every day and or any other to me that you see that the remote control we should
i've got all dark blue who are watching the trends are also have also to be as bad because
there inventing it you're creating the trend i hope

lights lighting in mind thirteen and it's problem
we want to go for simpler pushbuttons because
is that number three
this is a very ugly
just press a button say so

but for you to some blue you use maybe for the addendum nobody's expense
because from your survey people like or no
i don't know i don't have a nokia phone
that's why you don't have that's five "'cause" it's
used if they want they can display another no you this

first yes ma'am
we need to we would like
we would like to have sons speech recognition and it's cheap you know or a remote control
so these can be simple to kind of program where the chip and which

for energy there are many what the possibilities first
what is a double curved two
puts lots of concentrate on what we can do that
and then there's something that contains very novel that we can talk

sensitive you just to for output
on a team for i can see nothing
like turn it on
because his father doesn't want like

in the market so we can go for small need to learn or a look and batteries for
come us and we need really and more technology and
criterion the trends that we seen big cities like paris and milan it seems that this year think it should have a fruit and vegetable way of the of look or see you or
i think of course it you get passed away everything that's the thing with

but that's maybe more too much expensive but they can be
we can test it does
you did a young people the young people want to be different from their friends all those
it has this distinctive look and feel and you look they do which people seems

we have three presentation first to to can just redesign first and then that mark and then sandy
but process i'm thinking about that either part you could argue that the remote control could have just seen
i think the rubber aspect might be important because it's

and then like titanium is can we each have really good look and
so i'll be discussed
excuse me

our and oscillating if you put bar it's a big if you go to do all the morning or more times and these things and
it's not gonna be it not touchable but still
fall

is called a meaning remote control
back to it
that you can being e. that the side with

that's the question to you
i say you don't use it and the control just looks
strangely enough it's more important to be fancy then to be with an that's the second thing you'd have to be it has to be technologically you do the t. v. has

calls lunch
bob be sarcastic

decision we want to take on this meeting are on the them first and component concept so what kind of energy we use what kind of chip on print and one cat kind of case and also
but it would be expensive they feel is colour l. c. d.

and then interface there to use pushbuttons or you could just read it c. d. display and
and so it rather say i would buy it and everyone's

so silly they're looking
and power on and off i don't remember so that

like you can have calls
you made him and i have that

our which means advanced chip technology and
chip technology and it's more expensive since

expensive since we want to port some other features that speech recognition you want the radios
it's not gonna be a touchpad it just a display for the t. v. you information

but there are some rubber i don't know some rubber parts like
to make it feel better

recogniser so we want to reduce price on this technology and so
simple button and speech recognition for the more complicated

that was the speech recognition technology we take at least five euros or that you put some control we want to reduce
we want to reduce the cost on the display or these

you have any for that question
sort of saw it will be it and maybe at least five six people do want to use it so

recogniser but we want to goals speaker independent or speaker dependent if we're going
and it's good just a few buttons quite looking and all this we already discussed and though

that could look at this know it's
and so on the l. c. d. is going to be somewhere here are

do you think you can come in several colours
anyone has a remote control seen that

because it i think that kind of people dollars
kind of people dollars for which the remote control is is to be something useful that i'm going to talk

and that makes me special
and you seen that we don't have to make it to make them pay more because of

because of a lot thesis
i think that would be ready pretty to pay more for that

but to follow smart should be some not too complicated things too much
that it's easy but it's not so simple anyway these days the

just in so we want to do some speaker the pen and speech recognition and so you can use them
and then interestingly this is the very most important thing it has to be fancy

but they are it in the market of remote controls they are free aspects that we should be re pay much attention to the first one
the first one which seems to be the most important one is that it has to be fancy have to have a fancy look-and-feel and then interestingly

which we may think that would have been the most important which is that
a remote control but it seems that's so important but it's used as a remote control next

i cannot maybe
when we were talking about rubber i think

now we are in there and conceptual design meeting

getting close to the next is to

to can use to meeting

bob be sarcastic mark

and we have to take a decision on the controlled remote control concepts and we have

and we have forty minutes

what we want to decision we want

and also on the user interface concept what kind of interface we used and if there is some supplements and the

and the sammy will give the will trendwatching on what he's been doing it

let's go first

so of their to me it is and we need to know each component to use for energy and the media and the interface for energy

first one we can use simple battery or

battery or we can use traditional solar cells for

whom and then material we can have placed a job or

job or we to use good for this to say and then

and we can use some jet morning joe kind of thing

so long as

as we discussed before we need to

and which can use make reform as as some

some since ours and we also want to look at or more control so

silly they're looking for a possible to you can get the specifications and all these easy you can do and begin or pro range like a miracle you know or four euros or on that so we are looking for

so we are looking for somebody was as source simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house

i'll be discussed and

so we would like to propose but the use of solar cells and

cells and it would be a problem or do they do have enough energy would solar cells hand

solar cells hand too late to just use simple battery and

battery and also we want to go for titanium design we should of rub or and

but the problem is that this design we phone that we can't use the double record shapes

because it need a simple chip and it's

chip and it's really let's say you really less expensive compared to l. c. d. is

you want the radios cost

i want to know there's just a story that for the point before why not the rubber you think is something that's it seems to be there

you know titanium it's more

or can use some sort of like you know this whole body is titanium but there are some

to make it feel better and to

like in cell phones we should leave these

these you can mall with the rubber and four directions and

nobody's expense two and also it's

and also it's made if we're gonna do the one issue and

and these push word and see you like

see you like use pushbuttons and l. c. d.s and

d.s and so we want to more than

more than men were was some there you go to put a speech recogniser so we

technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money on

so simple

he we have a simple buttons and speech recognition technology so

and still would have gone

but still like a source of information a source for menus

maybe we can see the body one call really come up with our forties and then

and then if you have enough money or like four and that was the speech recognition

try this thing

the display would only be displayed and not a touch sensitive you just

question

so the batteries are having to be very light

look and batteries for really like batteries and we will good price

so these device on that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for do is a finding the t. v. itself

itself clapping why not just be ask

then the one thing we want to noise like that was

noise like that was remote control room use for like in a whole sort of saw it

if we're going for more speaker and a pen and then it would be looking and come us and

technology and so

for the location

if you ready in the post and down to locate then we have to go for some speaker and then it could only or something

going to do it puts lots of concentrate

you know more questions

in the end we find out that it's not feasible

we haven't made some limitations on

i know let's talk about the interface

is that number three

a sorrows a concept

a concept of the interface generally add developed

generally add developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface but for possible instruction or users many all and so all that complex saying so it's come together with your t. v. and remote controls so was that as

so was that as we got our profit

we got our profit remote control with a lot of buttons and

every button and you can use your time on to it will take it some days to loan all these buttons and so

and go back button i don't know the weirdest maybe one of these buttons and

it should be maybe this button

that's change meeting you

maybe you can use for opposing the innocent

that doesn't make sense this is a very

no the wisconsin

i will not use this but instead of

they'll say it's perfect or

i would make our back light kills a l. c. d. screen was different colours

but not the case

the case would only be in that'd be titanium

let's remember has a nokia phone which changeable panels

line that maybe you can change the colour of this and maybe you can used

maybe you can used if you just one more colours

if you just one more colours they can be more money too bad these and the shapes and then they can have different assembly

so you just have different them and they have their own interest colour into it sends one

kind of upgrade able a remote control wall

this did you get few more things into more colours

there's one more this it what a solution fact "'cause" there are some

'cause there are some paints that can change colour according to where is that like as

like as a kind of flat different colours depending on what is around like what colours around and depending on the temperature

but they can be in there maybe in and grey double very but

i'm going to talk about this later but

and also which it's something that the is there a specific to them so we

nobody else than me has a pink remote control and that makes me

those who wanted to have it be

it's not the others they said it's

it might be optional would have

but does but we really feel most warlike

all those similar but have something just slightly better think

you know anyone

know no no i want to change my name

a are a lot all you don't you don't have a little ahead

you know they like processed take

they like processed take the ipod it's a kind of remote control and

which people seems to like just

just because it's easy colour that we don't usually see the remote control why

could do integrate some into our remote control something like a light

thing is important

that i can use it and that has and lights

over to wind it back to

maybe like the aim for i think we can put on helium two or something so

let's go and maybe was a presentation and

and as a remote controls going to the smart but to

question to you and to two

so i heard that it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done so

so that's the smart less of the thing pretty

of the thing pretty we don't have guns we speech recognition or a beer cans with speech recognition but we may

but we may have a remote controls and speech recognition

are you saying here that the remote control should be aware of who's using it so

i just want to say it should be real smart

in a fingerprint recognition

voice recognition is quite enough i say you don't

'cause i ordered just and what not

that and that could be feasible like this but

so it could be smart and that way

just seen even those who he's using it might also a record

it might also a record the kind of the channels are you more often using the the levels of volumes that you're more are from the things like that and

like that and provide you ways of using them i don't know somehow i dunno that might

i dunno that might be expensive but

that might also be a good sales speech again the room all

the room all that the with you

that's marketing expert

participant two four

for i think trend

so i'm going to talk about trends and then i

and then i hope this can help us to understand how we should design a remote control so

next slide please so

first maybe just the small recap on how do we watch trends so it's not so

so it's not so simple you

simple you might think that it's easy but

anyway these days the best source of information is the weather is you know also

have to go off and on the way then look at the what the others are doing and asked

remote control we should be easy to use a small device that people may have with them always liked the phone we

the phone we can use the phone as a good to example of work to it beeps back

also to be as bad because in fact they are not only watching the trends there inventing it

trend i hope i'm going to try to help you want that this is more risky

because you're not following the train you tried to

the train you tried to invent it which means either use

which means either use sixty then you make a lot of money are you don't and you're out of business so anyway

so anyway next slide please

next slide please

had to be quick there's

there's a lot of words here but they

you do the t. v. has to be new with some of the newer technology inside and

and and this is also a more important than the last thing which we

which is that it should be easy to use as a remote control so as you see

so as you see there you first have to be very is something

is something that people are proud of

that we can talk about with their friends mine has this and that euros and finally

and finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but

next slide please

that and i'll in a marriage are all the brawl the way of saying the thing if we look back

if we look back and not to look at a new remote controls i think it's important to see that the trains are quite the same in many are a sole

that's the thing with friends you

friends you can travel from golf to furniture so it might be fruit and vegetable

fruit and vegetable thing fruit and vegetable and

and if you were week about the last year now it has to be spongy
