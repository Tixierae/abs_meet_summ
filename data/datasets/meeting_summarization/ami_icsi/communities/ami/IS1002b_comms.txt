we are if you have to talk about functional design know hopefully
that possibly could also be enough opportunity because and saying
because and saying that teletext becoming addicted some sort remote control that can work with the internet there is an opportunity that presented i
right no i agree with you so what i'm talking about
so what i'm talking about is i see that once i were them in a sound thing so we have to come up with another side which is what are we
which is what are we gonna be targeting a market that identifies our product is better than because it doesn't have teletext it has that so that's that
but we are so it being dictated that this should only be used for the tell them to look like faxed
to look like faxed to really
so we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any t. v. that we people use a remote that
so it's kind of a stick to that
selling price we really have to innovate i
that's that's what i'm talking about is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product is somebody some people
is somebody some people are gonna be happy unhappy "'cause" it to make it
what are we bringing to take the place of this and we have to
of this and we have to do it might mean we have the double up if we lose
you can you handle that black and yellow
i think what the things that we should also keep in mind when we doing this i mean our company slogan is we put the fashion in electronics right so i
so i think are kind of our target here it is to have some kind of very like sleek and looking remote and we want
remote and we want it to be functional as but i think one of the
so we have three presentations and
that to click on that
mean we need some kind of power source
we have to decide and our user interface which is his department that
so we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so require
and everything else is pretty much a open to move around
this is that this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here we're talking about existing
i mean that i mean they you can kind of say would fall under the user interface and the visual signal processing chip but
be the chip and the it could also
also the user interface and the casing a gonna be expensive as
the l. e. d. and that the transistors and everything else or you know they're pretty cheap so
you have any ball park figures for that
have to spend you should leave it at all
so function design
so we met we have to make it look good something
there's no need to have them the remote so
far as i know it's just that the cost of an extra button i mean software rise
i have maybe a silly question like in
i don't understand how those two things are connected how this have is
and to find out what you're watching even if it's commercials you know
there is that for example that useful t. v. systems you have you can press a button then you can buy things in a drought and
a family member mean he's got system where you just you can the and there's other
you're not gonna be able to make them and it's you know with a remote i don't think
we would increase the price to try to make it a try to want so
it "'cause" we're designing something for television
the and the message really wanna be sending to them is that a little teletext may become outdated and there's no what you can not having it in there anyway if it doesn't affect the price is
we're selling it to an existing market
the same because all of a sudden we're gonna have cost overruns so if we drop
if we drop if we're gonna choose to drop teletext again what are we adding to the product that makes a marketable
so i would market this product at eighty nine euros and come up
no i know i understand what you say what i'm what
so that's just my question we can keep talking
we can keep talking
work i think the largest portion of the market is just gonna you know they lost the t. v. remote they need another one that'll work with their t. v. they want
you know so things come to my mind is something that's voice activated i know we're getting in this
'cause i think a voice activated i think of
i think of how many times i've lost my remote i can't find it so some
are we gonna put in what makes this thing attractive and it's only
in were coming out with one remote for television only answer
product i don't i really had to say i don't see the market niche for this product at this price i don't
at this price i don't see it and
see it and like i go along with this because this is what
with this because this is what we're given to try to market but i
that should be the design i think
i think technology would be would not in the price range to do it
we don't have the money to do it towards the technology so we should aim
it's a do you have to do it in the box
box so that's up to you than just
does any of the the features that was talking about here are have any implications we make not for the one in terms of just pure functionality
i think all these things are pretty standard i think will
that you know for marketing for me is in
and you can just click
and so the of the twenty five euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price that's what we decided
that's what we decided here
so i would like to have a product that we can still easily so i said inspiration
are cutting edge technology i don't think we're gonna have that these
we're gonna have that these were ideas i was putting together
i wanna make this thing something that i can identify a special in some way so maybe we
we're kind of in the middle of the market but what i'm
but what i'm saying is that the market is ready for i identified new technology but
technology but again because what i see as budget restrictions and limitations i don't know that we can bring any new technology and it's a if
and it's a if we could have a technological something
i have an idea it's and it's kind of
and it's for some people
maybe not a solar remote but instead
or fruit not just for the user design but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as a whole you know you
you know you could have some kind of neat little you know a sexy design for a cradle in the remote itself
idea but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double
it's environmentally sensitive that we can
what i can do is i can look into the how paid and i can look and how much this might increase our costs and
got one of those i'll fantastic i
fantastic i want one of those two i just don't have enough
like being able to operate you know the d. v. d. player and you know the stereo system and all that which is a pretty basic
i'll in my opinion we need to give them the package back they say
they say you go they go that's a fundamental
know that you i don't think it's our place to create a product for that maybe this
i don't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder but to me
do we follow the directives or do we make presentations back and then discuss
can i do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing out right now i don't see it
to disagree though i think our market niches people who need who've lost their remote or
to just wanna run out the store and get a remote and then they're
and then they're gonna look and the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote it does what they need
it does what they need design
and that to get it back then other points it
you have to selling and it's one it's not one be specifically
and it's one it's not one be specifically for that actually t. v.s or whatever
one or all you need to do is know what they do have like some forward record it's all saying
no they've identified the product is not working for anything with television they've
we have done this
limited that's why i say i don't see the market niche for this if
niche but we were all the identify is going for television flip out teletext has like ball we
has like ball we had in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable because there was just
because there was just a television remote i don't
that if you're in the market for this alternate remote you're not gonna go for just a television remote if it can
i have a tendency to agree with you i really do
you i really do that's why i say i class
product they're really question where we create a demand
we're looking for something basic be the
so if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking i think that's in itself and extremely big thing
so if you drop the cost know if you make go to the other side of the cost k. i. when you make it less expensive than all the sudden now we're going into an a new market there are so
there are so we can say low-cost good design beautiful what the data that but what i'm saying
we only have a few minutes left
and that's for the multi functions d. v. c. r. cats shots and
and they have an a little box in the middle and this is
so to me to market this at all a television remote control we have to change can i just it's
we have to have something that would change people's thinking to identify this is advantageous and i don't
and i don't know what that is it's gotta
know what that is it's gotta be low cost or high cost with special design features
we can take it down to your fifteen rather than twenty five and make a little profit margin on it but we're really doing
as everybody so there's i
everybody so there's i think

the remote not design the t. v. so
for example some and it just goes to the shop the ones the replacement but it's possible twenty five euros a
"'cause" we're talking
'cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety five percent a television that are teletext
up if we lose one we need to bring two or three
but as but that the remote is it is used for television so
so if we make the cross over in we're gonna be television on computers in word them are losing the necessity of the remote it's
the and there's other features for example another system so you can pause like t. v. and things it that it just features
it that it just features from the internet from computers that are coming into the t. v.s are under the covers but you still
or other things to think here or that is gonna be more functionality out potentially we can and
i dunno one way or the other teletext was there
is that i think for the pushing us towards year is in terms of thinking of we used to feature prefer system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe i dunno
is that makes sense so
i'm we probably need to move along but my concern
probably should regenerate
but my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product and if i'm
probably should regenerate the time
and if i'm coming in with the with twenty five euros which is made market price v. and what am i going to give these people for this so that's just my question
no this is our that would that the kids would be a teletext and those would be the basic commands
maybe five percent you know and how much
i think that's probably crash more for
it's kind of also
but that's just something i'm trying to find some bells
trying to find some bells and whistles "'cause" we may talk
and we can sell in united states
i don't know what i'm marketing right now so you spoken
can have some i talked about environmentally sensitive maybe we
what i've found is that the projected cost a competitive
and it may even fit in the ergonomics and even
know where the remote is "'cause" you have to put it back there to charge the remote and we can instead
and we can instead of having you know replaceable batteries or just have a power sell that stays there for like for the remote you never
it's know batteries it's environmentally
right i really see but the cost
i that i have to change the end cost because can we do that with that the changing it twelve fifty per product if we can sell more based on that
see i'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product you know let's
kinda remote you have you've
i just don't know about that because in order to do that in order to price it that kind of i think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being
design i think that
if it can control your d. v. d. player and not all if you can't get that all in one alternate remote that just you control your other remotes i'm not gonna buy that seventy five euro remote
basic be the one thing that you said really struck require a three year and that we're kind of course i didn't feel of the product or
feel of the product or actual looking for a large profit the same time where i'd
time where i'd be inclined to go back to a problem i think it's a week let's just cut down a profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here we're selling more
here we're selling more than just the product
we're trying to get main share but real reaction to people who are gonna buy consumer electronics we want people
it's twenty five euros i made market price for a remote
i'd be inclined to see if we can make the design better than any compare will remote for would use in the cost then that's that we really should play it we can take it
i like the idea we have to find out
the the got the problem was that and my name's i just think off and as a consumer but i wanna buy that and i

right now so that's from a marketing perspective i see a lack and
and so we have to go i think in the other direction what are we gonna have
we need a programmable digital signal processors to to take the input from user and translate that into a into electronics signal which we passed to the infrared l. e. d. which you aim at the television which receives that signal
and off switch and
and try to aim for design is a
i think it's possible you should try to you know how to talk with the management about that just you
i don't see the logic i don't see
i'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there how many people actually used every feature that are you
i know we're getting in this and some big money on this thing
and whistles "'cause" we may talk about tell it taking out teletext is like what are we gonna put in what
so we should aim at design
it will increase the cost
but what we can sell this thing because it's know batteries
with television they've identified this product limited that's why
that's why i say i class act i question the marketability of the product they're really question
because i've got remote and i'll take it

know hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did for leading the last meeting as to what it is we're up to now
so he's an agenda
i'll open and you shouldn't all
now or you can all give your presentations we can talk
we can talk about the comments and
and hopefully come to some decisions at four minutes
'cause it to make it had access to teletext
upon
good idea as then try and i and not the
we can satellite dish for a more expensive product that's gonna be
an additional you were maybe not supporting teletext
no i think we can say with certainty know that we are supporting so
no but it to me it's about a choice do we follow the
and we're gonna make you would wanna when men share buy it either being a fantastic product or for walking
and i'll take it doesn't share as take it to definite i don't wanna gold

to really probably and i'm the marketing are looking for something that's that's a cost wanna rather than a fantastic new feature product
but what we're designing or the remote not design
but we don't we know they mean a command for that's
remove it or you know make two separate interface designs
profits because i think it's week is we add cost for things like a for like if we had the voice recognition and things like that i think you know what percentage of the of the market is actually gonna use that maybe
so you spoken when i wrote this i don't know what i'm marketing i just know they
i wanted to talk about who we are as a corporation that word new
you know let's that sell this thing wholesale for fifty euros sixty euros let's make this thing really
make this thing really exclusive environmentally sensitive a high-tech design ergonomics all of this just make just saying

so then have any overall
twenty five euros a selling price we
i think that the last point is probably quite so straight-forward
the way it has to be branded
i don't see it and to me if i'm gonna market a product for beauty for design i'm gonna try to market a much higher price i need to make it special
so what i did is i decided that this needs to be a product in a sense can market itself so what we've
so what we've identified here as our main marketing strategy and is in design we're making

but i think one of the main selling points is it we don't want it to be clunky like this thing here you know
thing here you know we don't wanna big cocker want something that
and then passes that signal on to the infrared l. e. d. and
i need to make it special with a high price tag i don't wanna
i don't wanna make it economically at a competitive i
nay saying we can raise the price twenty percent you know we like

but i'm not attack a minute i just don't see the
innovation i think fits in the what we're talking about here with design are
for a formality for multi-function remote that's a mid market price in a discount right
in a discount right now you can buy "'em" on sale sometimes for about the a team nineteen euro and that's for the multi functions
and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls so
what about the idea that i had with a cradle and

and i'll be easier from in addition not actually giving the whole presentation
the different ones are just the that was sent in the eye for that on from upper management having a few bright idea is to make a noise painful
at four minutes for this meeting so that more
so the double r. will be on or
on the product you can you handle that black

do you all received an email
option see if it's for example trainable one then we just simply having we can up down left right an button or something and eight me too as and future person
remote that then the place we're going to justify that costs is to design to making it a sleek elegant high priced basic remote is that makes
of the good idea as
they do i just wanna say quickly i would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles are

and it would take that
how this have is computers and teletext hell why is one eliminating the need of the other i don't understand
maybe what we're getting two years be the ideal of and connect to the t. v. for example so
so that might play on what we can do
so i said inspiration so having

we're not putting some that's not putting anything in the place of teletext that's a problem
so for keeping it
but i don't think we have that flexibility
it is design as design it's cheap and functionalities basic than twenty five years is probably a high a price for a commoner gardens down standard t. v.s the place
the place remote that then

sees user interface
like at a cradle that is there to hold a remote when you're not using it so you always
so you always know where the remote is "'cause"
i just don't have enough money right now

no the questionnaires can we make this for less than twelve fifty pair
no we have to change it in cost is
i do think there's some basic features that we don't have a lot of other remotes are going to have
want one thing i don't understand is they've given us this package i'll

is the additional points just
what are we gonna have that makes this thing better
so that's that was my reaction is

but there's also the potential for mark it as a market here for a lost so that's for example some
so so what we can go and pump a whole bunch technology in the same because all
t. v. user so it's very good for some people but it's not a league

three presentations and i think bold one or participant number here
you have the power sources in the upper right hand corner there and you can see
we did that should be designed

department that in user interface is also a major component
v. they want something that looks that isn't gonna
that isn't gonna break when you drop it that

and then was the end up using simple functions a little things in
things in most people want one get to amount of actually having to go to the to this to the television into for instance team in their stations there's no need to have
as for what i would recommend for a then the interface design and i will change the colours on the wall but we should go for the user oriented device so

it's kind of also sees user
that's up to you than just to make this box and something that's just extraordinaire
maybe make it in a form would go and we can sell in united

their remote or are broken the remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer to just wanna run
it down it as it is gonna be somewhere that you put it there and then it needs to be at the state of your armchair that
state of your armchair that plays it is only one t. v. user so

it's just when we eliminate getting what do we bring what are
the most costly components are gonna be the chip and

mean i'm the industrial designer
so here's just the basic layout of how the remote would work you have the

and so require some memory as
and and we're also marketing a product that's what i'm saying is a mid range cost product so so

so depending on what we wanna functionality to be the chip could be expensive or could be cheap dependent
dependent on my memory we need in there and like that and what do you know how much power

we have to for you get to a more specific design phase for that
go they go that's a fundamental foundation of what they want and

we are fighting over it was a more fun
i mean i didn't see you cross over in some sense but as

and now all the last time still here recommending the teletext so i'll remove that i but
but i think what they demand and recommendation was less that there's a way that teletext would become outdated rather than we shouldn't have that so i

the thing and all those required other commands with more complexity and more software and
costs and you can look into what kind of affect an increase cost is gonna have on their final numbers

so for keeping it basic level of what we're looking to sell it is it's just being very easy to use looking exceptionally good that's a thing "'cause" we really don't
competitive i want to market it as exclusive so i would market

as for really the case design maybe a come up with more concrete ideas right now is just
right now is just the idea of simplicity and sleek in a skewed did small

like that i think that's gonna be were you're gonna find the biggest you know market share
so we're looking for something that looks good and just works rather than looking for any special features of that

our boss
and not the boss

and it's only for television it's so we
i just know they like i was identified as a that we identify ourselves as a developer as a manufacturer and as a distributed to other wholesalers

i don't know these are just thoughts
these are just thoughts

and you could page the remote if you lose it maybe there's a button on
it maybe there's a button on the cradle

but to me is like kate you actually get out ideas and then let
and then let them look at those ideas nay saying

it for coding in that
for coding in that so i think it's important to remember that this remote has to work with multiple t. v.s you have to selling

rather that it to sell for real reactions attacking
or how does everybody feel

and you shouldn't all that i'll be taking minutes channel meetings as a was

meetings as a was showing to last and and i'll be easier from

for this meeting so that more time than last one

the additional points just wanted to put those and they have to see if you guys had any comments on them

what it what comes up for me is that if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be having no teletext people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext in using teletext and so we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now so

so it's not in criticising the product and all it's just when

i think what walls was my mind but the war

cocker want something that looks and it's fashionable so

so we can have a look at the working design for a participant two parts

so you'll know mean i'm the industrial

and we've some basic components that a remote is gonna need just

gonna need just every remote mean we need some kind of

and that we also need to have that if we wanna universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes it a t. v.s so we need

and you can see that we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all are signal processing and then passes

and that signal is animated and received by the television at the for the transistor so

so those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything

it is would just be considered just a standard the

here we're talking about existing technology that things can

that things can modify their upgraded or the discoveries

this is just the basic layout about that all the components that we are gonna be necessary to have are working remote we can add things in like

we can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition i mean that

do we have an i. d. of course of different components

i don't have any figures right now we have to

but and i think it's significant part of the cost could be the actual casing itself and you know the buttons and things like that i think

and you click on

it's upon

you slide show in the it's got

you guys know we can draw and

what a phone as we want to do fashion and i

do fashion and i think honestly we should keep technology low and just simple and

is a case will cost the same if it looks good or bad

something to do small the big chain two remotes

the big chain two remotes are dieting v. a. v. so

a. v. so we should just go for something that people like to actually look at

and a little more most people will buy a it's televisions and everything for the have a little holes a little functions and everything and

device so simple controls and good ergonomics

so i still think of it cheap enough functionality waste include it really should be in there because

because otherwise we're just going to

going to make it even if it's necessary or not if you're given the choice between the two remote west don't think so without open it really if it

if it isn't more expensive for us to make because it's that is understand it can be operated at the same set of buttons so

right as far as i know

i mean software rise there's really no difference i think

question like in a very beginning it said with the advent of computers is gonna be it's gonna be outmoded teletext i don't

the aiming at saint that you use in a couple years ago teletext be the easiest way to check like for the scandal ridden in the next programme and like that or not

i just i don't see the cross over three computers in television i mean i didn't see you cross

but it's not happen you know a

but you have digital t. v. is already

unless you have all the

a drought and you can you can use your catalogue for example it a family member mean

but you still use it to a teletext or other

i think a lot is proprietary anyways you're not gonna be able to

but still that is an option see if

was there but i we can remove it or you

i don't see a lot you can elimination teletext and just

teletext and just but i'm not attack a minute

and then i in fact

i just don't see the crossover between computers and it "'cause" we're

a communique that back to those guys the and the

euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design something but

that are you know it like these trainable remotes and things like that where you know what it's just so confusing to do a lot to use all these functions work i

it that you know that maybe it's ergonomic it feels good in your hand something like that i think

i think the more bells and whistles we had it's just gonna cut into our entire profits because

now we can talk a little bit more potential in the market and i think presentation of of the

for this guy here

it so some way that i can find my remote lights clapping my hands or something and

lights off

every are our competition that there's got these multiple adaptors where they can use them for their v. c. r.s or d. v. d.s their their televisions in were coming

answer to me we have to make it a really special product i

but i don't see the market niche for this product without some really some something really special identified as unique in the market

i have a question that for the year it does any of

of the meeting or cut the cost of that right

pretty standard i think will be

just get off that you just click anywhere

we're making the most beautiful attractive whatever we decided this so that

so that means we have about seven more minutes ten minutes left

so having something beauty something attractive something that in a sense will sell itself

unless we come up with some new age product as far as the casing is concerned i wanna make

maybe we have a product that can be identified and some way as advantageous in the whole i don't

that word new we're aggressive were competitive we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line so to

line so to me it's about selling that how our identity our corporate identity along with the product

and it's kind of along those lines of environmentally sensitive and it may even fit in

and even kind of address the issue of losing the remote what we're saying that's the kind an issue

we can do is you know that batteries throwing away rose run two batteries like crazy right and

remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle like at

you never have to get go through the go through all these different batteries

i think it's a good opportunity for the user design or fruit

sensitive that we can identify it is a safer product and some form

it in cost is i mean i don't see it anyway

right my reaction is no way

just make just saying the rolls royce of remote controls

everyone's got to if you don't have one

which is a pretty basic function know we use up that out of an additional

want and it's a place you can analyse know that you i

you know we like this idea no but

i'd i have to disagree though i

it's all technologically if i understand it at t. v.s t. v. remote walking exactly the same way that you remotes and d. v. d. remotes all you need to do is

all you need to do is train them to the individual one or all you need to

it's all saying that works with all t. v.s is equivalent to saying that all work with d. v. d.s and things

for this if we if we are going to have a product that work for d. v. d.s v. c. r.s in everything then i can see the market niche but we

so we really can't change that

we want people to eventually see all that's real reaction that's a good make it reliable

or for walking it just being good reasonable price and solid so if

but what i'm saying is right now we're middle market

but we're really doing that to sell the brunt the five minutes left

the five minutes left

for real reactions attacking to make it just it to the more senior people within the company here to get a reaction

i would were talking about the other and now i like it

no but that's the thing i don't think it's necessarily the other end

i don't wanna gold or some wouldn't put it down it as

but it's not a league
