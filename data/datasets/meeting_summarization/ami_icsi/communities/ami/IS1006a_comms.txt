so there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote controls so we
so i would have my own design of the remote control because it seems like

should it be you know these the remote controls where they are would be called a universal word remote control so you
if we want to or universal remote control that we see the p. c. b. for me

so twenty five euro for a remote control
so any of you have experience in remote controls
i know from because that nobody has colour for a remote controlled
a remote controlled always black but this one could
control so you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television then it's the remote
then it's the remote control for the sound system more for your offered you go whatever
or if we should have a target the remote control
but i know screens on a remote controls
control because it seems like just a phone touchscreen remote control if you like

when you get to have the kick-off meeting for the design of for the beginning of the new project remote control for the design for a new remote control and the project manager
so we want to do new remote control has to

controlled by a brain right

so that could be a great to a an application remote

not pretty small a colour
it's always black colour
you can we can change colours not at the
for its own you could change colours
maybe we can change the colour of the accused of three

in fact my daughter likes yellow remote controls we

i think one thing in order of processing this remote control if you remember when people use it to be a bit never find a good but the right place for some reason

but first ten detections you should know what to do it change channels you adjust volume and animals
but process when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five
and that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five
i usually just change channels
because i'm only using three or four channels but
i change channel ideas that

and that's the price we want to that state
that state aim for the price for the remote control we
like three mental states you know what i

so she likes the buttons which make kick so
place for some reason d. v. d. day off button when they want to use do so there's a problem
some i prefer to have the off button that the top right so i
i mean if it's less than three is that we can make it to a light
three buttons you mean
inside but i ask you three
may need more than she should bottom three possibilities
more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time
i go back button that's good i want that

ideas that i want to go to twenty five and then then
that's all i think we have form of idea
and i want you can work on these ideas and try to make

it's a very complex an email and
no screen so it's too complex
that becomes more complex but
complex but you could look at what the other people have used there we go with you i

has to be original trendy and user-friendly
just to try to who's the user interface designer according to
i thought it could be on your screen which we changed depending on the user or even the user some i
what does it and he means and the user
