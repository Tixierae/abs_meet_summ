so we want to do new remote control has to
i'm krista couple of
so whiteboard it is a working great
to talk about money
according to the drawings
so any of you have experience in remote controls
yes we have plenty at home in fact my daughter
in fact my daughter likes yellow remote controls we
we see i may need them to break
unbreakable
colourful maybe
i know from because that nobody has colour for a remote controlled
no that's a good idea
no not so big load

for is that correct
i am not very good day these kind of my favourite
my favourite animal is
she's big number
so she likes the buttons which make kick so

then it's the remote control for the sound system more for your offered you go whatever
or if we should have a target the remote control
size matters
but without and it seems like a lot of this has not arrived

still some kind of like the with so there are phone with the screen that will tell you what no
no screen so it's too complex
too expensive for twelve euro
and maybe not too expensive it's not

and that's the price we want to that state
that state aim for the price for the remote control we
also international market

so that could be a great to a an application remote
remote controls children proof of
children of

aha
too expensive is it

it's quite recognisable
and for a production cost of twelve fifty euro maximum

yes my interface
great next

so twenty five euro for a remote control
we him to do these profit

it's always black colour
a remote controlled always black but this one could

so colour runs that's easy to use size size
no maybe at least more bigger than these days

it is the colour of the
and too expensive

when you get to have the kick-off meeting for the design of for the beginning of the new project remote control for the design for a new remote control and the project manager

and the project manager chris type of love and

i'm first point two were opening then we get used to more than others and

and we speak about this tool would going to design and take to make the project plan some discussion

some discussion and then we took for the next meeting

has to be original trendy and user-friendly

i think the important points we have to talk about our it's functional design it's conceptual design and do you say the detailed design

c. n. and for that to it we're going it to work individually and then have meeting during all day

for favourite animals it's gonna be not my favourite

it's gonna be not my favourite one but the one i can draw and it's gonna

and it's gonna mean you try to

complex

yes that's hard it's my third

read it

it's my third one

or a rabbit for

it's a very complex an email and

and characteristics

characteristics of this animal is dangerous

a kind of a snake cobra

cobra exactly

i'm not pretty small

not pretty small a colour

no it is small corpora

is that the warm weather

i'm krista

it's my t. v. show

see my thesis

so whiteboard

next

next

next to

just to try to who's the user interface designer according to

the it is it a two million and

so i have to click

so they have to be waterproof maybe i think "'cause"

has to be you know they've been truthful

i think "'cause" they eat it and she it could it

but and they need has to be very brothers to because

very brothers to because even if she's not very tall she's the high enough so that when she throw it away it's a

so it has to be the rubber's

unbreakable

of the estimate a doodle or something

what has to be looking

colourful

but for all of the protocol

but this one could be a don't know purple what

it just that but that someone from it's not like

because you stink why not

otherwise you'll know find it

you can we can change colours not at the

not at the lake the phones

lake the phones and these things i at least for children

for its own you could change colours

at least for children like one colour

and it should be really small a time

small also a bunch of sync

no not too much buttons or

should it be you know these the remote controls where they are would be called a universal word remote control so you

control so you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television then it's the remote

colour size

that's all you just think it's better of small then we go

not too small

it is it true for you know and probably late

like a parts right

but what could be different from this from the others i don't know if

maybe we can change the colour of the accused of three

so then it depends you are two

a menu you can easily moulded the frame

i think one thing in order of processing this remote control if you remember when people use it to be a bit never find a good but the right place for some reason

place for some reason d. v. d. day off button when they want to use do so there's a problem

so there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote controls so we
