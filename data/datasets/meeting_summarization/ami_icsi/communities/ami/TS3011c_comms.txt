and we had a talk about all the different components wire in this design these are
these are the things we've looked that's and of course
it's curved in two dimensions you have to imagine
you have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form so it's
which is the same for rubber but it's not something
when you're watching t. v. when you have to make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it's against the wall wanna do with it has
it has to move that's the sense of it and you can store
yes it as come to that later
a flawless think about a scenario where you would use the scroll button
it you buddy means is there's an button integrating the scroll wheel there's no scenario
no i said it's not really a scroll wheel but on their side that the volume button is on the side because
because you grip grab it like this
spongy but it's

and of course use a web to find my information about
we used to it's just it's it is just a box i'm
we have a a curved one it's
it would be very new but it's kind
onscreen display
but what about markets want colour false designs so if we use
no but they and that was an l. c. s. i. d.s
that a new thing we have to skip that
it and if you take the double curved then you can that's you can only use the rubber buttons you can as you scroll wheels so i
the most infrared remote controls don't have to be point that at all
if you take your hand before it it won't work but you
work but you can point it and just the other one
it depends on your walls actually if you have

because it works with infra-red
that's quite strange
we'll come to that later like i think
i think we can email is immediately start with the individual presentations the programmes you made
and the feel of the material has to be spongy
but personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control but
maybe some soft material or something but not real spongy
it might not be it shouldn't be too hard
it shouldn't be too hard it may be
it may be rubber or
there's no way you can integrate l. c. d. displays there's no

it's very funny in this
but it's your calculator as a solar panel and hand dynamo
come to that later and we of course
volume
am i this is my volume button and i can either on the side or the side
about the components and just the hardware we have
i suggest we use the sensor sample the sample sensor and sample speaker we do with the regular chip
i think k. it "'cause" as the advantage of
and the scroll scroll wheels

ease of use it is important but innovation
but innovation is more important and
just one slide back now
doesn't look at all any t. v. can view it did it on the on screen
no i don't think you need it
my conclusion
my conclusion unfortunately the market is decide as a little older than i thought
so i don't think we should use to dynamo thing or the kinetic thing it

but it's easy for me to see what you of wrote down so i could can
like cell phones which exchangeable cover
a bit it's the one the possible can gave away the very
so ease of use
if the if you have a watch you
which is just a piece of material on the remote control which transfer those lights energy into electricity the user interface controls
no rubber with colours

point don't know
but when reach yes you have to
so in that case of the volume button on the sides a of remote control would be perfect
to me but i think that's the voice recognition thing that we are thinking about
if we want to use the scroll wheels we need the regular version and if we don't
the do we want a curved the design or

the third meeting
my method
the older group a step further dark colours simple shapes from the material but
it's quite interesting
i'm thinking about the banana a telephone telephone from siemens the yellow rubber telephone it's a rubber
it but you use it on the couch

i have some points i would like to some issues that would like to point out
first of all if you make minutes yourself as i like sebastien those could to put them on the shared folder
sell i
a cable go back to that slide the
you use a mute you repeat can use
i like the scroll wheels idea

a shame they just want something colourful not specifically an apple as a remote control something
have have a look for a for information about it but i
the u. i don't think you need display especially
so if we use titanium
need a regular chip you cannot use think so
i think so if you stick

but since we're going to cost rating on the young group
way too much i think for our goal
but if you're watching a movie how many times you take the remote control in and if the
but that's the same with a solar cell that's anything
yes i think it's more robust it's more
robust it's more it's more functional

the material but we're since we're cost reading room the younger group
what we important things in clothes
as it's something to do with that the natural feeling also do you think
it might but personally
because this is how you keep it

the fancy look-and-feel
could you do your presentation
i don't know it really have much to add a
that's one possibility
so that's the voice recognition item we were searching for this sample

to add on the but it's information in these
it might attract the young often
but is done before the any
and there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker which
version which is a bill little bit more costly if we want to use

i don't think you can compare the little bit with the big ray image you have in your presentation the big remote control something like that but it's quite
advanced and it's quite daring to use i think and
we can use plastic which
you really have to make in like winding up your i'd
the old people like wood

are there any pre discussion questions
i think it might be smart to look at that's an information first because
and that they want spongy material
but i bet i understood that the market is different so

then the decision on the remote control concepts and
and the closing forty minutes
findings
a sec is a could you go to

and thirty five
i've seen it but
if you have a watch you have the kinetic idea know what's also you
so we can save on the batteries and

it's kind of it's kind of all organic so that's very
and what i was thinking about maybe we should make very light to but a great
but i'll go into the deeper in my presentation
of use because we have an easy interface and all the other

do you need to change anything on it because otherwise
these things so that's a limitation
any it makes a computer sound mute and then goes

let's things have some we change again
believe it if you have what we've already said the grip a places in the remote control you have your hand on one place on a remote control so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb so in that case of
if you have a have smoothed walls it probably you're probably right but

i think you should passion for your
it looks that's a banana you have to fruit you
the light blue and it's also a yellow

punish
so you can get a really good grip on it so you don't
and to add on

so i could can and use that and in the report
maybe menu integrate some functions
it's a bit a remote right

forty minutes total for this sell
and that fancy look-and-feel is even more important and some
and some fashion watchers found out that the young target group like fruit and vegetables in their clothes shoes and furniture and that

so what do you think when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing shoes but they are a remote controls also
we can use ward and titanium and
i've chosen the more battery with solar cell solution for the energy it's more

but like dark colours you said and
i know it's not really a scroll-wheel no
c. d. displays there's no way you can integrated scroll wheels because

i suggest that the corporate colours are great and yellow i hadn't
the kinetic thing it is it's possibility is more sense
because you will save all your batteries but

this an example of what they would like but since we're going to
i had a talk with our manufacturing division and
use and these chips incorporate all the logic and hardware does need to send it to send signal we have a simple regular

you can make if you've very colourful ones and a very traditional call cover
so i made a really simple for us shape on in the powerpoint but we could make
but it's not something we can use ward

you have to fruit you have to colours we have to simple design
yes i've seen it
it's new so it might attract

important but technologies twice as important and what was
but it's kind of a rate roll worst i know i think i
i but this is quite interesting

yes a pen
it's good to sum up the things we already thought about
yes but that's possible to have

so it's easy in your hand it
think the scroll wheels i also have some information about a two i
which is a bit cheaper

in these interface we can have a high-tech but voice recognition and the fancy colours and and so on and still have to ease
so is that the voice recognition you can program like thirty where'd you can controls on that
if we want to use the l. c. d. display really need the advanced version which is a bill

and still have to ease of use because we
and all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and one
but i and i don't think the scroll

so it's a little more advanced in its shape and
but it's quite it's advanced and
and forties casings we have different types of finishing we can use plastic

we cannot use the titanium on the double curved cases and these
and these latex cases that's just a plastic ones won't the lower the use of solar cells as energy so which source which brings
source which brings me to the different energy sources

this is quite interesting there's
and it makes it different from the traditional devices on this market so
we have to note if you want to use these rubber double curved get a case you must use used by should have pushbuttons there's no way

and hand dynamo
but you know from your own watch you watch use is a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of energy then the shaking of
all the sony telephones use it for example for volume no i

and we of course that the traditional solar power which is
the user interface controls
wheels and these scroll wheels can also be integrated with buttons so

i'm looking for a way to to make it a little different than the traditional ones so maybe
the any other devices like at telephones and are radio pocket radios we use this
and it's been done years

scroll wheels because it's all curved there's
it's all curved there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate these things so
and then you piece of this action with which you believe it is you use a mute

was an l. c. s. i. d.s at this is what this is my personal preference but i bet i understood
these scroll wheels i think they can be handy so
it's very logical

right but if you have carpets on the wall which are natural of mean friends probably do have then that it might be a bit more of a
all lights good at sort
so it has it's easier

hello sebastian
that's what the thinking goes on

you hit home is the p. m.
it's not it's done before yes

it's that low again always late point don't
an escape skip the l. c. d. part i don't think it

people welcome back
if you do not make me it's no problem but it's easy

the second thing i was that was thinking to myself i have this little remote control and talking to it but it still need to points to the television because it
so maybe we should think about would finish

just press the button it works
a could you go to the previous slide because i'm

so we watch too much spongeball
so send them

one example given what's this so
it's more reliable it's

so a shame they
and it's the colourful it looks that's a banana

no i the younger group likes a more colourful but
and click it should mute and the device

and colouring is important and soft materials
so if you stick with the simple as straightforward and not curve design and it's too dull i don't think they are

ease of use important but
and then goes to the mute function

the previews i deserve voice recognition and the round buttons for the channel programming and volume a few
it's too dole

a few interface i find an internet so are these
with maybe a channel selector

are these are both with with a voice recognition but they're very as
which is a little cryptic to me but

so i suggest i couldn't i
this sample sensor requires and regular chip i fault

work but then didn't load the information so
doesn't user

a great i mean this is how you hold a remote control
maybe it's an a different

it's for your fingers
and we also have double scroll buttons which are just

so you don't have to at a much pressure to it's
so we don't really have the kind of button we had in mind thing or and the last meeting the thing with the rounds of the four

you walk and
so i think you have a problem when you're watching a movie and you haven't move the remote a remote control in the in an amount of time any wanted to switch the channel or something

the shaking of your body which is all was every actively make body shake it charges its but
like might not work so

work so that's something you have to keep in mind
so but maybe there's a possibility come to combine it with traditional batteries so

and all the wise use the batteries
because i the voice recognition feature you can seems quite if a lot of power

of course we have the pushbuttons and
and we also have scroll wheels and

and d. indicators we have the l. c. d. displays which means
and if we don't want to use any of these more sense functions we can keep with a simple a chip which is a bit cheaper

me them maybe menu
yes but it uses two separate buttons

what about integrating a scroll bar on this side
but i don't think information in the u. i don't think

there's no scenario way you use at the button in the scroll-wheel you just use
you just use the wheel

do it what do you think about a scroll bar the scroll wheel
is more sense but i and

we have three types of chips we can use and
and it can be implemented with the regular chip

in the voice recognition you say i were you can program words like volume up of newt that's a mute
so that you said

but did we already decided on the display
i don't think they are customers will like it and

otherwise it will not too advanced or
it's in some way it can give is in that sense because you

so with these to be rubber
the younger people like soft material

what about the issue i addressed at the beginning of the meeting the voice function we with the infrared issue because it's
it's i can imagine it's very goal to talk to a device with you have two points to another device it's very

that has to be some pointing it but
it depends also on your

because otherwise all already open it

it's much changes

maybe you've got new information i like a less time

i didn't know no i don't know only the same information

i believe me said ten tell is with this as in the control room

i see some interesting

possibility

i think the agenda for now are there

we'll have your individual presentations then the

because i understood there are some significant changes in the market situation

how surprising

because i'm taking minutes on it

the field machines is spongy

you said and

and i suggest that the corporate

rubber or

and like the older group like from a materials but that doesn't

i think we should use soft material

and make it call for

so we could provide both for the young and you'll what they like

it's a rubber cover and

it's the siemens say see twenty five a bit it's

dunno and so on but i can imagine

the important findings are innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group and

soft materials

important and what was it more important

so that's the most important thing for our customers

add a because most of things we already said in the previous the discussion

but they're very as far as an a very high-tech and just or weird shape so i suggest

i couldn't i had a small mark up for signed on the close eye but it didn't

but we could make it around to an oval remote control a yellow

it shouldn't be too slots too slippery so

what did he have something like the siemens phone it's rubber so it's

there are there also remote controls who have a little shape than a way you can put your fingers and so you can get

to it's a lot easier so

integrates at the medically

that because there are a song possibilities in some in possibilities

about casing we have three different casing possibilities we have the uncurved

have the uncurved or flat case that's the most common remote can control form we used to

i don't have any pictures of this thing

and we have an even more advanced a shape which is curved

which is curved in three denis i don't think you can

which is very slippery and maybe

and maybe not so but you can give it any colour

but you can give it any colour

and we cannot use

we even seem to have handed and dynamos for powering our remote controls you really have

it would be very new to the market but

there's also a kinetic energy supply so

and you can store the energy in there anything

i think if i can hook onto that the kinetic thing is very funny i mean the

i mean the solar arrays of course it's but it's

its but the problem here is that it's supplies at the very little amount of kinetic energy so

and mine doesn't have kind of kinetic energy used kinetic energy and all the wise use the

buttons so it's just like a mouse you can score one

you can score one you can also put

which means you can watch in a display or which channel you have chosen or something like that often the amount of volume which is currently and

we can just make four points buttons in a form of around

i don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll wheels i'd

i can see at any a scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it

and that's possibility but

so maybe i that's something you to need to think about do it what

it's been done years ago and

ago and i don't see it anywhere now so maybe

so send

we have a simple regular an advanced chip and there is something

you can i have some information about it in the voice

you program it you musically you give and and action to it's that's really the mute function and

and when you speak in the remote control it's repeats you're saying so

that's the sample sensor so if you say mute

so if you say mute it's a nude again and then

and then it what i believe it is

it performs the action

you repeat can use any it

especially when we have to look at a cost i don't think it doesn't look

i thought the market would like something sort of titanium casing but they

but they seem to like natural so

reliable it's cheaper so i don't

but i and i think you should combines with batteries otherwise

it's maybe a bit too flashy to

i think we should skip the titanium and and we should to use

and we should to use woods or something like that

a rabbit the old

these scroll wheels

but they really need a regular chip you cannot

else we already need a regular chip for the sample that's as we know

i think this is the best of two walls

yes because the walls the reef like the infrared light so

it's easier

yes that's an escape
