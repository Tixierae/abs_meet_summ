i'm thinking about the banana a telephone telephone from siemens the yellow rubber telephone it's a rubber
no rubber with colours
colourful rubber
only i'd yellow or but it's into the rubber

when you use the buttons that would all be made of rubber too so
or we could use plus two buttons in the rubber
but the fronts on which the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber i mean
so if you want a spongy feel you need to to make it buttons all of rubber

it's a rubber cover and
we have decided we want to use the rubber

and we also have scroll wheels and
think the scroll wheels i also have some information about a two i
i don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll wheels i'd
scroll wheels because it's all curved there's
these scroll wheels
these scroll wheels i think they can be handy so
and the scroll scroll wheels
i like the scroll wheels idea
the scroll wheel i mean you could place

the second thing i was that was thinking to myself i have this little remote control and talking to it but it still need to points to the television because it
then the decision on the remote control concepts and
a shame they just want something colourful not specifically an apple as a remote control something
but personally i would like to a spongy as a remote control but
but we could make it around to an oval remote control a yellow
a great i mean this is how you hold a remote control
there are there also remote controls who have a little shape than a way you can put your fingers and so you can get
and when you speak in the remote control it's repeats you're saying so
the most infrared remote controls don't have to be point that at all

which is just a piece of material on the remote control which transfer those lights energy into electricity the user interface controls
the user interface controls

have the uncurved or flat case that's the most common remote can control form we used to
so in that case of the volume button on the sides a of remote control would be perfect

they always have the scroll wheels that's the speaker the speech recognition the rubber the fancy colours
the scroll wheel yes the voice recognition we

wheels and these scroll wheels can also be integrated with buttons so
i can see at any a scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it
it you buddy means is there's an button integrating the scroll wheel there's no scenario
there's no scenario way you use at the button in the scroll-wheel you just use
it and if you take the double curved then you can that's you can only use the rubber buttons you can as you scroll wheels so i
scroll-wheel but there will be so on additional buttons i and

what about integrating a scroll bar on this side
do it what do you think about a scroll bar the scroll wheel
no i said it's not really a scroll wheel but on their side that the volume button is on the side because
c. d. displays there's no way you can integrated scroll wheels because

if we want to use the scroll wheels we need the regular version and if we don't

what did he have something like the siemens phone it's rubber so it's
i thought the market would like something sort of titanium casing but they
the case and rubber with one curve user
but you can scroll is work with one one curved case
start with the casing
what about so the finishing of the case
what i said in in the first a discussion the digits six on the bus and it will disappear when it's from rubber
but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case
what about making this rubber i'm making this plastic

we cannot use the titanium on the double curved cases and these
and we also have double scroll buttons which are just
a flawless think about a scenario where you would use the scroll button
we have to note if you want to use these rubber double curved get a case you must use used by should have pushbuttons there's no way
work they cannot work with double curved has this

i believe me said ten tell is with this as in the control room
believe it if you have what we've already said the grip a places in the remote control you have your hand on one place on a remote control so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb so in that case of

but if you're watching a movie how many times you take the remote control in and if the
so i think you have a problem when you're watching a movie and you haven't move the remote a remote control in the in an amount of time any wanted to switch the channel or something
