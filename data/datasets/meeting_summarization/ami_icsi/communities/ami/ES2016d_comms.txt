we might at some more underneath here maybe
maybe give it to reform i mean you're supposed
reform i mean you're supposed to hold it like that but
i'd say a bit smaller would probably be if
on the fourth one how about the problem
yellow bright yellows how to use but
think that was we could mentioned
it is quite bright and
maybe in the middle and
but if we do go with the speech recognition then it there are skilled is a quite a bit
which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television
i don't know the way are that innovative state the truth
but how many remotes to use it like it's not so many
because that's all i got what these parts the grapes and perhaps the backside the bottom that underneath on the back
to fold and
so lots of four at most
now i just "'kay" to calculate think it's a
it's a six

feel that was twice as important as anything else
they like fruit and vegetables and the new styles
so we were time i try to incorporate those into our prototype
they wanted limited buttons and simplicity then
a two part remote which was what we're actually looking at and then
luckily we are going to find out
five four
four
did we make it simple for new users
like down and things that should be negotiated
but there's not a lot of yellow there's not a lot yellow course that wasn't
and last layer do we
no i don't know us and i press it
is there like a scale that we have to get

so out how to how we could how the economics of it
through and just simple functions would be but almost identical so i bought by
the controls
because we've put down some for controls are the most common to a channel volume and
annoying alarm or something
as much as it's made of them
if you're fashion is but is carmen miranda you better

in the middle done thoughts on that
seventeen a balance
seven is
two point four
i don't do nothing
does that work
twelve and a half euros what was the cost us

soon as a
soon as a yes
or we'll see what we need to have on to the criteria for the evaluation then we'll go to
how about the problem of a remote being easily last one of the number one
alright so the top and the t. s. can read that are not like
energy source there's a four five six categories we have energy source

we also had the kids remote for the simple idea
you could add an extra feature actually
we could do that but that's nothing we have thought of so far
true i mean just as whistling for indicating is you have a cheap so i got that
i stick it on t. v. viewers

thing i suppose with the scroll on the l. c. d.
he and he it's based
it's based on this anti theft technology for two cases and we have one piece that's
you can go a long time ago and that's two
two point four two right

and then we'll do a group of valuation the prototype the little calculate
the little calculate the average score to see how we done
so if they think that what is out there is oddly then yes i would say most athletes
was not show up
i think the colour is to track to

we have an wanna do is two features we gonna say
let's add one of those features and say yes
somewhere have that no one but
that we technologically innovative
yes thousand dollars but we have a job

i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting
that's simple on off switch
on this meeting we see that very
title of things could happen

and made a decision on what we were going to use to make a remote
have what we're make for the prototype so
so i'm gonna get my remote controls with
it's gonna hurt us

i think it's pretty important so you don't have to fiddle
so you don't have to fiddle with that
what seven being false we did that to you that
just shows that way

this is our last
we looked at at the trends we had that
but i think we still decided not to go with that then we looked

this is our last meeting
should be a lot to that but what about should but suppose and
just use to find it's lost my cassette that

then we'll go to the finance and see if we fall within the budget
own remote looking at other devices
the ipod we really like the look at that

and then we can finish about for that with any changes that we did make a or
menus is that a simple buttons
the actual thing might as

and a spongy feel so we
bought by that we want each of the channels that with all the way through channels volume
volume up and down and then to

so first all just discuss some of the criteria that i found just based
just based on the past to train reports that i was looking at earlier and then
i'm was that was my name's we have

which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a
it's all just all them technology or i
but for remotes

see minutes from d. last meeting
scrolling through and select in a few

then we looked at d. components
take my own criteria and half of the value that case where

so i'm going to leave it that and which you guys
and then the other ones just a massive showing for it

prototype do you need
kind

can try to plug that in there but
the usability

the usability lab the groups so that's
it's and you can you smell of having like that but

of it all the controller would be done with the scroll wheel
the scroll wheel to use imaginations a bit and they say

a simple buttons to showbiz and see if we had have been that's
on the colour but it definitely is

but just if you grab it take it from somewhere so
yes think about the buttons like you to

so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints the we heard from that users who were interviewed earlier so
we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale

so for the first one we need to decide if we solve the problem of the users to complain about them ugly remote
i think it's it definitely different than anything else up there so

that angular
very non committal for

about that i mean i much prefer something like brash scroll with that form but
something more modern to go out a

and i so do you think since we this was that a sign criteria that you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle done
we have some spongy

maybe in the middle and therefore from
i mean you know it will losing things in those things that people can lose them in any way jim baker walk

but if we eliminate to the fact that you know it's impossible to get it's not gonna be lost and
with speech recognition which of course may even be changed depending on budget

so what that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to hide so we have one
to hide so we have one piece you have to go somewhere behind your stick "'em" behind your t. v. and the other

the way we're gonna force to take that colour
if it's gonna hurt

if we had at the screen mean factor there we go up
fifty percent you kidding

i can do that without a calculator
read that are not like you said my glasses on but

and then we'll have a prototype present a shouldn't

then we will to an evaluation

then we'll do the evaluation and

did make a or a play with them off alright mine

we had that would be fashion trends that people want a fancy look and feel that was

then we looked at the the method for coming up with our own remote

and then there is talk of speak speech recognition and becoming more predominant and easier to use but i think we

the materials for the case the different energy sources the different types of chips

the best that discussion

do you need this

a bit and they say we have a sense of d. screen like when you go through and just

and then to access the more complicated functions shop that you press i go to the menus is that

i dunno we could use of force that blue-based

that blue-based should be a lot to that

that's right it's as simple

it's as simple as it would make it is anything else was

that's what we have that's plastic

have that's plastic a little rubber

plastic a little rubber we might

it from somewhere so you have

you never know but if we should look

you have some rough exactly

know but if we should look left and right and that as of

like you to put either one of them on either side there

but what's the button

all to click on off button that's so

probably be if we wanna play with that or they're

and present

done

kind of a banana

know whether or not they were falling to the costs is another thing i suppose with

of do you have a marketing presentation of words

you guys are gonna how we do it in the evaluation of the criteria

and one is going to me and true that with the actually achieve that what seven being

it still has your traditional black

i'd say because the ergonomics the form and yes that's definitely more beautiful than the average have a colour

have a colour we don't have the same that

some people might so

that has been know that has been dictated pretty much by the company so

so to answer that honestly i would rather say like we have not solve the problem completely maybe i really remote because the colour is that we definitely you can say

out a moderate colour to go with the modern for

it's different you know want your three feeds you wish l. c. d. disk display in your living room that thing from the wall to be controls on one but

the second one did we make it

that's very intuitive i think

the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users

on the fourth

one of the number one complaint

something that began that yellow you just don't lose any more

it's bright

it's bright yellow bright yellows

but if we were so if we would that speech recognition that can maybe issues that's only for the finding think that was

so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could

my cassette that and then you lose them so you know some reason he's not gonna fall

he's not gonna fall like a rectangle looks like down and things that

jim baker walk away with it and then you lost it

some sort of proximity you

we have one piece that's that actually a lot of standard piece that's not speaking to cut

speaking to cut cost much

pre that you don't next time is that is

so your remote put all on your somebody stole you change your television and then offer that

then offer that without taking the beautiful remote control

from idaho have here

but we have a job

not so many

i would say we're probably a four

spongy material

we you have that kind of sort of

a one no one would be the whole thing

possibly even a five

do we put the fashion in electronics

the recent fashion as a rather displayed and in the l. c. d. and the way he operated and perform on the colour but

first monday in

and i was like two point four two

i press it

and what is d. acceptable criteria

no it just all made

can we get to do the budget numbers

no that you're gonna have a budget

so you can go a long

time ago and that's two point four to access education

not too shabby

we want fifty percent profit on this meeting

that's a tough the

on but so we've got the energy source there's
