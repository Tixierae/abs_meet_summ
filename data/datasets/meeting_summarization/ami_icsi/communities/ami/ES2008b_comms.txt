and then we have to make a decision on a remote control functions i will disclose
need to stop i considering what remote control actually is it's a
sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote controls
but as a lot of features that are missing from that remote control so we've got to
the remote their own remote controls
their own remote controls like that
like some t. v.s they have a sort of a sliding screen on the remote control that hides
i suspect a remote control does think about it

so this is are working design
is are working design presentation i have a pet
though the think about working design as they what we're trying to do
because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design so the
that's pretty much it for the working design
so in there we have technical functions presentation working design presentation and the functional requirements least

how do we have to go about designing a new television remote control
on the left to we've got it's an engineering based design for a remote control so it's

weapons you have like you have numbers new remote control you
say like it at a hundred a new remote control in this

also just the number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna
button them i dunno i'm gonna buy a new remote

for just that there's too many buttons it just needs
they might be overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology

the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use make that
for me to sit at a drastic difference between those two remotes
it's right now what we're doing is deciding on just the remote itself so
person than ever not doesn't have to have like two remotes one that has
like it might be necessary for a t. v. but not for the remote you know seems a
you can't even be bothered to pick up the remote

using a remote control is quite subjective experience
as i said before remote controls all subjective different

that thing to do is to come up with the design specifications we need to know
what we're trying to do is working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus can fulfil its function
working sanders figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function what
it's the parts of the working design they need to be figured out and
why we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan in the new design

and different people sort of prefer different things
different people want one different things
because i think sort of it will appeal to different people that

the younger people did it
is something that definitely appeals to younger people

he could have a crap remote taking
a crap remote taking with their t. v. that's

this is our functional design meeting
it's all the functional design objectives we need
we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled that extra functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working design how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function
focusing on the designers people specifically said that it's not remotes were ugly seventy five
so in some sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
a but it would also in into the design of the product
how we can improve on that designs that sounds and
good that's ergonomically designed
so the chip that i think he in this designing it's gonna be crucial

we should remember that remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using
when the users using a remote control hear she expects the buttons to be in certain places so in some
critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls the converse the electrical energy into data which then
the chip which is also controlled by the user so you have
so you have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip or

so you have your energy source your user interfaces controlling the chip that should also use
and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work or infrared
a lot we need a chip that works with the user interface that isn't too complicated
