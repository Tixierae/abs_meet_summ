and also putting on them in the shared folder so
and what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume people are
people are so is that like change the channel but that sixty five percent terrain and our views so we really
much more infrequently in power which complicate what's going on
the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use make that
user interface right
could so find out what people think of them
what can we do with the current state of technology as it is the second is
a but it would also in into the design of the product
and they are designed to sort of like this you have your energy source
which then brings energy or information to the chip which
down and there's all the special buttons

this is our functional design meeting
talk about the new project requirements that just received and
make that you know something make an audio setting is then given it much important and visibility on the remote as a minute channel changing that to use a lot more often and
that thing to do is to come up with the design specifications we need to know
it's just got it's essential functions of the t. v. changing the channel play stop volume it would be a lot
it would be a lot quicker to learn to use it but
but as a lot of features that are missing from that remote control so we've got to
that was just on the company website
not filters out and
of the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
so you have your energy source your user interfaces controlling the chip that should also use

source and talk a little bit about functional requirements that people satisfied when they last i
i think that no shared a quite a bit rate anyone wants to work
so it's a communication device we
as you mentioned things like voice recognition but at the price a
isn't too complicated
so that you're not wearing your remote around and having to
so what's our corporate image like it's
'cause that would affect the way that we market
lot of we've got price limit of the twelve and a half euros to produce it and i wonder
to produce it it's
why are we aiming for a technological advancement everything were

found what they analyse people's desires and needs focusing on the
focusing on the designers people specifically said that it's not remotes were ugly seventy five
it sends a message to the television saying
using a remote control is quite subjective experience
and different people sort of prefer different things
it's the parts of the working design they need to be figured out and
will they have a short amount of time
why we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan in the new design

that's pretty much it for the working design
nothing on my screen
so i think was gonna have the money to buy the parts that or
i wanna be given any other numbers working on in terms of age later but
later but if that sort of the on the quality that we have that it's about the age then we would wanna stick between fifty and the right range
now those are that old

it's their agenda today
their agenda today just to
talk about did you look at the
did you look at the minutes i emailed them to you

it looks like a white kind of or thereabouts draw
right source and talk
and we need a reliable and clear infrared signal so
it's gonna be twenty five euro remember so

because they're used much more infrequently in
change the volume
space is kind of similar to a very basic weapons
and that people who don't wanna have or a look at them never even have to see that and if

and in order for us to one over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like that
what it looks like that it has a fancy appeal and
because but that's been taken over by the entrance we're not
can pull out of sight

working sanders figure out what you need to make it sell this practical function what
c. ready tidy right let's see lucy
is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or
it's right now what we're doing is deciding on just the remote itself so

critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls the converse the electrical energy into data which then
which then goes to the infra-red so
hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way it's the
say like it at a hundred a new remote control in this

i think of a every time the
that's fine
requirements and we have a couple new requirements that i was just you know for it
itself so it will probably be sold separately twenty five euro by itself

so then i will talk about a general object it's an have your three
an have your three presentations talk
simplicity in fashion

i will disclose was
it's all the functional design objectives we need
which i kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control like it might be necessary

three presentations
that old specific for speech recognition are we gonna
recognition are we gonna use that as whatever functions

i don't know how to play that
just a little presentation it's the
how do we have to go about designing a new television remote control

i don't know anything beyond what the anti means but
but that's but it's really a be used as i think also
and found that the desire for voice recognition was inverse be related to age so

also be did some questions on voice recognition and found that
certain frustrations that i think that we could try to take into consideration and with our design that being
a good one of the cardio

r. s. i. and i was hoping someone might be a wheel and for me as to what r. s. i. it's because i don't
so that we not it's completely shocking people but
in the analysing these we can consider what things what's good about them out what things they get

so i think that's something that you might wanna think about the idea of an l.
i can tell that would turn these things
the t. v. c. ready tidy right

the idea of an l. c. d. screen was brought out although they didn't have
out although they didn't have any details on a people's problems of them out were so i thought some
that hides all the complicated buttons so if

economic we need to find a balance between features and price
i were also gonna or like your question
otherwise becomes too complex to wanna get this out

control so it's one has got lots of buttons it's
team make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted to port it's practical function then
i think it's a lot like to do with battery but that's

but i think that's why companies like apple have you might lot of progress
or had a certain preferences for example
select other than just media but code how is it mean you can

how do i play
the it's read above draw
because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work don't know

the tree thingy if it's where the
but i that's were still an early stages
what we're trying to do is working designers figure out how the operating the apparatus can fulfil its function

then i think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task a step really so
so the findings that i got very of just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that d. information is projected to the receiver and
receiver and in my opinion infrared is the best way to do that "'cause"

i think it's frozen he
a lot we need a chip that works with the user interface that isn't too complicated
are we adding this that

far but we're not gonna work teletext because
advancement everything were talking about is ease of use and simple on that doesn't
and simple on that doesn't necessarily mean more technology in fact we could use

we're not gonna them and to decide we're not gonna work with that
like it might be necessary for a t. v. but not for the remote you know seems a
it's yes pretty it's pretty high-tech

so all my powerpoint and that
around and having to get frustrated and go

we put the fashion
we put the fashion in electronics it's

just to time
time that to you know

i'm gonna do the opening talk about
so our target group were saying fifteen to thirty five

should we go in order you just do that
if we're gonna say that function fashion we put the fashion in electronics and you automatically i think the sort of younger group that's was gonna be attracted to this

alright my screen down
i mean we can't really do anything charlie work this

and then you have to press function f. eight it's i think it is
and there's a big john after

i think or fifty percent of the people mention that was the biggest frustration and you or are
you or are so frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and i think that ties

so i sort of a couple time of tape ten people do not like that
is are working design presentation i have a pet

looking and they need people specified problem right now is that people's remote or not matching the operating behaviour or people are only
showing up already

are some like that but something for us to consider also just the
also just the number on that bus it more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna

so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that
the television saying change channel change the volume

i'm gonna talk about the technical functions design of the remote control
we need to know what a final product is gonna be like so we need

a how it works and what the end
what the end user is gonna want from this product

so in some sense we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
but i think within that there is also the investment should use novel idea is a buttons

a buttons to make something that's got a little bit different something that stands out
also in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities a device

to do is there you know it's got for the backwards up down channel numbers volume freeze frame it's
it's fully featured and

one on the right is a lot more basic it's just got
those are useful for me to

so we've got to find out find a way of striking a balance between the two
it does everything that i needed to as

different people want one different things
it's got big buttons for doing the things i do most often changing the volume changing the channel it does everything

that simple it's easy to use
the remote their own remote controls

as i said before i'm quite lazy i don't wanna walk
lazy i don't wanna walk across the green just to adjust my television also want something that

fashion and should know
how everyone say that which includes

it's read above draw the
though the think about working design as they what we're trying to do

because i wasn't able to find everything i need it but i that's
and we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also

the best way to do that "'cause" you don't need a saline so that's
we have to be careful that doesn't impede it the chip transmitting information but

so the chip that i think he in this designing it's gonna be crucial
and really it all comes down to the user because they're the

because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design so the
so the components that we find here are the energy source you know the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip which converts the data at the user that's controlling the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver do you

so you have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip or
the chip or some other one is true

no let's just get back to my schematic a
or is it something that comes with the television "'cause" that would affect

right so you have your energy
that should also use the energy and the chip

energy source people don't wanna be changing it a lot we need
it's so it's like fifteen to thirty five but i think that's a good idea i wanna be given any

get frustrated and go to it by hand that's
a don't know what else you could put a number to make it technologically the end of select other than

on that we have to keep in and in mind as you're creating this we didn't
it and i wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many of a compromise

over by the entrance we're not gonna worry about right or not but
what's works

than others
and you just type numbers to get a different ideas and it gives

weapons you have like you have numbers new remote control you
like some t. v.s they have a sort of a sliding screen on the remote control that hides

different ideas and it gives you information nicely of a boring like what's on t. v. next and share prices and i can
lottery numbers and sports colours

but if you're see the t. v. saying i go to page one sixty on c. fax now that's what they're talking to
it's pretty old technology it's a

so we want something that looks good
can be visible down the line

or at maybe some buttons could be yellow but we can play
but we can play around a little bit

for example that that older people didn't really care for voice recognition the
to see that and if you like to get the instruction manual it comes at the end you just only when really going on or even know what that those things can go out and you're happy

it mean you can bulk really great and some of the same
and some of the same a phnom button them i dunno i'm gonna

in fact we could use it could mean not if
they might be overwhelmed with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology

their own remote controls like that
so if you wanna do something complicated like program your television or teaching it then you open up this little hat was like the screen down and there's all the

more complicated once
i think that's a good idea

switch the quality of the chair
the quality a quality of all the components really i mean

minutes i emailed them to you and also putting on

and then we have to make a decision on a remote control functions i will disclose

was that in this meeting up actually twelve thirteen we have forty minutes

we have forty minutes so

we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled that extra functions design what effect the apparatus should have and the working design how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function

you got any what are you choose

i think you might have to disconnect euros

have as we bleep like just to someone

models of those

eight it's i think it is and yellow

is it plugged in all the way in

all the way in screw it in them

i think it's have to push it in really hard

or attached and then

i don't know if you as are able to get access to the report that was a minor on

that was a minor on the on line is

i real reaction and that's market research they had a hundred

they had a hundred subjects and the usability lab and

and they watched watch t. v. and record

and record the frequency that they use particular buttons and the relevant the polls buttons hired

seventy five percent of the a hundred subjects know that and that they are

more importantly though eighty percent of that they would be willing to pay more for a fee and see you're looking remote i don't know

to age so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition whereas the

whereas the older people in noun like sixty in about the segmenter sell did that really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition

people also had certain frustrations that

that being people frustrated with losing their remotes i think

and i think that ties that's what you're saying go for just

for just that there's too many buttons it just needs

buttons it just needs to be easy to use it also

it also mentioned something called r. s. i. and i was

repetitive strain injury

repetitive strain injury

like that the repetitive you say yes "'cause" the strain

or people are only using ten percent of the buttons that they have offered to them on the remote

so we really need to focus in and those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings and the channel settings because they're used

and that it's not a play and that

and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it so it doesn't give them

it's move on to the next presentation on the facts so

and screw

need to stop i considering what remote control actually is it's a

it's a device that allows us to do certain effects on the television so

device we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message to

i just these settings

i just these settings adjust brightness

adjust brightness

we need a clear idea of exactly what this product as a

in a way out suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different at the types of user interface is for this product

and then are trying to get some feedback about

how these particular prototypes what could so

we should remember that remote controls are a fairly standard this requirements when the users using

when the users using a remote control hear she expects the buttons to be in certain places so in some

a device to be is technological what can we do

the second is economic

so i had a look on the web to to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls in the analysing

what things they get light was bad about

light was bad about them what's wrong with them

them what's wrong with them

how we can improve on that designs that sounds and

sounds and what can we do to make a product stand out from the large majority of remote controls

he's two examples probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum

on the left to we've got it's an engineering based design for a remote control so it's

of buttons it's fully featured everything

and it might take a while to get to learn to use it but once you've

it but once you've learned that you can do whatever you want but your t. v.

it but again it's rings and on the bouts the

and on the bouts the disadvantages you can't

disadvantages you can't use it say to freeze the television but

as i said before remote controls all subjective different

personally what i want from a remote control is a device that simple it

also want something that looks

and that feels good that's

good that's ergonomically designed

for me to sit at a drastic difference between those two remotes

in either that we're very pretty you know

i think that could be our selling point

i think there's a certain a market for technology to looks but i think that's

doing so this anyone

so as we grew in

grew in a group and what are we gonna go cobble

if it's where the bottom under three icons and the one that

and the one that looks like a task that one

so this is are working design

i have a pet of some issues with this because

one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grind it works because

it converts electrical energy to granting the beans and then

and then you put the been through a filter not filters out

and then you get coffee at the end that's and hot because of the combination

don't know if i'm explain that very but how do

very but how do i get to the next

so the method as

what needs to be done and how do we convert

and how do we convert all the elements to make that and so

at which you need something to happen team make

so that's one thing are gonna work on

the user interface is critical here because

do you have for main components and

you have your energy source rate there which

the chip which is also controlled by the user so you have

i use that thing and that you can go back previous

pardon

doubleclick on it with the right with the left hand one

frozen he can show me to pick their we're

about this guy's i'm kind

this guy's i'm kind of pathetic with things like this

and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work or infrared

will work or infrared bulb which will then bring

which will then bring the data to the receiver so hopefully that makes

and personal preferences set of the fact that i kept we need a long lasting energy source people

straight-forward interface like he was saying simple not overwhelming it with information and we need

next

rusty thinking to be honest

let's see lucy ready to haiti

it's gonna stick in your head

that i was just you know for it before the meeting on that we have to keep in

we didn't bring it up that are out on the meetings that far but we're

it's approach thing

you don't have it in the states

do but you could explain it

you and you type in the page number you want to say like

control in this kind of index opinions on the television screen just and some text things and they looking graphics on it and you just

it's a nineteen eighties

i have no idea what we don't have that

or like your question earlier on whether this is going to be to for television d. v. or in it that are just a television that or focused on otherwise

to wanna get this out very quickly will they have

and finally it is more marketing i think our corporate image has to be recognisable so

image like it's kind of yellow colour we've we put fashion in electronics

looks like a kind of a yellow and black and we have that the

and we have that the emphasis on the r. s. a. and

it's we put the uh_huh fashion in electronics so we can keep that in

so we can keep that in mind

we need to

we need to talk about our functions and our target group we decide

we decide you worked hard repairs you in

you in your analysis of different market that the marketing you identified that different groups wanna different things or had a certain preferences

the younger people did it

and so are we adding this that

it's gonna be twenty

so it has to be a marketable to whoever it is

the only breaks i was given in terms of each was the voice activation and

after thirty five people don't really care that's why it's so it's like

that's probably a population of quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway so

anyway so that might be a fairly good target group for us

it because it's gonna have too much to the price

especially if we are marketing it as a separate product people are gonna be paying a

the producer

button them i dunno i'm gonna buy a new remote

that's a good thing to keep in mind

someone's looking to buy a new remote all they want like an upgrade now

upgraded or

we can look for would look at upgrade

or we can look at user-friendly

simplification he could have

he could have a crap remote taking

a crap remote taking with their t. v. that's

with their t. v. that's just impossible to use or maybe broke

or maybe broke or maybe

or maybe they're just messing it

or also have the other one's just separate somehow or

and you're happy person than ever not

person than ever not doesn't have to have like two remotes one that has

remotes one that has the easy one the one that has more complicated

that's a good idea

but that's gonna be was a technological thing

good point

so what are we emphasising but in this project

sit simplicity in fashion

those are very good calls i think that

i think that we have to keep in mind it with everything we do simplicity in fashion and or usability it's just

it's just how everyone say

that which includes an emphasis on making the infrared very functional so

so you don't have to travel around a lot

what can you do the like make the infrared more functional like why would it not be

the battery and that i think that the chip takes the data and presents a while without strips gathering

i don't know how useful the numbers if we're not doing

it's voice recognition which i kind of

and it might be too expensive

it's for like he ultimately lazy people you can't even
