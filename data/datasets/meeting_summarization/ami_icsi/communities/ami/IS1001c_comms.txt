button and if we could meet use of that
and not we just it take the buttons that don't need any government there
we have all the buttons so you can see a lot more still then we just need a once in a meeting

and i just want to mention the problem of the other we use and so which is much more expensive but then you push button and if we
you can use you find the button the dark or so
and as you get two of them "'cause" even though they have many buttons look quite simple and not
'cause we don't have these input buttons and those are the seventy and i think
no the button would be in fact it should
we on the top button
button whether we want some buttons
so the buttons of the beach and they're we'll have to know

we buttons you have a mixture
you have a mixture of buttons and will they wanted and down the buttons on the other side
and all that would be to the button and are a light c. d. so or you immediately then decide the right side because you have like ten buttons
i know but if you believe that's kinda and the wish and the buttons like they wanted and that around the buttons would go about this at it

we have our so button for volume and to switch on off the t. v.
i think that the volume and the buttons are available but not very easy to reach we thought it would be

and i think the remote control is a face mentioned previously
but is it is significant price on the war remote control "'cause" we can
as soon as you start to move of the remote control you have the right
so now the recent investigation we have done full of the remote control it's
so maybe for our remote control has to be an effort for more predictable forms something like
what kind of fruit would like to control your t. v. with

so most important aspect for remote controls used to be fancy look and feel and not to go round functional look and feel and
and the second aspect is is that the remote control should be a technological innovative
and the sold most important aspect is to me is that the cup remote control should be easy to use so
and you know the most important aspect is the fancy look and feel i've days the technology can innovative and after the easy to use
it seems to be you fancy innovative and easy to use

so we are here for the concept design meeting
i will take notes during these meetings so that you can look at my for there to c. d. summary of this meeting afterwards
the same for this team or this how would that would be the volume control big fan control and meeting power
there were closing the meeting
we can the walk around do that speced and the next meeting so of the finer
during need to have a meeting

that's a i think we have to keep that it's if it's possible
so if we don't have the buttons think it's possible

in fact i have the number of that it's an amount which is very strong all four remote control of the pushbutton are
of the pushbutton are usually extremely cheap but i just
we're we have already some good things with the backlight of the pushbutton
control and here you have the pushbutton too

and in our case we are using the the wheel control so
a somewhat can do it down could use it down of the wheel for the court if we want
so we just busy to use one just a wheel and
just a wheel and use it where you just the way to synch with that as in that case
i think we can keep the wheel
that but when the banana is curving right that's with the wheel on the top and to control and
but once the most critical for them to use it on for the wheel
before the wheel and then this for the buttons could have that
and the wheel on the top

so the concept u. s. b. c. station by industrial designer the sophistication
so maybe we can start we is the industrial design
just to it to make something which is a slightly more design and that's the the square a box with a rubber
so i just looked at some kind designs on the web off you more complicated not controls and as you get two of
it was a maybe a more economy design on the bottom
i think it's a good design and it's innovative as a way of them maybe

so last time we decided to have a simpler interface
you just have a very simple chip and the user interface is just than usually by pushbutton and in
for design off user interface or we
for interface we say though so that we have this band then a state was button and that's on the side
and have the user interface design and then evaluate the produce the product
to develop prototype i would say that's d. industrial designer and the user interface designer work together that would

and them at a yellow is expected to be spongy
either in different colours use spongy
banana his own soul yellow so you got close your remote controller then
so the colour is yellow or

this is a they'd notice use it to to a colour their eyes us to particular questions but
and i think that the plastic colours not very good idea because
i think that you put the colour to be even more difficult for user
the could one would say that we should fruity colours so then it's loading the television it turns it off
colour fancy
maybe a a colour that's remember some from a inside out

i just look at that just use when someone pages to find some documentation and i think
first of all i was thinking to have a look on to use like tents
so what software would be would look more or less the same of these two
the texas look
we have to make it look like a fruit or veg is a maybe a
and fall maybe look and feel of what's was a piece of a
so of the finer the look-and-feel design according to this easy and
you feel a free to express which you want to say you know if you to
