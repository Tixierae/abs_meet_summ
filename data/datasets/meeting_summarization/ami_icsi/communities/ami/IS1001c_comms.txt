and i think the remote control is a face mentioned previously
liz or what it is a these in was a quite big so would the
big so would the next page so
we have all the buttons so you can see a lot more still then we just need a once in a meeting
maybe there we will be would advantage euro competitors
fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes it shoes and furniture else
i think all kinds of them you just tell you can choose can see think it would work
the texas look
i know that they do that for clock or so
and fall maybe look and feel of what's was a piece of a
but that's not in the train the trendy spongy
a idea

we are more so the lighting in future for the remote control to be easy to find and four five
i only have three slides so i just
so i was looking for that chip which is a very stand up and i just go for that we use and so on the list on a pushbutton
and i think we if we could just talk about that if we're really needed we sense all you can if we can combine something with the pushbuttons
we sense or is fifty percent of the price of a pushbutton
and i just want to mention the problem of the other we use and so which is much more expensive but then you push button and if we
have a question a lot of
it was a maybe a more economy design on the bottom
i think that the volume and the buttons are available but not very easy to reach we thought it would be
thought it would be on the right side for example
you open it come break you can and what are things

you know it's expensive
i don't think that this is really expensive but the and
on to use like tents you know went you you press the on button you have the lights on your remote controller went you want to turn off you device
as a major idea i suppose pose
and also does it a few twenty and because it was a
a little boosting it about nine i
i think the spongy is a good because it's will be robust as
i think we can keep the wheel
because it's so easy it's innovative and you the cost is a retired and
and we're still have to find the so the fruit like p. on by nine with
with in your notes i do you

so we are here for the concept design meeting
we'd and to take a decision on concept and then
and the last point to use the trendwatching by a market expert
what is the purpose of the like
so just move the
and you know the most important aspect is the fancy look and feel i've days the technology can innovative and after the easy to use
you don't use of the bad and and that and eyes tearing like that but when the banana
maybe we can keep the banana and it would

and in our case we are using the the wheel control so
and they're can there we can i some common
i haven't read to my personal reference
i said about it appear for example you
a fruit like that i know
we can discuss

you just need to put their channel numbers somewhere bit out of the way
so if that's a pretty can be
i think that you put the colour to be even more difficult for user
so now the recent investigation we have done full of the remote control it's
and there's a fashion watchers in paris and you know that have detected the following trends
maybe a a colour that's remember some from a inside out

just a wheel and use it where you just the way to synch with that as in that case
because otherwise it's pretty stand out about the fact that's very simple or
so maybe discourse to to have more expense and that's that suspect
so maybe for our remote control has to be an effort for more predictable forms something like
the could one would say that we should fruity colours so then it's loading the television it turns it off
you can put "'em" on two sides and

so maybe we can start we is the industrial design
we're we have already some good things with the backlight of the pushbutton
you can see the buttons but of course
first of all i was thinking to have a look on to use like tents
so what software would be would look more or less the same of these two

so last time we decided to have a simpler interface
i do that was my name's
addition movie then you have your own
we from the u. n. e. d. inside

i just look at that just use when someone pages to find some documentation and i think
you just have a very simple chip and the user interface is just than usually by pushbutton and in
so it's only the central part
i think it's a good idea

if we have for example i think that the
so we just busy to use one just a wheel and
and the second aspect is is that the remote control should be a technological innovative

is there any questions for
and them at a yellow is expected to be spongy
i don't know which made a l. i can be spongy and if

so i think it's a bit aspects and it should get
for example you know as p. is like that it's and it's easy to have in harm's and
right and it's ergonomic

and then i we lady find the next task to have to be done before the next meeting
that but when the banana is curving right that's with the wheel on the top and to control and

so now we have three presentations so the
so this is the presentation

in fact i have the number of that it's an amount which is very strong all four remote control of the pushbutton are
it was a bunch of according so you can just record something simpler like a good one

'cause we can fold up to twelve euros for the price of the remote control
maybe we can just the centre this presentation and then the decision later on according to do is news

we'll call any made it from a one because we need is in the house it was only some cheap already there but
you move it you're fancier to press the button on to that you move the on the other side you can put "'em"

this is a they'd notice use it to to a colour their eyes us to particular questions but
you can use you find the button the dark or so

but as you move it that you brought up some sense of when you move it to the movie
as soon as you start to move of the remote control you have the right

but it can be battery "'cause" you mean no
to have the light or was

and with you wants but simple act as a major idea
for design off user interface or we

so we can move to the there is there
we have to make it look like a fruit or veg is a maybe a

and the sold most important aspect is to me is that the cup remote control should be easy to use so
so that seems we have speak about this before and

because it's robust
that at the e. d. is there anything you want to add

that's a i think we have to keep that it's if it's possible
and it's ergonomic as

i think it's it makes it was easy and goes in as a innovative so
innovative

either in different colours use spongy
i think we can have a like appear is a good seat whether or bad and i used to live

so we'll first doubt by a summarising the the previews be keenan the decision and we've taken

i will take notes during these meetings so that you can look at my for there to c. d. summary of this meeting afterwards

so each of you will show us to our use investigation that done during the previews hours

we so these idea to have a way to change china pretty that and china

china did you use buttons should be protected by a plastic or something called remote control to look very simple or

we have our so button for volume and to switch on off the t. v.

and four five development and we will crest we have decided to have an always c. d. in all voice features

so the concept u. s. b. c. station by industrial designer the sophistication

the sophistication of d. light by or u. i. i

maybe i can switch slide your request

we can challenge do it in fact

of the pushbutton are usually extremely cheap but i just

but i just have one problem and this is related with that we've sensible which seems to be quite expensive

but is it is significant price on the war remote control "'cause" we can

so we these we is including or with you but things scroll buttons wheel and it should be a lower than twelve euros to produce

should talk about some of the design of the box and so which need some money but

say do you to see the email about the voice settlement

that's a tough no

you receive something

you know that one ask "'em" are you gonna call and you come on and so

button and if we could meet use of that

just to it to make something which is a slightly more design and that's the the square a box with a rubber

but then in the dark

but you going to go stand on the like

it would be done on when the user move the new remote control raising no

but you need another facet for about

but the and this is plenty of an extent very cheap device ease but it's the biggest false to be

but like to go to the wouldn't be too but you can read those are expensive so

do the presentation

so my a one need should be there shared folder

last time so

just move the next slide

so i just looked at some kind designs on the web off you more complicated not controls and as you get two of

and as you get two of them "'cause" even though they have many buttons look quite simple and not

and not we just it take the buttons that don't need any government there

it was a do your wrist problem with the users

liz or what

so from the bottom or whatever they're they're all of the numbers and then the top i do that and it's just me but nevertheless

but nevertheless one is exactly the same for this team or

the same for this team or this how would that would be the volume control big fan control and meeting power

so it's only the central

'cause we don't have these input buttons and those are the seventy and i think

and i think that the plastic colours not very good idea because

and to put it out there the big buttons but there it's not be difficult to present and buttons either

you do what the hell not the circuit board put the plastic cover on things that you know one of the mess with black buttons for the tuning the tennis and like that

use a somewhat

a somewhat can do it down could use it down of the wheel for the court if we want

i the market if it's a tough but

or we can move to the next parts maybe and discuss afterwards

so most important aspect for remote controls used to be fancy look and feel and not to go round functional look and feel and

this is a good though so far

but will i think all kinds

it would work right

i think it is but those to have a spongy bread

you can throw it said that they live here

you get the way we can do and before we try yes

we try yes and you know

i think it's innovative to use the the wheely because i think no one and s. i. d.

how would you can use the question

colour fancy

the bottom a lot of

we can discuss that at the

the trendy spongy and digit they were fruits

what kind of fruit would like to control your t. v. with

and then i think it's a idea

banana his own soul yellow so you got close your remote controller then

control and here you have the pushbutton too

yes we gotta sell the just for the scare me and

on two sides and week we know

i think it's a good design and it's innovative as a way of them maybe

and it would be very easy to find

and everybody knows what he's a banana
