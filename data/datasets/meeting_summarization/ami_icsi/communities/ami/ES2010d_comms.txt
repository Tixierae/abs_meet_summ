great i think it in the house and job it
i think it's beautiful
it is beautiful and everything that we discussed
the java it's a really good
what's next in our agenda
no it's under evaluation
so these are the criterion ask is it
true or false easy to use
yes right we're able to deal
that was and we discussed
even know what it is for just a t. v. remote it's very rare just put it is just a t.
i'd go for a three or four now and so
let's go for it to be point
think she is i think work or decide about is do we need to put to use here
like because there's like one interface for your and then because it's not to be on the same plane when you press the button there's

sense of material sign exactly what we're going for i'm just gonna translate what this all means we have the
then there's the latex cover which is what you see as read
and the buttons will be all much slider blow on a see-through sort of a very pale
sort of a very pale blue on a light up yellow and whole thing like to be
of time taken we do have here you go right ahead
no it's fine here in
fine here in your project manager
i mean and it is i have voice i
is i have voice i mean the phrase recognition on it
we could do with the chip yes it
was and we had no we're function of it on the prototype but
and we discussed that be included
and what else what it needs to be technologically innovative

then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote then we're going to
on top just treat it
in did you determine the the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand is gonna be single or double
right although that it's going
squishy and fruity it's
it's a very clear on things question for it
so are models little resemble you try it was just croaking appears be winner and a half of
it's plastic

so are channel and volume will be on either side
within this range so for easy to use
don't use my opinion
alright let's go back to the yes
so now more movement fine it's
the button there's no have to be additional signals on the side so was
don't know on a mike but as

here's the agenda for our last meeting
we have forty minutes so
physically
right in the last criteria is it is that
nine what was it in
when the costs and

we discussed the evaluation criteria and that's
we're gonna have integrated scroll wheel isn't of those
no we don't have the scroll buttons
isn't of those just regular buttons
that's a pushbutton see right there

yes can be thicker
i think it feels good
we don't have that you know we can say channel like change the channel l. a.
and it doesn't cover everything of the t. v. so
of the t. v. so i'd probably give it a three

meeting at the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation and then we're going to
which is quite buttons are two probably you least used menu you'd and then
it's only actually the size of my head
to end it i say we individually way or

concave sort of thing for i can
and a half of what was the one that's a good idea
there are there special form concerned can do it
and they're special material

so presentation i
but it's so we do have a mobile covers right
so reason that criteria a first point scale
if so we can proceed if

like that's false
but that just covers the type of button we're having because we're not doing
i like that twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and
pushbutton but we just

dear
and a it's a product hey right
and it's it is very ergonomically designed it's gonna
designed it's gonna be curved

and i think the scrolling
it is buttons
prototype but that's because it's only two dimensions silly

and as you notice on our prototype they've ended up with a curvature kind of by concave
it's not a hand dynamo it's power by battery so we give it
number of components you plan to use their just put

and then the last thing is that we black labelling on top just
feel good meaning what physically
like does it feel that like physically

right we're able to deal with that kind of chip
proceed if that we need to go back to do and where little bit case
you wanna go for this is where we need to make final concert a lithium or you want or triple a.s "'cause" triple a.s were gonna

i found out or just
to start it's in a stick it in a

then we're going to evaluate the product and i think the whole production process and
process and then when the close up we have forty minutes so

read because it can be replaceable we just come up with the colour and then the
and then the buttons actually kind of poking through rather than on top and the buttons

they're one button but they kind of push up and down
to filter easy to use

so i am hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that because
and it's so we need to discuss how we feel it falls within this range so

ask is it easy to use fashionable i like i we should reduce
i we should reduce down so we can reference time

'cause that would help us
here's a little difficult to incorporate be cover with each any fruit ahead

are we going to end it i say we
fine

easy to use i would though six
to to i said

at the moment no
the side so was i gonna be an extra one on each side

two or three two point
two point i

no they're all the customers
does it feel good

we've covered that with be trendy
it's just trendy

case of all very capable
and we're going to fill in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty euro if so we can

a good idea
but it's like you're selling it to hit the which is good that's good

i think the people who purchases are gonna be technologically right
we want to leave it

to interface this is our it's
t. or would it be three

it started out know

what time project presentation

ready

ready

e. you read that since you wrote it

the basic is gonna be cannot operate which is what we decided it's could be plastic

it's could be plastic then

whole thing like to be should have any button rather than a just that one button a light up

and then the bottom we have our logo bright yellow

bright yellow sort of design with the r. which will actually look like or logo and then on the side

and then on the side you have the buttons they're one button but

the buttons

on off switch will be here and as

and then these are the numbers so

it's a single

single

sounds good "'cause" it's not big enough to really constitute a double

right what's next

and that's with courtney

that's just the current trends "'cause"

hello were great

fashionable

i mean it's a very chic

no i mean like an l. i think it's very fashionable

mean it's a very chic

i'll give it a two because at the moment it's not look and then

that's just like that's the claim it's a prototype we think

i'd give it like three or four

so the average is about a two

then not fashionable so

the shape of it actually do it's

alright average is two

is it technologically innovative of time taken

you go right ahead

no that's only part was an hour right

it's capable of being squishy and fruity

and it's very important there we go

next

i'm gonna show you excel spreadsheet and

bit case only thing that

their just put quantity being one battery or

a.s "'cause" triple a.s were gonna do you want one battery holders just go for a lithium

holders just go for a lithium we say

down the electronics section we're gonna need this kind

we're gonna need this kind corrective to the voice sensor so one of those

it is the single curve so one of those

that's correct p. down here case

p. down here case material plastic

we have plastic

and special colour

and special colour

down here interface type we're gonna have

integrated scroll-wheel or pushbutton we

pushbutton we really haven't just push button interface

to what we want to have them and one for this one each for each side

because we're not doing a scroll on the side it's a push button

but we just have push

we have these calls

because when you sign one on top i mean it's

on top i mean it's fine it's it comes up the same as twenty nine what was it

and we're gonna button supplements

button supplements the buttons are not

they're special colour
