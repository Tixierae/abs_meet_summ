and then on the side you have the buttons they're one button but
no we don't have the scroll buttons
because we're not doing a scroll on the side it's a push button
the button there's no have to be additional signals on the side so was

and we're gonna button supplements
button supplements the buttons are not

and then the buttons actually kind of poking through rather than on top and the buttons
they're one button but they kind of push up and down
pushbutton we really haven't just push button interface

is it technologically innovative of time taken
and what else what it needs to be technologically innovative

and the buttons will be all much slider blow on a see-through sort of a very pale
whole thing like to be should have any button rather than a just that one button a light up
which is quite buttons are two probably you least used menu you'd and then
isn't of those just regular buttons
but that just covers the type of button we're having because we're not doing
like because there's like one interface for your and then because it's not to be on the same plane when you press the button there's

i think the people who purchases are gonna be technologically right
and the means meeting technology that we used to produce our little cat there and if we find a
right and we got say over what i have technologically advanced should be and also have fashionable
if we have one on but useful things i don't think i mean that's our technology

and teamwork and the means
the means the whiteboard didn't work

then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote then we're going to
it is beautiful and everything that we discussed
we discussed the evaluation criteria and that's
and we discussed that be included

proceed if that we need to go back to do and where little bit case
you wanna go for this is where we need to make final concert a lithium or you want or triple a.s "'cause" triple a.s were gonna
down the electronics section we're gonna need this kind
we're gonna need this kind corrective to the voice sensor so one of those
think she is i think work or decide about is do we need to put to use here

i'd give it like three or four
two or three two point
i'd go for a three or four now and so

and more fashion forward
and that's you right brain taken over what one in the artistic the fashionable the hip you know if we have one on
in elementary school that's old fashioned to me
i mean how many people wanna buy a nokia phone that back when we're like in high school just like get the changeable faceplates
fashionable she people
fashion people buy it

then we're going to evaluate the product and i think the whole production process and
so reason that criteria a first point scale
and it's so we need to discuss how we feel it falls within this range so
right in the last criteria is it is that
up now the costs are within the budget we evaluate the
we evaluate the project and now we're going

feel good meaning what physically
like does it feel that like physically
enter for here when you do you feel strongly that the internet

meeting at the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation and then we're going to
that's just like that's the claim it's a prototype we think
was and we had no we're function of it on the prototype but
prototype but that's because it's only two dimensions silly
how do you guys enjoy make the model the prototype

process and then when the close up we have forty minutes so
what time project presentation
fine here in your project manager
now we're gonna talk about the project process and one
and one hour satisfied with the u. whole process and the result until we have
and how did you feel about the whole process though
to the project leader
