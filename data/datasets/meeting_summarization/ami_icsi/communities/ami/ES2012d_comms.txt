i can add kind of a natural kind of idea words like
that kind of look like a flower power plant for the more natural kind
for the more natural kind of

we have the same kind of buy and here's just
it you can see they could just kind of goes the right that's the
and so we figured it would be kind of in a lightweight plastic just kind of a light
just kind of a light in nondescript grey so that
any other kind of you just never rubbery and that way you
we might never have to like that so it kind
words like more of a kind of like a babysitting like there i can like

and there's holes for the buttons to come through
those stay on and then the buttons come through and
i'll start with laughs it's the same size increase that in my mind that button and but
we got push buttons and then the simple slide so
less buttons are most but
all because a minute older people in common is the buttons anyway we're actually probably like that but not the voice that's
on having you know a million buttons

and then the covers all be that sort of rubbery material like p. make ipod covers so they can add the
so they can add the structure over
you just kind of structured over

no this is a company is costing for various aspects of design and
for instance if they require was to have it in the corporate colours than that it a special colour that's
a special colour that's that's a standard colour
just because i also get the colour of the whole thing that's the some cost
but i don't know the special colour anyway be the cost
anyway be the cost is that come in at exactly on target twelve point five but

like this i think it's kind of moulded to the shape of your hand the
we just link then i it comes down to base
it comes down to base the hand and flat
the hand and flat out
to like that so it kind in your hands channels and have it there
i think we can argue that we have coming on top just

and looks like we've for them a good job here and
good job here and we'll discuss with be the final are the final v. channels
the the next then we'll we'll have a look at the the topic of the prototypes and
and it is so a comedy routine they're they're looking difference
watch uses to look at the fine and this
door think we've than an amazing job and
so i mean i think we worked together and looked
and looked really it was the consumers want it might work trying to make can

good this is what we need make these things simple so the
need a calculator for that

grey so that people wanna buy the covers and then the covers all
know spongy like it's something that people wanted and
when i just one that i mean how people put least then we found that right
it is "'cause" people the option if they've got
today so far and functional
a built in the speech where are you function
we have to do the dishes are saying that old people be less likely to be extra money but function
but function the increase functionality easy to use a device make the company

and that could be evaluation criterion finance and then
a hundred what do you want standards and near the evaluation where
that the product or the project
this evaluation of the product was to just see the middle one criteria all the conditions that we said that since it's the self from the point you that the consumer in the lounge and so
and that roughly concludes my evaluation of the product
not costs within budget yes is
budget yes is the project evaluated we're

'cause if it if it's a good at it as a fashion item i mean
the double curve spot on the other hand because a lot a full fashion concept we should exceed the sales targets
that any slide to compromise we have to make on cost is offset by the maybe the concept of it being a fashion accessory and then having the exchangeable covers so
is the device flashy and fashionable
groups just "'cause" we have gone with the fashion focusing
with the fashion focusing younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it but

the final product would actually stand that
that this slide here i mean they've satisfaction with their room for creativity i mean i think
i mean i think we've allowed ourselves as much creativity is the the product i'll i was i

r. s. i. e. there's the car standards

would be there for older your role concept is
sell something the the basic concept is actually going on and it is

and adjust these other another idea somewhere is is this all it is
where it we will have to find a city make it a standard chip to do this with and the idea
and the idea i'm tom so that they all and so
i think the results speak for itself and new ideas found
and new ideas found that again give a given noticeably every day product but then we've got a very very effectively come up with a menu
