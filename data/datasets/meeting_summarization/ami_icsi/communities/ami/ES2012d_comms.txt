and then just whatever production and
and and then we include use
on that's the little menu team this is the infrared
sending raise here you know pointing like that can send it or if you hold it
or if you hold it up like that it'll send that
in her is has the cover on it you can see they
grey so that people wanna buy the covers and then the covers all
those stay on and then the buttons come through and
that each one of a monetary and a half the logo with the yellow circle one r. r.
a little bit the covers as
i mean they say city celp when i just one that i mean
when i just one that i mean how people put least then we found that right
i'll start with laughs it's the same size increase that in my mind that button and but

here's just you hold it
you hold it like this i
an actress you can hold it in scroll
can hold it in scroll you can hold it in and watch this is d. power
this is d. power key it's going

we're gonna have to design brief
and the idea i'm tom so that they all and so
the that i don't think is a serious problem the
but we made a basic decision no that's fundamental to the design so that
but still one seven one being true and seven being false

simple so the the boss can understand network
five no this is
you can easily and some i mean
a built in the speech where are you function
very long to learn to use shouldn't

good job here and we'll discuss with be the final are the final v. channels
maybe it's dan we
for instance if they require was to have it in the corporate colours than that it a special colour that's
i think it made me mad all of the consumer

you can it'll be sending raise here
and then the covers all be that sort of rubbery material like p. make ipod covers so they can add the
but i don't know the special colour anyway be the cost
my presentation

that's just kind of
the hand and flat out
sell something the the basic concept is actually going on and it is
watch uses to look at the fine and this

welcome so it should be the last of these meetings and
obtain probably
bit actual effort to

and it to sort of structures over and the
could broaden the promenade it so it would stands
it so it would stands like that

some to do for you this is very much each bill stretching over yourself and it'll be fine
you just kind of structured over
and it'll be fine

it comes down to base the hand and flat
anyway be the cost is that come in at exactly on target twelve point five but
that any slide to compromise we have to make on cost is offset by the maybe the concept of it being a fashion accessory and then having the exchangeable covers so

to like that so it kind in your hands channels and have it there
the final product would actually stand that
there to put it is minor d. sell something the

and looks like we've for them a good job here and
m. k. each our team response to these questions so

so if i if you'd like to a presidential proposals
and it is so a comedy routine they're they're looking difference

and there's holes for the buttons to come through
and so we figured it would be kind of in a lightweight plastic just kind of a light

other a lot on top of those are like no sir
like a mobile covers and you have to screw them on you can smell to get

but it's also easier plumbers like a mobile covers and you
more and clicks in the microphone

this is a just databases a bit bigger and
no this is a company is costing for various aspects of design and

and adjust these other another idea somewhere is is this all it is
but then again stick average

but but never but they that but
for the more natural kind of

we got push buttons and then the simple slide so
they did be the product

covers so maybe
make a name so

some of these questions is
is the device flashy and fashionable

are also but technologically innovative
today so far and functional

that is the last meeting and look at it as red

the the next then we'll we'll have a look at the the topic of the prototypes and

and that could be evaluation criterion finance and then

we have the same kind of buy and here's just

like this i think it's kind of moulded to the shape of your hand the

the last we've got these scroll for the volume on the right we

on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down an actress you

it's going to be you know turn

this is the infrared section so

that that a microphone there which for all the voice commands you can you talk to like

you can you talk to like that it'll still

that it'll still in a sense

the logo was down down there in her

it you can see they could just kind of goes the right that's the

cover a car goes over everything and there's holes

just kind of a light in nondescript grey so that

shame each other a lot on

so they can add the structure over

no sir

any other kind of you just never rubbery and that way you

know spongy like it's something that people wanted and

over and the way i think probably hope to protect a little bit too as

you can smell to get some to do for you this

and all those stay on and then

'cause if it if it's a good at it as a fashion item i mean

i mean it's standing

i mean is it's a i. d. system is just a minor d. so points

it is "'cause" people the option if they've got

if that's because we might actually have several lined up on the

we just link then i it comes down to base

would be there for older your role concept is

we might never have to like that so it kind

i can add kind of a natural kind of idea words like

words like more of a kind of like a babysitting like there i can like

that kind of look like a flower power plant for the more natural kind

what's on the next one i

try and get any a spreadsheet top

and maximise

good this is what we need make these things simple so the

and that teaches some of these slightly literally given the constraints placed on those

on those of an effort for instance if they

a special colour that's that's a standard colour

so would just simply on batteries they do the want they

they do the want they want decision that had to make it is that's

where it we will have to find a city make it a standard chip to do this with and the idea

the the voice sensor is is expensive but we

so that has to stay

and again the shape of the case means it's expensive to it to make "'cause" we did the double curve spot

the double curve spot on the other hand because a lot a full fashion concept we should exceed the sales targets

it's internet or plastic so

plastic so that's the problem and

just because i also get the colour of the whole thing that's the some cost

when i should a scroll wheel we got push

and then the buttons alright

but i so i think we have a very strong case to argue that's what would cost is so you need innovative and and difference that

if the marriage can expect us to be taken who personally i can also or fairly get technologically innovative that they have to accept that we can operate within the constraints are they give us a

are they give us a new we present

we present this is the the company's way forward and

i think we can argue that we have coming on top just

does anybody want to a hundred what

a hundred what do you want standards and near the evaluation where

the evaluation where where where

that the product or the project

this evaluation of the product was to just see the middle one criteria all the conditions that we said that since it's the self from the point you that the consumer in the lounge and so

what i can sit it is on the whiteboard

seventeen hours when i'm number two two

wanted true and seven to fly is

the post technology into it

can't seem to make it any easier

suitable for the consumer has

to look

it's a complicated

and functional

r. s. i. e. there's the car standards

less buttons are most but

you lose so it was a bit actual effort

that's it is so the handle more gonna be correct as

what was it at all age groups
