then we will take to do this easy and and the remote control functions
so we have to have a remote control very out for that it's of the buttons
so we made rest make a very easy to use a remote control was mainly those buttons and maybe

what we wanna share is the remote control right
but what kind of remote controls that
and remote controls are bad for
we knows that's a that "'cause" i use that remote control to challenge is an l.
and so as we say before i think in a remote control like meaning do that keeps it's a good thing to not
we don't have the original a remote control for everything
we would it seems that we know want to have a t. v. remote control from the
so all before or of the meeting we can define what would be the characteristic of the of the controller of the remote controller and
you know some remote control of a protection and so

what if we didn't to be does the t. v. remote control it's going to be very simple
what if it's going to be a simple as possible and that's the remote control or not affectionate i can't see

to control so most people want to have a remote for the hi-fi and t. v. and like that and but
and but other people want starts remotes for at controlling the and ball is like but that's in your box and two plus
of the tasted people say that it's quite difficult to to use of the remote control
that's or so we see that's most people are find it's find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mean you use only teach and then this and volume buttons so
because most people are find also ought to find the remote control of
so it should be lighting in the dark i think because most people are lost their remote control

a lot of the time is a it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control so they
and or so we'd it would take more time to develop to have a region are you near each remote control
star burst a remote control takes maybe a one amounts to do that

so few buttons so and then volume going for
volume maybe a mute button and then on off button

and two plus all wants of remotes for controlling and the courthouse

that's in fact we it seems that's we are going to make a t. v. remote control according to new requirements are we seen from the management wall
so i'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control in fact
in fact fall for remote control this is quite easy we just

so the buttons for eileen access of meeting and as the buttons for on the market is
if not many buttons and right you use a bill buttons
stand on button one
when one's father some other one was button even
you say that i want i have six buttons
if you have the l. c. d. screen if you don't you completely the way you want because the buttons was would look the way you want and what it
that teletext is just one button
you see one button used to one more button if
and and of course but i'm attending buttons

and whereas this question if they prefer any c. d. screen or on the remit each function remotes control and

there's a project i think cortex how or something like that's that's you can integrate the remote with their computers and so
use used to kill about voice control
and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want you say that i want
and then or so we have to make a very korea that's used this remote control is this popped off or projects and throw lock operate low will and colours and and design as where so that's they don't straight as one of our product

so you can see that it's seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly so you
a t. percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy a.
a. t. and red percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look up
seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot it's so
and after that we just do it according to spend some time to the not to the television so far

in how usability that we had so it's the remote control use a monk one hundred subjects and

then in the access then random access
then random access
so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and like that
we can do send the remote control to have access you know some

if we want to make it very soon but we have to redo them a button compared to the to work on to do that
i mean they are down buttons for their know how to work
