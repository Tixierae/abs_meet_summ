that was the main criteria from the last meeting you had to teach you proof
each criteria i've got the criteria is and
so the first criteria you'll
first criteria look and feel so it does
so i'll just write criteria we'll get what second criteria
criteria sex r. s. i. is a good i

the main we'd have to make i'm right handed one and i left and this one
but if we make a right handed or left and it then

with these are we done for that can i say some power
i it's all system done
done very sad
been done before where we're not just rehashing old design

one being true so it's more like it's fits the criteria and seven
and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria and the criteria
we fit it all the criteria i

we're gonna call product like
and for electronics we decided on it being just a simple the easiest saying this inside and
number one product
we decide that we just had the squeeze our product a little bit
all project was to come up with the product what the for

those are that's the design that's a that's a design thing
there are designer there are some heated discussion but we
funny all design the meetings could be this quick
poker we design and no more believers but

this is fine a small and then they say it's something that's kind of new looks a bit kirk if people want that it's

one thing i think that we need to look at is the costs
the costs as i said
that's gonna cost that that's gonna cost
that's gonna cost ten euros seventy cents seen it to make an thought
'kay criteria for is costs as
that i mean this is we saved on the production cost do we know how much we were making a profit

i think it would be compatible with the left and right hand side
imagine that are you right-handed
imagine it did it with your left hand i don't think
this side this so i can imagine

and it's also can for mobile to the size of your hand i
to the size of your hand i mean if it's too big it's a rubber remote so you can you know

so if you hold it like that the one on your thumb the thumb button is the power button
that's the log button has a
i mean it's only pressing buttons you don't have to do
buttons you don't have to do anything you know extraordinary i think it would be
and is button supplements then
man a buttons
contains only the necessary buttons
like the amount buttons "'cause" people like a lot let black so it's a one

is everybody ready
so all that i mean important cues are ready you if you're right it convenient place for you to access them so you don't you
and i think i might just wanna put in as project manager the you know the price for everybody here i haven't worked on it you know both individually
done everybody

but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different
it gets come up with you know the thing that's what we were looking at doing right now is the know seems to be there
right and that looks on the board right
and feel so it does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about as it is it
it gets kinda that was an old apartment all

it was in the new high tech
not every everything else is fairly simple but the fact that we use the kinetic energy was new
it's does everything that we wanted it to do it's new
new which is one of the quite serial else just come up with something or something you
put up a pain with a camera on it i don't think it's such a new thing i mean it's
thing i mean it's you know in such a new idea it would be different

to make the double "'cause" conceded and if this
very simple and easy to use double
double curved
curved but also something that was gonna do about people something
the case we've gone for the double curved
i mean these ones on the side or curved kind of
