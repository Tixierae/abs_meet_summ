do with it but it's easy enough to go through with these are
with these are we done for that can i say some power
the case we've gone for the double curved
i have made out of rubber
colours on line so
i mean these ones on the side or curved kind of
this side this so i can imagine
the evaluation
this is this like to keep informed so

imagine it did it with your left hand i don't think
have them in stock
make a more appealing
just something i think it's great great idea
do you think it says r. r.

no i know people who have left handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer for the first family and to have a mouse and everybody's using right-handed knows
and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria and the criteria
so seven is here one c. and then you've got in the middle so the first
it's not the kind of thing that's gonna slip like between couch cushion or something you know

seems to be there done
but if we make a right handed or left and it then
as square
to us a definite one

i have a definite you know the phone and
i see that makes sense because i remember like you better off my mom over there i remember people's mom's making like a play doh where you just like make the you use colouring and then make some sort of go
i mean it's only pressing buttons you don't have to do

i see that makes sense because
you're right click i was thinking it's left and design right-handers in the family want to have two remotes
an thought it was it had come in under twelve fifty so

we're gonna call product like
but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different
which is and anti r. s. r.

and then you can also there's a numeric keypad on top so you can keep directly to the channel if you want so
so it's really basic functionality is as far as what keys are available but we think it's very
spend this

right that's gonna cost
that's not a technological same as another thing it as another marketing things on the
"'kay" criteria

we're under budget
that's gonna cost ten euros seventy cents seen it to make an thought
it's like that also and like a number one

'kay criteria for is costs as
cost to come in
to come in under budget to us a definite

play-doh
because kids

curved but also something that was gonna do about people something
do about people something to be different separated

ring fingers volume up you think he's volume down
was a big good thing

banana "'em" as a mute button and
this is all very good the bosses will

and it's also can for mobile to the size of your hand i
to the size of your hand i mean if it's too big it's a rubber remote so you can you know

buttons you don't have to do anything you know extraordinary i think it would be
plus red which is sort of a fruit and vegetable

fashion into electronics
it's got them the black yellow and blue

i need that kind of a
three

one thing i think that we need to look at is the costs
i'd say is not if you're left-handed

play the whole last very long have will go out of
the interface is pushbuttons

a could do you know i can do this up on mine are could do with it but it's
whole

and is button supplements then
so what mark so we give for that

so for special colours
one being true so it's more like it's fits the criteria and seven

special form
right and that looks on the board right

function
i still have this map later

and the criteria is that are and
because it is more k. to lie and the table left-handed people but

have we implemented new technology it was in
it was in the new high tech

hold on folks we fit
done very sad

play-doh as edible you know that

i used to you to

you know the phone and now is edible

is to prove

but it's made edible "'cause"

to make the double "'cause" conceded and if this

and if this was an edible them

no more babies

why is everybody

is everybody ready

let's have your own let's get guys have they are presentation

it's pretty exciting so

we wanna do we want it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber very simple and easy

very simple and easy to use double

double curved

separated from the other remotes got on the market so

so i think if you put this in the palm of your hand you know see what a thing we have gone

so if you hold it like that the one on your thumb the thumb button is the power button

index finger is channel up know fingers channel down ring fingers

that's the log button has a

has a on a banana "'em" as a mute button

and also has digit

was as to what button and

and i'll meet

for muting

so all that i mean important cues are ready you if you're right it convenient place for you to access them so you don't you

change that so that

so that is that what my what you guys were hoping one and for are expecting or that's it

thing about it but it's a small think the main we'd have to make

the main we'd have to make i'm right handed one and i left and this one

but that's that as to why that's not possible

if we build rocket ships we can handle that can do that right that remotes

and i left and

and i left and it's is it is

but then you can learn to use you're right click

i'm they'll be able to

i think it would be compatible with the left and right hand side

imagine that are you right-handed

but we can have ball for

i think it's i see are more so it is we bring fashion that's it to electronics outside i could be quite fashionable

it gets come up with you know the thing that's what we were looking at doing right now is the know seems to be there

and role playing around is

before we move on

the costs as i said

but that was very cheap

will go out of the physical

that was the main criteria from the last meeting you had to teach you proof

and for electronics we decided on it being just a simple the easiest saying this inside and

then they have special colours on line

special form

special form they're special form they're in shapes and

special material

and there any special material no not

no not made of wood

not made of wood or titanium rubber i mean it just simple

the rubber on a

so let's say if that comes within budget right

that's gonna cost that that's gonna cost

right actually making a better profit and we expect a

the bosses will be very please this

so we saved think

so that's me done with this but this is to see in

to see in there common to what you were gonna do

i could talk to our kids

so evaluation gonna do it all together

gonna do it all together so evaluating

so evaluating each criteria

each criteria i've got the criteria is and

and we have to do it on a scale of one to seven one being true

and how close this up on the board so

so we have a box

so the first criteria you'll

you'll get would i hope

i hope first

first criteria look and feel so it does

and feel so it does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about as it is it

it is it colourwise and is it spongy so what mark

i would give it a seven

a one so i'll just write

so i'll just write criteria we'll get what second criteria

second criteria new technology have

the kinetic thing

that was i mean technological innovation not every

not every everything else is fairly simple but the fact that we use the kinetic energy was new

those are that's the design that's a that's a design thing

things on the technical side of it a

it's about in the middle somewhere maybe i

two three

middle somewhere maybe i dunno

across here three is it easy to use i think it's the one

easy to use i'd say

not if you're left-handed it's not

if we're gonna have one left in a one i had i dunno give it a one but otherwise it in

man a buttons

contains only the necessary buttons

like the amount buttons "'cause" people like a lot let black so it's a one

criteria sex r. s. i. is a good i

it's anti r. s. i.

this one and criteria

and criteria seven was the last and that they get lost

that they get lost is easy to get lost

is easy to get lost

i'm having is gonna get lost easily

it is very bright

but it is smallish

i think they would could be to get lost

you think you lost

and it's not fully

and it's not fully is not fully like you can't say i mean this

i mean it's still flush it out so that theoretically but

anything i mean it's better than average more i

the mobiles get lost all the time

then you bring "'em" and you find a bit so

so that's that first

first evaluation so i'd

evaluation so i'd say he

i it's all system done

with tom

number one product

if we call file

we fit it all the criteria i

and i think i might just wanna put in as project manager the you know the price for everybody here i haven't worked on it you know both individually

you know both individually and as a team and
