and just to reiterate after this meeting a team or reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control
so because we're is confusions they
great presentation
there are fashion in orange away
mine will always read copy of something or i copied
if you wanna start the next slide
to save money for the components the remote should be mass produced in basic material should be but on that as
just talking to the manufacturing division they suggested
a certain restrictions to apply here though x.
though x. t. k. do solar power with a latex one so
and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip which we could utilise
in addition to that in for our for and all those different options to the customer for producing their remote we're going to have multiples of each type like
i'm not exactly how it's gonna work is to you program the reprogram their sponsors and the question is
menu options of the way the remote read to
better it'll sell
i thought you are offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different you know i think we'd
'cause this is something really small then it sort of harder to imagine a base for it that was quite
it's not gonna be huge universal remote
so we can make it small of we have like all locating device
right i agree it
i'm kind of leaning in that direction of this kind of
if this was a successful remote we might then produce a higher and version of it i think
that then i mean squishy or the
for voice activation would it be like a certain turn we say like
i see i'm not i'm just really trying to because
or we could do one small with him "'cause" you know the
but if you have to replace it every five years
as long as we saw with that
dial and that the central button could have maybe a logo on it

we're back for the conceptual design meeting
let's get started
i'm gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as price manager when have three presentations
and then we're going to come to a decision on the remote control concepts and
that we have forty minutes ago
awesome
that we need of real reaction mother colour scheme that's one
ready for the next slide
channels that only this show watch to say that are watching
say that are watching on c. b. v.s or something like that i like
wouldn't need that is more for like a d. v. d. function which are not gonna be you think
so again it's sort of like just give you ideas and down at the bottom
examples but also some more just possible is a week go with the moment
right ready
as if we find another company you can produce the required chips casing l. e. d. any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate then we are cells are producing we should go for
the base the charging base that rechargeable batteries
i think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now i'm not
so we wanna go for plastic or what
you're kinda department mate
brilliant then
so what's gonna look like
it might be the four way scroll to i mean it if
whatever as long as or something big in the middle which is
big in the middle which is like the old phones there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something and
know if we have scroll thing on the side we definitely have time labelled

they want everything but simply
so in milan and paris recently the terms of in showing that clothing shoes and furniture are just covered with fruit and vegetable patch or so
go with that because it is just to try and our product
and i was thinking about different times a designs and i came up with something actually very here
look into it but anyway next
let's go back to you now
now i have to make some decisions
say before and that's just that this new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition
because we could produce you know how cellphones have those overlay is that you can change the colour we could
we could do a one that fits in with the trends of the year so here's this
here's this here's a fruit that n. s. y.
so knows
we could do for a cherry cover for this year and then
they can buy it cases maybe
i mean squishy or the mike so hard plastic
i don't think we should do voice i
because it's you know which is so high tech
my little sister got for christmas two that one is key finders that's a hearing me have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work and then should
the more expensive than two
i kind
i kind of like your idea about the right true phone dial and
of you have the circle and the button and the middle end of the gonna get a wider than your if your hands are because

they want us to tell them yes
so and also the spongy feel is in contrast to last year i don't know really
so we design preferences
preferences we need easy to read like ward should buttons clearly labelled so that
so that i mean "'cause" we talked about that being a problem and
but and that could also tie in with the colour scheme
that sort of looking into how we want to do it by feel
for it that was quite a substantial a size sort of standing up
be original
i'm not that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole way of
remotes if
that would be like i made class so we
make that is if it got to pick the all of you have

i can and some of that issue anything with my presentation
so what we click two is something like a fashion telephone like this
where we put the buttons around like we put a big on off button or something else no i mean it
then also this the idea of the base that sort of like an idea
ready
so that we could reduce cost
because that's awfully text definitely a squishy that then
so they're more widely available now and they also have
either an initial need to one battery menu by "'cause" i'm pretty
right that's what i meant
we could think about it come back to our next meeting someone really
so it cover that first category user interface
user interface concept meaning

i mean i spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to do rather than like
what it really is a v. on what you think it is this down because of that down arrow it's
it's like sort of "'cause" the utah it turned out the other way up
what kind of chip would we need for this guy
how complicated are we gonna go with the voice activated
and then should laugh and it's are going off in a person you can turn it off so
so it became highly irritating
if they just about the sample sensor sample speaker it's a brain you chip one introduce in
i think triple a. it'll be later
it depends on what the energy is needed

next slide please just talking
that splinters it
sort of arnold not exactly why they're explaining in the way they are the sample
i agree it either gonna be bigger with the base are smaller with just
smaller with that
a battery like this guy alright so what direction
alright so what direction you wanna go and you wanna
i think if we had a locating device that a small one i think that seems way more advanced
i've had three watches go that way too
watches at the courses of "'em"

top get a good like we're back
i have four of those remote
are we gonna have certain chips are gonna require a bigger size that period
it's in classes were produce a chip taking would be more expensive
make them are we ready so to speak
so i think having a key phrases much better
alright but it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say channel up and it would work right
one introduce in this way
good point

when have three presentations one from each
and then we're gonna close that we have
so it's classically retro so i mean that's just an idea
so i mean that's just an idea here is like a and
i don't know hang on
a row and the round once it's sort of feel by you know this factor one down a sort of things that sort of looking into
but i can also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five guys and you know double curved a wooden remote it's
thank you for those inform the presentations let's go back

you know you're in the dark you know wanna be looking at your remote control and
and the picture particularly is point if you look at the top volume button it's a v. and so you
a v. and so you kinda feeling a v. like volume up what it really is a v.
at it if you have be quite a section for the main controls there you
selling point
they voice activation would be good
no we just wanted to be a finder
meaning that design

advanced so if you wanna do that but if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control them
but then you have you could i did do it by race type which
race type which could be you know if she
but i we have to look at whites our production cost is for the chip itself anyway
and it is the current trend the higher technological like
did i mean just like the more advanced it is

that would be to grow richer so would actually
us to this looks but if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost
do we wanna go for battery is or a stand like the one that we saw go straight at earlier
i was still like first to wanna know what it looks like for "'cause"
we do a voice activated locator though we're gonna have been looking at a more substantial chip so
you double a.s and so yes

they want fifty percent of the decision of what it should look like they have to versus functional and then
and then it has to also be technologically innovative and yet easy to use so
rather than like a hard click e. button that you final like some mobiles and you like a soft or touch i mean you guys
but if we have that the locator or do we do have to worry about that
in these simple one so you showed us there is one that had the scroll buttons on the side which

so that being said next slide
so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed we need rubber for buttons
"'cause" we know how big it's gonna be and how heavy
tracker
'cause that a wide type of for voice activation

fibreglass something copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself
they suggested power options solar cells hand dynamo in kinetic power so you shake
power so you shake it and in creases the power i'm not have
i'm not have a hand dynamo work say that to get back to be on
lot of options i don't think wood is a viable option and

so depends on what we decide we wanna do in addition
like a double curved in rubber you know each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options so we'll
can it be all sweetness certain way or
that's kind what you say
if it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would you know technology

just kind of mine idea
corny would demonstrate the
trend watching
so trendwatching

that's one of work he calls or rubber product
you know what happens i've had three watches
are we gonna go with the voice activated
'cause i'm pretty we can get them pretty cheap on bulk

'cause they're all killed older generation and
there's the idea of like be able to do it by feel as as by by site you know you're
either that or just have it by shape for example you have
is that second are there i

interface concept know
and he manufacturing division also has said that they have several types of chips and they've just developed
so what kind of material do we want to be
pieces everywhere

i copied mind before it is sent to do
looking at the
looking at the interface concept is gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this if you wanna
can i say place to possible ways on the left

again one more slide know it and
bigger than the base that just seems
for plastic or what would you recommend for materials
honestly i'd recommend like since we're going

let's go ahead and start off with your presentations would like to go
ipod's becoming really fast thing and so
really fast thing and so you have this sort of very simplistic menu section with the round buttons and that's

touch i mean you guys know i mean
looks like it
so would actually if you the shape of your hand you curve here in you curve here so you could have two curves and that's the shape of the hand to make it more palatable to whole know

for example you have a specific triangular shape it you know you're looking at the up and down a row and
because if people would just be talking and we don't want to one off all the time
really trying to because i know that's it's only gonna be big because it's

and down at the bottom you have the logo is not
thank you personal preferences to save money
and we don't have multiple things i have to control just as control the t. v. it's not gonna be

it'll be copy of component design
transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the t. v.s sender which interprets a signal responds accordingly changes channel et cetera so
next slide please thank you

so basic remote operation runs as as press
we need to decide also we can figure out how big it's gonna be like exactly what buttons we wanna and exactly
what's as a battery

except it's sort of arnold
and the question is does that mean that the user then have to ask the specific question and can change it in order for it to be recogniser can it be
like using the menu to be like in your name into the screen like on the menu options of the way

so you say about like what if we use our sales try and then at all gonna reach a colour or is it gonna
a colour or is it gonna be the kind of thing where people come back and swap it
could you run off of two

a few months because i mean
i mean i could just be a spring thing right now

no i mean it could be the arrows are red or for channel up and down and then put the numbers around
and then put the numbers around in like it will fashion dial shape "'cause" they're all killed

and that's sort of like you have the base of the kinda trendy it had but also very sleek and and very simple but technologically advanced so
so it's got a limited memory into to programming so

this particularly geared towards children
sake you know we could call it

you know we could call it changed to yellow bright yellow for like a bad for the company logo you
you have the shapes that's a simplistic and friendly looking

the moment particularly keen on by the way
all those basic things that make a circuit function fibreglass

so you press the button a produces a signal it's encoded specifically for that button transistors amplify
that thing is like it even if it's got a few buttons we want it to be bigger than a as a "'cause" it's still

contact disks for the buttons plastic for the casing and the power source whatever power
right but would you recommend

we're now for options for casing such as straight curved double curved you know very specific to the
very specific to the customer options for materials

options for materials plastic rubber titanium what do i don't
do i don't think anyone's gonna go forward one because splinters

one so if they want so what i saw squishy rubber or they can't have the solar powered option double curved
i kinda brings us to this looks

pushbutton requires a simple shape and scroll requires more complicated chip so
but you can you're kinda department

the sample sensor and sample speaker unit for a so
for a so you say like good morning coffee maker and it would respond good morning jo but

but like you know if we get more complicated than it's gonna have to be bigger to just a comedy the chip size
did you come back and bite the extra case so we could do like

titanium it's as saying
it's as saying the titanium if we're being restricted than i'm we away from them

are we are structured by this
are because and then with the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it

and i think it's good to sell basic thing and then sell options
so we could do like a hard base plastic and then we could to give to latex covers to start

'kay here's the agenda for today's meeting

let's go ahead and

would like to go first

it's sense we do put the fashion in electronics it is kind of important how what our product box so i we

so i we know how to the next so

the next so what they wanna right

what they wanna right now customers what fancy versus functional

about fifty per cent of what they like of the product

what they like of the product that they want describing like the in order of how much they want fifty percent

is confusions they don't know exactly what they want us to

so we know next

i don't know really i mean i spongy

but as for the fruit and vegetable patterns i don't know if we really want to go with that because it is

and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months because

people don't buy a new remote every so often

and also buttons all the meeting point and she said that in your design

she said that in your design with the ball

with the ball but

older generation and like separate rooms call so it's

i don't know hang on interface concept

interface concept is new

on the left if you see it on the sides of the remote you have to sort of scroll down so you have that option right

so you have that option right there and then also this the idea

that sort of like an idea there and then

and then on the right you have what's really big trend right now is the ipod's becoming

in a remote control them sort of look into it but

sort of old-fashioned in a way either that

the sort of example of going for a certain demographic

and then the other thing that would be able to do is just to probe be a be programme certain

i like it away from other channels is

i mean these are three examples sort of looking at it if you have

you could see how many buttons are and

are and then on the left you have an example of the round buttons and simpler design on the

on the bottom we probably wouldn't need that is

you have the logo is not we could put the r. real reaction

and then finally so like that sort of same examples but also some

but it's sort of like just taking aspect of it and say i have this one we like you know the round section of or with like the buttons size and this

or i like you know the black finish this over finish or whatever

as press a button and makes a connection with the power source nurse the circuit chip senses

chip senses the connection to produces morse

to produces morse code infrared signal specific to that button so

next slide please

findings wall which were the required materials for the basic internal construction so all the really

we need rubber for buttons known for battery contacts integrated circuit which consists of a diode transistor resonator resistors and a capacitor all

and l. e. d. which is a light emitting diode contact

source whatever power source we've actually to turn and we want next slide

that to get back to be on that so

that so you next slide please so

so just in casing option it's we're now

that'll be amazing that that splinters

double curved you can't do titanium that

know if you wanna that you can do titanium and suggested

suggested functions for the buttons scrolling function could be very beneficial to us in stead of actual buttons themselves again one more slide

so we'll have to make setup make we produce enough of everyone but i can

that's the thing or time earlier

right except it's

all sweetness certain way or just the actual user programme and to say channel mean to us

if you like voice recognition would be i don't know we too hard to really i mean we could do

we are making the chip so

i think we'd have to decide on the power options maybe so that we could reduce

the base

'cause it's still fits in your hand see still wanna something that's comfortable on substantial but not necessarily full of buttons

this one is really comparable like i like

like i like the sides whatever because

you're gonna lose it easier

honestly i think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did you do

if we did you do a small compact

i'm away from the pace

that just seems clunky and

because i mean if even looking at cell phones right now those trends the smaller the harder it is

smaller and smaller

palm of that is you forget to take a river park it in person

phone or that would require a part heard

we have a lot of options i don't think

however we only wanna sell

we only wanna sell it for twenty five euro right

'cause i was thinking if we wanted to get the high end market then you could produce if you in titanium make them are we

that they has or research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if

good point

since we're going with batteries instead of solar power i would recommend maybe a us off to a latex because

and then if x. array stripes or solids you know

or we could like take off this

think we should do voice i think we should just do the recognition for one is lost you know we could

we could give it a specific code you know remote missing

and what size batteries double a. or triple a.

i mean more work on a package

'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite and most other electronic products right so they're

and they also have a longer battery life the most batteries but if you have to replace

which i think if we make it curved is like a hand shape like if we put that the scroll button on the side that could be particularly

that could be particularly useful

the scroll buttons on the side and the buttons on top
