i mean i spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to do rather than like
where we put the buttons around like we put a big on off button or something else no i mean it
you could see how many buttons are and
are and then on the left you have an example of the round buttons and simpler design on the
that thing is like it even if it's got a few buttons we want it to be bigger than a as a "'cause" it's still
are because and then with the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it
maybe on off button something so the menu button i don't
twelve all that was the button do and
i think you're going to get a lot of i mean the final say what buttons but i'll

i think maybe putting another button is probably a good idea
i'm just really where is the putting anything on a button

do we finalise what buttons or including or
buttons or including or did we just everything that we said before

honestly i think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did you do
i'm kind of leaning in that direction of this kind of
so what kind of material do we want to be
right or not titanium i kind of
i kind of like that look but worth it was
kind of grey
is kind of difficult to see we have like a sort of division between the bottom like where the logo is and if we
like a little cut out kind of

so you press the button a produces a signal it's encoded specifically for that button transistors amplify
some of those buttons that are blue based all
with the button is actually blue but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would all the make yellow so
yellow so blue and yellow for the touch buttons

if it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would you know technology
what kind of chip would we need for this guy

on the left if you see it on the sides of the remote you have to sort of scroll down so you have that option right
pushbutton requires a simple shape and scroll requires more complicated chip so
it might be the four way scroll to i mean it if
in these simple one so you showed us there is one that had the scroll buttons on the side which
which i think if we make it curved is like a hand shape like if we put that the scroll button on the side that could be particularly
the scroll buttons on the side and the buttons on top
know if we have scroll thing on the side we definitely have time labelled
there are so is that sort of a scroll you just have the buttons are on the side which are on the side

they want fifty percent of the decision of what it should look like they have to versus functional and then
look into it but anyway next
for example you have a specific triangular shape it you know you're looking at the up and down a row and
you have the shapes that's a simplistic and friendly looking
i was still like first to wanna know what it looks like for "'cause"
or if we're going for the right or a look i think like a really shiny black would be
yes just looking examples you just don't ever see the logo on a button at all was on the actual casing

a row and the round once it's sort of feel by you know this factor one down a sort of things that sort of looking into
that sort of looking into how we want to do it by feel
i kinda brings us to this looks
going to do the ideas going to do the look and feel design the u. i. d.

and the picture particularly is point if you look at the top volume button it's a v. and so you
the problem is we're using latex over listen to it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons so i was thinking

just kind of mine idea
so it's classically retro so i mean that's just an idea
then also this the idea of the base that sort of like an idea
so again it's sort of like just give you ideas and down at the bottom
i kind of like your idea about the right true phone dial and
yellow i like that idea
i like the yellow elimination idea he good
any other ideas or parts

all others but that would be useful kind of
be useful kind of

to produces morse code infrared signal specific to that button so

next slide please
next slide please thank you
next slide please just talking
that so you next slide please so

so you have that option right there and then also this the idea
as if we find another company you can produce the required chips casing l. e. d. any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate then we are cells are producing we should go for
so just in casing option it's we're now
very specific to the customer options for materials
like using the menu to be like in your name into the screen like on the menu options of the way
i thought you are offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different you know i think we'd
lot of options i don't think wood is a viable option and
and i think it's good to sell basic thing and then sell options
