but i think we can all make the fronts of titanium or something you really thin so it looks very
do you see a bit of the of that titanium or on the front and

and play it over it may be in a colour or something that looks of

is but it doesn't look strong so maybe
that it should be harder and strong looking at the likes of materials
it's got a strong look this
stronger as if you look at this it doesn't look very strong become
but it doesn't have to look strong the
to look strong the results are the feel of the material is expected to be strongly the feel
so it looks pretty but it feels strong
it does look strong
give that strong look in

you maybe you should have some courts titanium or something so it looks

so you have a menu button and
menu button and then you can go up to now
and what's the menu button
this button can also be the menu button using menus
using menus we can add another button here but
no we should i and it's a menu button and
it's a menu button and this the button
once you have an extra menu button you don't need that extra option

that's something you have to take a look at and
that looks of really flashy way
so it looks very heavy but you
but we still have to look at our price of course because
though it's plastic it's great to give it a i would look it's
because if you make grey or silver looking it does make it a lot more does make looking at lot more stronger as if
then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make
but it mustn't look too childish of course and
then look at so it's few and me to show

when you wanna other colour on the front it doesn't match
colour and it doesn't really matter if you have a purple front on it or or thought i don't

not on the front side of it on the but as you
the front side no slogan

pretty tough but it doesn't have a really tough look so
no but i think this looks a pretty a few of course

and of course you have to do the plastic front end but you also
titanium jack plastic front

so i mean we might call send it consider front of in that sort of way of
the front as the most important
front so are cheaper than one of those
the front somewhere
machine that it's the same thing with another front so
that's for later on the front seat you can do anything with that
the most boring fronts possible
you can the logo can be on every front
it is and things like that when you are changeable fronts and it's open

the buttons for screen with and channel settings and that's been and that's kind of and
this must maybe button use to interact with the l. c. d. screen in with this you

for the normal removable a part
or on the front and maybe if we make it this lower part that in this you the front
in this you the front is the opera part and the
we can do that but then you have two parts of fronts do from the
and then the lower part of titanium

that's also the button based
the button based on this you should have

that you know the it did in is very basic colour and it doesn't really
so and then i've got a couple of basic colours not very
and wrote you can have some basic colours and
can have some basic colours and then we come with a special patterns on them and
