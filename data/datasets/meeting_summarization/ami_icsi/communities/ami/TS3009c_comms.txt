manual to first look at your presentations right
i think we have to go for the first one is
so i mean we might call send it consider front of in that sort of way of
of furthermore material that you're part should be very strong i was thinking of something
that looks of really flashy way
buttons of course rubber i think in one piece
think in one piece let's go cables copper is all pretty basic to the
of course that's not a red things use so this
and then we have a young and dynamic people which
people which is of course our group people we aim at
and the cheap so we
you left so if i say hi mike and you have recorded a high might back then you will get that
but that makes it cheap it's if it's just a
next year that out
yellow and
this little buttons are a bit difficult to jewell correct
but how do you get out of the menu then

point is just two times less important
technolo show technological innovations that's regarded very highly to
earlier so we have to have something like that it's likely
you can make it very complicated the remote anyway so
but the most important thing is that it looks great and people say four
and people say four that's true great a great concept right
right this is a are the new colours of this year so it
people like this
we want young people so
people so we're gonna do and the rounds we're gonna
we're gonna have real go shapes and lots of colours right
properties is so the different components of the of the device in a material
or maybe it is but it doesn't look
it's still has to look
and is rounds
but then you're losing your fruity colours
the remote control i don't think that's very practical

the feel
you maybe you should have some courts titanium or something so it looks
i'm you've all or monologue not playing one book style but
i'll draw it but maybe later and it
and it makes it it gives them or you use in the shape and if you have
anyway as the for the buttons simple push buttons know where all the lion
know where all the lion know difficult scroll things are somewhat it's things like that because it makes more complex
and as we we don't use a speaker a stranger speak speech or controls device because it makes it
but we do we use an l. c. d. screens or
but it's worth the trouble i think because
because people like that

we should change that
i suggest a banana shape
this must maybe button use to interact with the l. c. d. screen in with this you
yes but you get because when you would push menu you get in and
that's also the button based
they do they don't look fruity enough
do we remote terrible
and of course you have to do the plastic front end but you also
titanium jack plastic front
i think that's a trade off

that it should be harder and strong looking at the likes of materials
but i should all this if it's the works
and then blows the l. c. d. screen
you need to uni the speaker
how to use all the kind of the way it works
titanium or heart some kind of metal for the the whole remote except the front that
the plastic is the colour you want it
that they had titanium is it isn't a very it

so we have to think in this direction so
if you use to curved case a curved case double curved a new can't use titanium now and
and they are already been used on the coffee machines and
the buttons should be position and positioned the same way as they are conventional remotes i think for the
of control now
then the whole then the ball
i think we can lines a couple of packages you can buy

fruity fruit
but you can menu you can press menu again to be enough
you know a redundancy
but it mustn't look too childish of course and
i don't know i know it's too expensive
that's too expensive thing

they will start again it's not
rights trendwatch
people didn't like that so our new mum model must be very good looking that's
that's something you have to take a look at and
it's a generate the case at the senior and see people above forty five years old like if you set up the d. v. d. a traditional materials s. citizen board and but there is that it

are that looks like you
to look strong the results are the feel of the material is expected to be strongly the feel
it's all too much buttons too many buttons
it's all take we
have to have i will design it

it's terrible alright
that we must decide where it is meeting and there
menu button and then you can go up to now
and if we decide to to implement that when you should
it's that could be anywhere that's very small

we'll take that and then mike
but pressing the menu but then again by pressing the menu button again
course the you have the best of both worlds
like this or you feel titanium
the front so

very great and also the menus and things like that they have to have two great
though it's plastic it's great to give it a i would look it's
is more like you can talk to the chip recorded message and record an answer and then
with you can also say that when you say something it does some function

suggestion l. c. d. screen speech or ignorance and as we talked about earlier so
so it isn't very important that's it that it works easy but where it has
no titanium
this is my suggestion is design

functional is not an issue and then easy to use we have to choose one
we have to choose one on them
but where it has to look great
the g. electrical cable is just normal

fruit and vegetables are called i'm told
i'm told the group we are
that's the design the l. c. d. screen is i think we should
up all that although

use so this is things we must not do and then we have a young
just a hunch
apart button because you want to to use it falls within one click
and what's the menu button

of appears is of course again and it's a contradiction with our materials choice of what you said that it should
so we might we have to consider that and
have to consider that and also the like curves round shapes shown not to
shown not to do for more like the older people want and that is

sports there but i just want on your l. c. d. we know where the
that's the design the
any colour and
going to my source so it's still be possible to make an entire and you taking is available and then we can make an entire remote out of it if you want

all beginning results
yes understand but that
i have they are controlled again and i
but are you going for strange say form

we keep coming back to the front
i these are the basic older people
very classical looking but the thing that's not
so to give you an idea of

shapes it's very primary colours bright colours round shapes you also
that's the information i received if you use to
now and there's other to give them or more than look and
front i'm

become but this is plastic and this too much
right and speak at the back or something
the trendwatching sell as you said fruit used in that probably sells
colours and they only use the notes

we have to decide all this thing
just like most cell phones are
of course that they really have to make decision
i so pretty much i think

of course klux
material
the buttons are normal etcetera

shelf
a have to if you finding from a few findings
and where is the recording the microphone or would

we should take so this time the exactly know what's to decide about and scandal
we don't want but all the people we want young
you also see this device so very round and fruity of

it's very important that the control is a fancy looking and goats the feeling
fruity of course it's
and round shapes primary colours you can

remote anyway so ease of use it's not very calm too complicated by
year so it must be very bright very colourful people like this
all the people like dark colours a simple shapes we don't want

again i it's a output of the specification properties is
pretty tough but it doesn't have a really tough look so
but we still have to look at our price of course because

way to do with an infrared letters just a simple ball but
because it makes more complex and expensive
i will drawl what i have drawn on the screen

i don't know what exactly they are that looks like
our customers will use those funky an attorney colours and
funky customers alright

so those kind of things you can combine
we can do really make the rounds the remote control i
the second is that you can use know titanium that's the

cheap so we could use them no
the trend watching
what do we think that fruit and bright colours are

a voice recognition can be implement that
again and i know what i did wrong i didn't take the
we have our beautiful drawing

then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make
and i think as you can see so the l. c. d. screen doesn't better thirteen over and i have to but that
i agree

it a kind of bridge
so we have to put it in one and document
we're going for a titanium back and the plastic from

very that's that feels comfortable
it's from our coffee
the chip is normal to become

they specific shape
cover or just a bit basic
all that although inside work of our remote is a standard work so

i case and that's me i suggest
me i suggest
you have the remote in your hand like this or

just easy we decide about that just by looking at our competitors an hour or earlier remotes the conceptual
the conceptual specification of the user interface
you can put that in in to the shared folder and then i'll put

because if we have as much time as the last meeting we'll have to hurry up i'll start
colour and it doesn't really matter if you have a purple front on it or or thought i don't

that i'll show them we'll
show them we'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design

and scandal close again
at and the feeling has to be very great and also

l. c. d. and down or fronts
so it looks very heavy but you

the last point is easy to use i think that's
i don't know who's who's going to look at that

and play it over it may be in a colour or something that looks of
on there are four or five years old

among the old people a
all people so that's it for me

we should move to something
is but it doesn't look strong so maybe

hard pressed it is of course a pretty tough but
remote it's the this it's a bit much and i else is

findings the target audience products out
old they like soft materials with primary colours of appears

primary colours you can see the way and of course these
and of course these things device he's give you

because if you make grey or silver looking it does make it a lot more does make looking at lot more stronger as if
stronger as if you look at this it doesn't look very strong become

l. c. d. screens or we we do have to consider of we have to use the more advanced chip which is more
which is more complex and expensive but

their i soft enough so that's the
do an example but it did not work quite the the way i want to do

but it's for young people they
young people of the

so we should really a include that one i think
so you put a menu in the l. c.

just the numbers
corp cover it is

these will be bigger in the real design
this button can also be the menu button using menus

the button based on this you should have
or you can put in the l. c. d.s what we know an option get out

move out
i have some examples you can

they're all black
and then one night

no i did too expensive
because we can then look at

so it falls over the hands
i dunno if you know than a nokia telephone with the rounds a thing at the bottom so something like that

a breach it's just a half around the house of a circle and then it's
and then it's false exactly only hands and that's

our sources
these are a few examples which we have to decide about all that the

where no that's more like the buttons where the f. to com and them
it doesn't cares no

probably sells good
i understand

what do i suggest actually why
what's what kind of property should have

do you know the new
plastic and you can put it on and off and switch

to show material and hard plastic for the front
and then pending in for the back

or thought i don't know if you disagree but i think it's
but i think it's doesn't matter very much

machine that it's the same thing with another front so
you can also implement because implement fronts from movies that are very heart

let's begin because if we

i'll start with the presentation again the agenda

i'll show you the notes it's not as

it's not as interesting it should be because of it's

should be because of it's the at the meeting that i'll

then we'll have to be easy to decide about the control for the remote control concepts i've

i've put of a file in the project management folder which says exactly up what kind decisions we should take so

this are some examples was will

some examples was will talk about the manual to first

speak about latest trends chance latest fashion updates and

updates and things we must not do

the trends it's very

but this because all for our last model was very functional was

was that it people didn't like that so

there's the minus the two times here because this is the most important point is

right the last

use i think that's the speech forty for itself i don't

easy to use i think that you know

easy to use this is a bit to come to dictionary with the first functional

go for the first one is the most important one so we have today

so we have today we have to they get one

something fancy looking can be easy to use

we look at

so it's set to mind to it findings

findings fashion updates fruit and vegetables

the group we are targeting is a very pleased with fruit and vegetables so i

the number of

i was thinking of something like i and play it over it may

really flashy way that it is also strong and that's

and that's also for the younger public

there anything about our phones that we can afford is trendy at every it did is

every it did is it's fruits but

it's fruits but next year it's something different

but i think we can all make the fronts of titanium or something you really thin so it looks very

heavy but you can still use it's very easy

the don'ts all the people

would use proper

price shell as

right i'm going to tell you something about the components design

in a material so i first of all things so

first of all things so i i have to change that way

i use it just sits there in the previous meeting hard plastic but issue

but issue indicate it it should be strong should feel

stronger a plastic is not sufficient we should move to

because if you want an l. c. d. we know etcetera

we tend to have the

to have the buttons of course rubber i

basic to the chip made of silicon i

i thing is the best way to do with an infrared

that it also like straightforward shapes and it is style of course that's

people we aim at

at the likes of materials

and that is also fine but not very at applicable here at sporting gaming device as such as this man for drawing and those kind advise a game devised should define the characteristics of the device but since we

but since we don't have a really a sports again device so we don't really have to consider

sort of fronts

and i also have several examples of so you

so you can get a clear picture of what i mean

it was not very interesting know very classical looking

but the thing that's not what we want we have this kind

what we want we have this kind of things i don't know what exactly they

you know you recognise shapes it's very

he's give you a know something some slides like this so to give you

it's got a strong look this

you can make it that middle ring can you or you can make another colour so

but it's important to to think about the colour because if you make

but it doesn't have to look strong the

feel alright

and it doesn't have to be strong or the only thing

so it looks pretty but it feels strong

and kinetic and dynamos and i'm not very practical i think for for a simple remote it's the

and i else is just the as the shape a double curved case

what do exactly mean we double curved

more than look and now the shape i found it curved case

i think as a sort a triangle shape the bottom or something i'm

i'll draw it but

because it makes it also more complex and expensive but we do we use an

the buttons can be made of an soft material

use of material thing from

some rubber it's a sort of their i

so that's the basic what i want to talk about

alright we'll take that and

none of the we will include the buttons as we discussed earlier

an l. c. d. is screen will be implement that

and there are new developments in speech recognition systems and they

it's not really speech recognition is more

an answer and then once you talk to the remote and he will at all so with the pre recorded message that you left so if i say

it's if it's just a extra function and it's cheap

but that has no function of our remote at all

no but that's to get is they wanted again it's

i tried to young people of

as i said it earlier i think be l. c. d. screens of the positions the lower end of the remote

the buttons for screen with and channel settings and that's been and that's kind of and

we can also do that's kind of functions be shown in the l. c. d. screen and instead of extra buttons i think the

i think the young people and if the user would like that

i think for the learnability and

learnability and keep it recognisable a voice recognition

and i do an example but

cared run out of control

how hard

i didn't take the notebook box and then don't know

how do you give input to the menu on the l. c. d. screen

with the the up and down and the buttons and

so you have a menu button and

but then we should also have an an button

me that there is already a blank yes

a blank yes

because of the fruity fashion

those are the change the channel buttons of course

screen in with this you can yes go to through the menus and

the video buttons should be an apart button because

using menus we can add another button here but

by pressing the menu button again you go how to use

you get in and then you have to push when you're gets to what choice and

no we should i and it's a menu button and

it's a menu button and this the button

once you have an extra menu button you don't need that extra option

this is a choice

but we need it we need the recording button for the speech a part of

a i i suggest here but that's just a

speaker and a microphone i think are the same little thingy

i understand

but we could sit they do with this has more expensive the speaker on the back or something

there are all already been implement that in coffee machine so they won't be

machine so they won't be very expensive

fine i move out

these are quite all these very ugly remote

no i don't do not trendy

this is the children but

it does look strong

but with the colour say it's a bit the way we're going to

this is a terrible

this crazy

has this looks

i think we should if it's a possible or one with colours that

know it's too expensive right

no i'm not very strange

'cause people like that

not too strange no

a sense you can make the on the side you can make it more round where the l. c. d. is

a kind of bridge so it

i have at home a remote with a breach it's

hands and that's very that's that

but people like something you know the

the different we use

i will design it we designed it later so we'll get to

so we'll get to that later i

conceptual face i think this is it

i got this from our friends sell

sell you the conceptual design

all that the materials from the case yet a cable that's all you are are side story

you're back

not from the user interface your i

and them the bit of mail a bit of a design

but we have to decide about these now and at

but we should decide now

at the trendwatching sell

material so it must not simple

this fact

copy pays the this story into into a word document and then i

document and then i put the on switch off to the subject

but isn't all these examples are of a coffee machine

we can overriding

why don't we news titanium or

so we have titanium

the front as the most important

the number movable elements of the remote so not the front could be taking into give that

give that strong look in

strong look in the front is made of plastic and you

and switch it

but the feel of plastic isn't strong

no but you have to titanium of course the you have

but you also have to titanium

front so are cheaper than one of those

and i don't know if you can make still just anyway you wanted to

but it's expensive

then you paint it in the colour you want the plastic is

then look at so it's few and me to show

for the normal removable a part

but then you have to problem but you have titanium back you can switch it when you wanna other

when you wanna other colour on the front it doesn't match

type things neutral

no i i then again it's very the notes

that you know the it did in is very basic colour and it doesn't really

and even if it does it doesn't match you doodle people like couldn't i gotta do math

you like to go cable that's no we

no we don't use an electric can be inside

but this is for the coffee machine

l. inside the remote control we use a couple of

that's not what's nancy

external of a

of a coffee grinder that they're

they're never mind covered right

so let's just easy

i'd rather than a one year and i will

than a one year and i will

shared folder

shared folder and then i'll put it in our and report

word is out so yes forty next meeting

you can put some which button is what's

the trend watching

the front somewhere

you can buy a different kind of all of machine that
