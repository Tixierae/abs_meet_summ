then we have to go to findings evaluation of the costs of these think and hopefully
and also the use of the base station for battery which charging and also to of course to got a lot more remote control when it is lost
you know to give it a quick look and feel
since before we are
like i like it may be the the thing that can be used me the less used they the more the functional buttons looks of it
and the volume but then we call on
it's up to you means not
means let's say this can move down the larger digits and this can move that's more digits
or can move between positioned and and the number
what about people who want to use these it's but
but we are buttons
so there was a constraint that the surface area which we have one to spend on one side because of the shape
so we are targeting a segment which is just really trendy kind of thing that they don't care about the buttons anymore
and it's cute a. d. a.'s we are lady it's a logic so
so and we must users must say it if it's true or is it or if it falls in a scale of ranging from zero to seven
because it should be an even you should be any then this day and five
let's that's about eight if it's fancy
i have to say four
all t. v.s but i made any t. v.s i
so it's you know so but forties
five four
so four point two or
this fall there's
there's an outline is sort of
'cause five seven so
are you are not like a clear seven
don't i yell at it

the whole n. c. d. no speech recognition technology we went for one
then as everywhere
so we have to go through now variations
i'd give it a six like that

so following you know decision to make dealer to make a banana
and we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana otherwise it's
otherwise it's you know a child comes and so
three i mean my remote control is gonna have time is pretty terrible if it was

when you stop scroll and the wheel it stops but normally with
but normally with you will just stay on each station briefly so you can see the picture
this is the teletext button so what you press that
and you can use the channel selector scroll-wheel was

i just going to quickly through the minutes of last the wiki get that we have
get that we have a presentation of what the type of you to sounds interesting
i really do have the solar cells are actually necessary anymore very charging base station

to navigate that's true teletext
not it's from one to seven is sort of for one to seven
all might be there's some other kind of thing but

maybe health and safety aspects
so folder possibles you still you what we want to usable sort of sense of batteries
but he's saying costs not production costs

we as reckon
if it was to have a remote control of my d. v. d. player from another none of them not be more inclined to put it
put it "'cause" it's really bad but i say three

of course of "'cause" the most difficult question for the end
i would say six it's
i think anybody all gonna say i did anyway you got a zero only let these last one is what is this

your video got a friend or something
worse than a banana
and they might not be out as easy as it is

six so it's a five point five more or less
would i change i would change my a week remote control from and the room and
i'd say three i

so is the agenda for today i
and hopefully that we should feeds that are get out of twelve point five you're

and this is the remote itself that's kind
what happened balls would be could be useful in the meetings with it

like that's attractive or a stage
because they last two questions as much more important than the rest actually otherwise

and for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this
you have to rebuild

it's it's about the weight of a banana
file the file gets but it did not so for a while

it'll be a lizard top somewhere there
you want to show the be a bulb and then you have

do it they've got the buttons changed see if they are function depending if it was teletext or not
so hello there

k. i. a. i can just i dissected that
i dissected that i used of the telly a base and they designer user requirements and it's cute a. d. a.'s

number
and five

i would say seven is quite fancy
so you can and seven plus six plus seven was

six point five
scroll-wheels but maybe was apart from not having you know the extra buttons when you real if you do need them to summarise but

i'll fall remote control that you had all the
twenty five euros

it's compared to the or
the standards what is available in the market not

this is a mini set a specific a sense
six it's quite cheap

i opened the narrow think it's pretty good to if i were to narrow but
no but it's very handy actually if you see it's

it's all handy and
but that's not a positive thing

it's a very positive thing if you see like that
it's handy it's ergonomic but it's a banana

there's i would buy this so
you want to flaunt your video got

it's funny
i think it kind of you just lose information if you some of the

afternoon again

so we should have our final meeting about the detailed design and off stage design of the product of the remote control

sounds interesting and we have

and we have a a presentation of a variation could say about all the marketing expert then we have to

if i go quickly to the minutes of last meeting

so we went through wood wood

wood to just forming decisions

we went for one to about the look-and-feel for the remote control we went through

we went through the use of wheels and the buttons and also

so but don't have these are wonderful thing

so we can go to the slides

number three number two

so final design and

can you show it to the the game our maybe

remote so

you can put it out first and

we've first that's all we made a an attractive base station with a banana leaf a look-and-feel on and

is it that sits in x. and also is that's not good at a time and

the remote itself that's kind of it's ergonomic if it's in the hand we've got to

we've got to scroll-wheels which you know one

which you know one on the dollar for the volume and one for channel and

and underneath we have the the tell a button which is in like a

which is in like a that read a position for enough for pressing can actually

what the use of that's terrible button already

this is when you scrolling the through the channels you can tell it to skip past channels that you quickly brother

hi and then you stop when you stop it stops

and we do have one more functionality if you take

if you take the banana a search and you press the double working so it's which was star search on so t. v.

a two that other button

that other button so rather than having

so rather than having an extra button for for the on off switch we'd just use that a lot

so what you press that then you get teletext and you can use the channel

to navigate

but if you want to to base a hundred

with the wheel it's easy

then you can you have like a little a number selection thing you press that's the

you press that's the teletext button to move between the field and you can

the field and you can the scroll the number back and forth so it has you carry you scroll to seven and then there is your and then you can

stand and

stand and everything but

you can press the first teletext button and then you can

and then you can all be control

so then both the scroll buttons they have for teletext closing

and you can tell it

one to present any data and then the scroll buttons more for telly takes the normal for channel or volume

and this is the the infrared paul

also the top of the non sound and then we have

sound and then we have in the

in the and the base station we have the button up from for for calling the the no

that's that's that's form and function in the one no object

so it always means whatever the race goes bank they get reflected and then you're having a better coverage it's like

coverage it's like antennas

that's let's just like that's attractive

and this and the basic station is going to have that as input from the on line for charging the battery it's

is it really is it night

is it night or

so i and i understand

i think a child try to eat it anyway so maybe

consider that maybe health

to do you are you going to raise them

it falls got play some put them on the top yes and that's like you know that like that but

you have enough so face you're

that like that but i would i think it's necessary to have this also signal

because now we have a rechargeable batteries so

but would be the attorney or three

i made a long does it on our own could be help of a station

hold on that all hold on the batteries no

a three then a good ten hours

no i think in it should be weeks

the most ignore most of the time it's

ignore most of the time it's not been used

but you people don't like to put it back in a base station all the time people we wanna leave it on the couch so

so when you are making it on

not a don't a dark then as of looking if you're just leaving like

if you're just leaving like that it would be much longer

and we are having the speakers regular chip for control pricing

chip for control pricing is was the fact that so that's where we are one put a regular chip or may not the advanced chip

good that this is not evaluate but it sounds like it as

looks of it

you want to have more functional buttons

looks of it as a and i had

you're not convinced

not too many we want to keep it simple so that

simple so that those buttons that's what the latex which is usually also the case that

that usually there is a teletext button and to press that the channel buttons they about to become the scrolling buttons

because we have is that a lot coffee waste on this kind of a

it's all on top

that's what do we have a living in a wonderful or

automatically come to a word

you elections

so your slides already

why this strange factor of seven

usually have seen that scares out from one to ten right

if the solar and nineties too long

fine good idea

it's not you know to have enough granularity it's you

it's you know to have enough because i'm not married t. v. that issue

the body as use mean it's it is mean i'm

i'm answering your question

and that's a k. i found more useful i

useful i think it at and i could like the k. and the on the whiteboard and we or for

and we or for a whole range

so you can say fancy

it's fancy according to me

seven but

so that six

seven button

no a minute it's a seven

or five

minute it's a seven five

maybe find it maybe six it's it's

six it's it's useful to

and in any of seven

it a six like that i think it's probably more handy that my car remote "'cause" of the scroll-wheels but maybe

so and so than six

depends when you say functional do you mean it does what we wanted to do or that does what because you know gonna make a coffee

actually i dunno whatever the video is just to get some far off or you knew that so remote control

was not a universal remote then would focus

then would focus was that the focus to some t. v.s

i it's not that you know that but it's for all kind of t. v.s

thoughts for

device

it may scroll features and i new features that right

for a t. v. the most important feature which have it was the locator which is a quick feature and then the scroll buttons

and then the scroll buttons are reading would features we don't have a c. d. for

we don't have a c. d. for it but that we decided we don't want

i would say five

six i think

i think seven so it's

does that sound

definitely easy to use

definitely seven

five

a clear seven

alright now here's the sixty million dollar question twenty

twenty five euro question

calls all buy them in common

sheep

i find it quite cheap actually i don't know if

i don't know if it did as if you live in switzerland really thin

so that i get price use it for your call you for each country's it's more like

i don't know what they need to have the sufficient work for the whole room or you rub or

it is handy it's handy but it's terrible i

but i'll get a lot of the file gets

i if you would be young

actually i like a teenager function

feel like you're crazy teenager and you like to find a single

say two i don't think at any stage in my life i would wanna banana remote control really

crazy

i can say maybe there is a market for it either

but i say five

so what do you question

so it depends if

is that a physical a sense if you

a sense if you read any that's a remote control all the you would change your remote control for that for anyone

it has to be fashion

if i had that if i had to spend twenty five euro is that was like mile that maybe a lot but because the other

because the other twenty five your remote control probably gonna look

this is kind of thing that handy to use

so when i was read

i think two five

although it still has the word of course at the beginning so i

i was likely a six

what six alright

three so are

i give it a four now

six

six five four

six five four

so and last question would i change i would change

i set up a two

so give it a five

two three five and two so that's true

no romantic interlude i would say

so it's we had three point five

triple and five

i was this at five

why do you say five ease of that later

no i said five

not very promising but you know when i can't read this

we should have sound like that

maybe we should do have a look you know there you go

otherwise we will then we would not so

is there some for me you're using this is you have to sum up

an ion correct

it's clear that then

so maybe they would we can we should just take to a giraffe eating we can have the the help of these numbers which is that we should go for it

when we've gonna cost

so it so let's move on sound

sound no we have to on to his teammates at the costs so

so i prepare an exchange next sheet

while going to calculate the production cost we should

we should be below twelve point five
