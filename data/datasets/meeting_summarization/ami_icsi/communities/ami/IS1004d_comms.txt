that other button so rather than having
so rather than having an extra button for for the on off switch we'd just use that a lot

and this is the remote itself that's kind
the remote itself that's kind of it's ergonomic if it's in the hand we've got to
was not a universal remote then would focus

this is the teletext button so what you press that
so what you press that then you get teletext and you can use the channel
to navigate that's true teletext
you press that's the teletext button to move between the field and you can
you can press the first teletext button and then you can
so then both the scroll buttons they have for teletext closing
that usually there is a teletext button and to press that the channel buttons they about to become the scrolling buttons

and underneath we have the the tell a button which is in like a
what the use of that's terrible button already
simple so that those buttons that's what the latex which is usually also the case that
so we are targeting a segment which is just really trendy kind of thing that they don't care about the buttons anymore
no we have to push buttons
so form and whatnot button supplements right
my fact couldn't we couldn't see the these buttons but then to prevent because
people in the in milan and in paris and then again a button and

six it's it's useful to
six point five
it a six like that i think it's probably more handy that my car remote "'cause" of the scroll-wheels but maybe
six it's quite cheap
six
six five four
six five four
six so it's a five point five more or less

so we should have our final meeting about the detailed design and off stage design of the product of the remote control
we went for one to about the look-and-feel for the remote control we went through
i'll fall remote control that you had all the
actually i dunno whatever the video is just to get some far off or you knew that so remote control
a sense if you read any that's a remote control all the you would change your remote control for that for anyone
three i mean my remote control is gonna have time is pretty terrible if it was
if it was to have a remote control of my d. v. d. player from another none of them not be more inclined to put it
so maybe you should we should do kinda evaluation in the streets like asking to in people's you like to have a button of the remote control
some more tender our remote control instead of just for causing on the on t. v.

no a minute it's a seven
minute it's a seven five
'cause five seven so

and hopefully that we should feeds that are get out of twelve point five you're
because it should be an even you should be any then this day and five
five four
two three five and two so that's true
so it's we had three point five
triple and five
why do you say five ease of that later
no i said five
we should be below twelve point five

then we have to go to findings evaluation of the costs of these think and hopefully
to bring that cost
it cost is creating so we have
to reduce the cost that
it's probably actually cost more than three if
but you know that other button does add that extra cost
the cost of the thing can be made more than might be a good reading it's just
a good reading it's just optimal what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to

but he's saying costs not production costs
while going to calculate the production cost we should

it may scroll features and i new features that right
for a t. v. the most important feature which have it was the locator which is a quick feature and then the scroll buttons
and then the scroll buttons are reading would features we don't have a c. d. for

scroll-wheels but maybe was apart from not having you know the extra buttons when you real if you do need them to summarise but
mean we have is to push buttons and to scroll wheel so we really need
scroll wheel so we really need an integrated circuit to

we went through the use of wheels and the buttons and also
and you can use the channel selector scroll-wheel was
with the wheel it's easy
we have to scroll then we have three put the buttons
we didn't think it's not about to the united the scroll-wheel pushbuttons
but i thought you know because you could potentially united be pushing it down as you scroll it for the senate other but you know that other button does
so we can go to scroll to project evaluation

and we do have one more functionality if you take
that's that's that's form and function in the one no object
like i like it may be the the thing that can be used me the less used they the more the functional buttons looks of it
you want to have more functional buttons
do it they've got the buttons changed see if they are function depending if it was teletext or not
because we have is that a lot coffee waste on this kind of a
depends when you say functional do you mean it does what we wanted to do or that does what because you know gonna make a coffee
actually i like a teenager function

hold on that all hold on the batteries no
so we stick a battery one
ahead so we used only have one for battery and
the data the battery
extra battery
