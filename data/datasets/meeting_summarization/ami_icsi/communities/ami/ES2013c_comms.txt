about it we all need a remote but
need a remote but the person who was really perhaps active in personalising i'm thinking a teenager the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get us off covers

what we can have scroll buttons and
and the scroll-button can incorporate the porch so you can
you can have multiple scroll buttons this is
a little bit more for regular chip and you can have scroll buttons if
c. d. screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons and it could
do you want scroll buttons are not as

i push these buttons here
we don't have something that push is a little buttons that
something like that and push two select like
which it means a flat plastic case and what we battery and simple push buttons or
but we can implement it was simple push buttons which is much cheaper
which i think technically is just push button and i said he spoke
i'd like push buttons where
so push buttons

on that's the back of the interface
what is the interface look like
we have a fancy interface designs got when i'm afraid
as the interface we can't do anything fancy a
so we so i thought i showed you for my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available
so i was thinking that out a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things are not and then
and it says interface what are you and what's supplements

if it's like the covers that they use for the remote it's you tell yourself
in most families don't isn't the remote use a remote
v.s and they would have a remote for each one so
as it so if you just wanna sit there and shoo on the remote they could be like pear flavour
this is a remote that's been opened up on that's the
but i lost legally taken with this chunky plastic katie remote
perhaps something reminiscent of the child's remote do you think we could

that this will increase the cost the electronics
if you want the advanced chip you don't use it costs more but it that's
really cheap model people what we costs down which it
one for should have been have cost information you in
but does depend how much i mean how much it costs and how much more development and research and it's
but i could market that as a there's a if i was thinking actually a costing me down the road in terms of battery you know
about that brings the cost down quite a lot and it's something

but they scroll like a computer mikes so
do you can scroll on another show
half hour you scroll up and you see
and so on that you can just much in the same way as an existing scary remote scroll on scroll up and down and
i was saying it and not actually scroll way to like a scroll but you know up
scroll but is hugely complicated so that

i'm guessing that remote control market there in greater detail and
i think we should cloak this streamlined remote control device in a series of for it i root mean that's we use
allotment and the remote control we just a minute reduction us on it that they could
so what we're talking about is gene this concept everyone has a t. v. remote
you this is the innards of a remote control i mean
which i think it's quite interesting concept for that i see for remote control but it
control but it may be is doesn't quite go with the the fruit and veg
switch was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things to use a similar sort of thing including m. p. three players take your hi-fi remotes not just television these things i
them which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts

that it should be a simple mass-produced device because of the twelve and a half pounds cost but
this product which was a car cost of the competition devices similar
but still quite simple and quite cost effective so

and it's got these easily reachable buttons are quite nicely
a lot and it's something that we're like the company the next button

we can make these things out of wood titanium plastic or rubber special rubber is the
or my case it can be made of plastic rubber wood if you like or titanium
need and then hated group and a range these on the actual plastic or rubber hand held piece i've been it especially
and i definitely support but at the use of plastic and or rubber i mean titanium would
say plastic or rubber what's

the next part they want is the user interface concept sort of pushing
and i actually want a look and feel design user interface design you can
the look-and-feel design is for kate a staff
a staff gets the user interface design you get product

and i think if we're to me fashion our view of what we want to in a remote control should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset so
i'm we can also incorporate an l. c. d. display in the remote that
bottom instead of having the ipod style display screen on the actual remote switches five too expensive and when

and having a docking places a selling point to on and the new requirements
that if think the them pointing might be to choose one you know if
and as a little bit pointless as i think like point when
like point when you've got we've got the screen that it doesn't have to be anything fancy just a little
it's selling point

kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed and i
in arms can track look at it really professional terms here what's
i've been looking at the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate i've had some
looks a bit my so i think it might necessary do it look like a pineapple but
just but my method was to look at be my inspiration switch was
be next thing that they wanted us to do is look at chip on print as a decision
design you can look and see this as as like an marketing they want
that's i was looking on finnish one
