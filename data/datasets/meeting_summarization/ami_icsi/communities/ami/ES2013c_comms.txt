this is the beginning of the third meeting the conceptual design meeting
a rich and should be on the were hoping the meeting i have
the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared for tried at this point on
on and we should each have a presentation to make
and turn this error is that
i think we should cloak this streamlined remote control device in a series of for it i root mean that's we use
as it so if you just wanna sit there and shoo on the remote they could be like pear flavour
that this will increase the cost the electronics
and e. d. u. having be that the screen on the television screen i think it's a good idea "'cause"
it's selection will
out but it's actually the v. to indicate that is the volume so

carry on i right
just carry on
which are be keeping an eye on the clock forests "'kay"
but there are the decisions we have to turn to but we'll come back
but we'll come back to them in a minute after
at that point we that sarah would look at the current cost of competition what are the current ones sell for
as opposed to battery you have to either put a recharger or take replacing the batteries
one for should have been have cost information you in
it before but it sounds fantastic sounds

that goes back to ergonomic and
i've had some discussions with them at manufacturing division you have told
we could do a a double curved rapple one which would allow
we have very few buttons but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen like you know just a small on the bottom instead of
so all you really need as these four buttons with a enter in the middle
in fact
it seems that to you guys are quite keen on the plastic perhaps something
perhaps something reminiscent of the child's remote do you think we could

because it is much more organic
ease of use again pretty i mean
it's the top three but each of the fancy in technologically innovative are far more important so
i was thinking know that instead of having something like patterned you know so you know something similar to a summer grass that you have like fruit and veg is that we actually make these spongy they could be
which is fancy i think
we don't have something that push is a little buttons that
for c. news kind of a deal for me would be so you just have a fairly simple i mean not fancy but not too early minimalist i mean just it's pretty simple plastic probably i

functional is out and for
and for the fancy and that's exactly the german i'm thinking polished elegant you know kind of innovative but a cut above this is twice as
because actually this we could take up a lot of time allotment and
allotment and the remote control we just a minute reduction us on it that they could
lot of fun for the whole family everyone can have a round so what we're talking
do you think we could put it in a fruit colour and to have an abstract we could call it
just ran out ideas

in most families don't isn't the remote use a remote
but i think with this would allow is perhaps a personal family witness opinion about it we all
but i'm gonna come back to it on to the titanium and
and it can have a flat surface a curved surface or double curved surface but
probably i was thinking yellow and black just because that's
black just because that's the company's colours we have
and when you've got a screen saying there in front of you might as have a appearing on the screen in front of your it doesn't

'em we have forty minutes total it's
it's twenty five after two at the moment so who forty
and was gonna look at that ergonomics kate was gonna
or an a plus
this is exactly what the research has a sham so really
and then you get it works

your name i dunno what is the s. a. or a safer it a touch
this is really interesting change from past years because it is
on what again are the most important priorities in a decision making about it purchasing fancy
i have been influenced by pictures of ipods and also
do you wanna be next or you want it to go next
'cause otherwise we're putting up the price not only for putting those in the l. c. d. and the for the electronics as

i'm guessing that remote control market there in greater detail and
but then we had in the fact that they can each have their own individual fruit that's what's on
that's what's on the topics so this
but unfortunately from one it's that if we do that we have to have a pushbutton as the interface we
i think for instance all that by
if you do f. and f. eight again it's

be could call it the name
it would be a very simple product that would have a
perhaps that's on that particular suggestion need to go back to management and perhaps
one c. c.s all of buttons here little rubber buttons that
and she i think you all have been cell stimulating of working together
they want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use

casing my little mouse pointer right
buttons that goes through onto the appalled that i
so first role i wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source
which is kind of to meet when you have take
i have a think about the feature the features of each one is
what functions we actually need and then hated

so it's i'm glad to see the marketing
so really open this up to any other feedback this spongy fruit and veg
i think we can have some trouble when we get down to be component design on this spongy
buttons and it could have we company's new development of three sample sensor speaker so
which the choices that we discussed were pretty much battery can add a course or

i think many of us would assess it does with fancy something else we could do is
i mean you need a pen or something
but do my presentation in the aldrich it so
this is maybe getting a little bit complicated but it's it's
but we wouldn't have a specific volume up and they never have in the

that talk to the chip in carets the message
a little work all we have to
space type so something about like that or if buttons arrange dunno "'kay" in a circle up down left right
i was saying it and not actually scroll way to like a scroll but you know up
them which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts

we can either go for really cheap model people
c. d. screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons and it could
good any idea what you mention
is just what i understood would be don't ask for it harder
but a had a similar thing to this thing on the right to has

right this is the beginning
so who forty minutes is fine after three which are be
this is we're kate's expert case comes the end and
you in terms of work ability i think be a two front runners all the standard battery or the kinetic

go back
need a remote but the person who was really perhaps active in personalising i'm thinking a teenager the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get us off covers
as you just have to move it's and you'd be able to use it to
turn some watches and it's very handy you don't even

and this is a pushbutton one c. c.s
and i definitely support but at the use of plastic and or rubber i mean titanium would
for training keep it colourful and slightly organic and titanium's to futuristic
and this is why we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately

so we so i thought i showed you for my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available
but still quite simple and quite cost effective so
might take up your whole and we go
banana have it in yellow

and the function we was volume power numbers enter channels a way to move between channels easy to use and hand-held
it's hard on the streets yes
as the day you we used the t. v.

us and if they're add twenty to sixty years depending on branding some
so would say approach all and i think
in the initially i thought we could start with kind of fruit that would suits kind of a longer a hand held so banana a pineapple and pear

this is twice as important as the next finding which
which is really and found and get to hold and big easy buttons to press but still quite simple
i'm gonna but specific or maybe

special rubber is the closest a spongy
a spongy means that
i've been looking at the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate i've had some

else we could do is call it something that's fruit and veg or it could be could call it
my casing
but they scroll like a computer mikes so

that's kind of point classes also
management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product
we can have yet but standard double a. batteries in a replaceable a compartment

what would it be helpful if by describe the components a bit because
you can even have them in different flavours as it so
force or smelly scratch you

of this you're gonna be a little disappointed with some more things i have to tell you what i'm afraid
to tell you what i'm afraid this is the real one so
latex it's just it's smooth and hand-held and it's

we can have a half i see
more but it that's what you need if you want the l. c. d. display and
and so on that you can just much in the same way as an existing scary remote scroll on scroll up and down and

source where you actually get the energy by moving the device which is kind
i mean titanium would be great but
but i think it might be a bit too expensive and to can s. p. c. for training

probably won't work but you have to sort of threat thing and something a little work
be don't ask for it harder for all this part that's for the future fruit rise
and and it comes up with was showing on the channel the moment and you can

what is the interface look like
that if think the them pointing might be to choose one you know if
you know if we get on me is some these things are just are feasible maybe we could to send that any mean we call

which it means a flat plastic case and what we battery and simple push buttons or
that any mean we call it a blackberry
they're in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company so

so what i'd been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with the logo on it
you could see think we'd just in more detail i've got a c.
so i was thinking that out a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things are not and then

f. eight again
keep doing it and so you get involved you did they are
the picture the ipod what are the links to web production i couldn't copy

right to has scroll wheels without a display but
maybe we tested you something to show you thought
you were saying that they can then it would be useful as

the nicest like best style thing where you'd have up down left and right and so in the middle so you pick
so you pick your menu and then you different options and then
is have you seen these other about this is actually

be the dying because it looks like a timer pointing out but it's
and our decision making will be a little bit guided by taking this point be
i've used can and i can turn some watches and

right as we remember
first thing i want to address as one of the points that for this product which was

but for us for present the meeting
and then we could keep but titanium

reviewed and approved
sarah you percent of marketing research report

is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was
right so we're ready

the three presentations so we're going to
so we're going to pull the plug on me and

but everybody else especially since
but i'm trying to streamline mind a little bit

and but i think that with the current price were searching for within even on them our end of the of the market but i'm going
i'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so i will spend yes

so i'm guessing
any kind of a different options where you wanna change the settings where the you charge information about programs on the moment i don't think that's

detail and marianne theme for most work on was trendwatch
and this is all over the cat walks paris milan and i'm talking about clothing furniture she was this is really

in arms can track look at it really professional terms here what's
hot fruit and veg spongy and this is all over

i also we did a little research on
scratches no

fancy functional is
so and it that's it in their overriding your decision going now we're gonna watch this you can bring a year under or something like that are we gonna watch bus

important but maybe puts innovative is having a simple with we have technologically superior fabrics or you know design an interesting substances ease of use
i think possibly maybe more useful f. k. or the next

and the youngsters lot of fun for the whole
you have told me what's actually available what kind state of the offing components p.s and exciting new things like a lot but

or an a plus i think
f. and f. eight thirty so

actually some households do have three and four t. v.s and they would
so what's our place your here what would be the cost consequences of each of the three

we can make these things out of wood titanium plastic or rubber special rubber is the
or my case it can be made of plastic rubber wood if you like or titanium

that would add
i was really thing a lot about the i the imac kind of shall jen it's hard

the head but this is just to show you this is the innards
the porch so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use

and we that's the basic construction the we've got to accommodate we don't have something that push
a wind-up

i see a wind-up
it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work but

control but it may be is doesn't quite go with the the fruit and veg
no i think it's quite interesting is the kinetic energy source where

and we only have forty minutes
i'm from i don't have that information available

now i'm afraid this is the options we've got on or my case it can be
c. summons a bit pointless

what we can have scroll buttons and
and the scroll-button can incorporate the porch so you can

the electronics it's actually makes the device work with baseball three simple regular or advanced on the price
the ipod spinning wheel is really complicated it does

i i but i think they think it's quite important and we
and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen

but it could have an l. c. d. screen and
i'm any trends one menu any kind of a different options

manufacturing didn't actually give attach any price is too many things on print
are quite nicely space type so

i couldn't find the picture the ipod
another show you on the next half hour you

like you know you pressed and and it comes
there's a plastic so cheap and easy and moldable and of the else

i can try to this guy that i think that you see it
think that you see it on the one on the right state of the bottom is the most yes you're

circle which i think is a really good idea
but we can implement it was simple push buttons which is much cheaper

which is much cheaper
so i mean i do a channel up and down volume up and down next appear programmes up and and also that we get the different menus on the screen it's got things like settings and contrast up and down so all you really need

like top down left and right
also it's possible

i'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract of the design constraints or so
about this is actually the volume up and dying but

i think you will for all your presentations we have
we have about ten minutes left them

hiking carry

we have certain decisions to make "'em" we have forty

after i take us to be minutes of the previous meeting

as we remember i opened the meeting but for us for

the meeting the first meetings minutes reviewed and

which pretty much work for percent of the fifteen to thirty five year olds are has to be hand held power channel volume number keys possibly speech recognition

and then staff did the second presentation

that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys there were easy to use i think

i think almost with those things "'kay" percent of the working

'kay percent of the working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard

that it should be a simple mass-produced device because of the twelve and a half pounds cost but

but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and

and having a docking places a selling point to on and the new requirements

on and the new requirements that are for be for t. v. only and medically

and medically with that but so slogan and colour of the corporate design be included the corporate image

we that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than cents they were decision makers alternatively

alternatively would be a manufacturer to close with t. v. pen is josh

v. pen is josh me those parameters

kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed and i

and i was to type of these planets and work

and work on the final report

so we're ready to close that go back

go back to our that one

we're up to the point of d.

especially since case to be last so i'm

so i'm if i missed out your name i

respond to be a norris

this part or whatever you get out i

a norris

this product which was a car cost of the competition devices similar

devices similar to the ones that me showed us and

some of them i have a higher than recognition or in the more expensive and but i think

but i'm going to move on to more interesting more vibrant things

i know that you all are distance from cutting edge marketing research so

so in arms can track

and i think if we're to me fashion our view of what we want to in a remote control should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset so

the next finding which is technologically innovative this is interesting "'cause" i

this is interesting "'cause" i think the last meeting we were talking about technology has been so important but

pretty i mean it's the top three but

that's a good idea that

if it's like the covers that they use for the remote it's you tell yourself

they could be in the initially

it that they could be interchangeable they're spongy

they're spongy that goes back

so what we're talking about is gene this concept everyone has a t. v. remote

has a t. v. remote but then

about it we all need a remote but

v.s and they would have a remote for each one so

an i. d. and i'm nina

this spongy is gonna be difficult i'm afraid

and as for but just thing as if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components let's see if the market

or just have my ear to the market has this

let's see if the market

i was thinking titanium myself

i was thinking titanium i was

thinking titanium i was thinking it's just i have been

and also minimalist and sherry me

they are and they would fulfil the first priority which is fancy

are we talking about the device itself or that work for the device to be and interchangeable called cover as a separate product

product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable so

what's the delegate

what would that be a agreeable

a bit because i think it would give you maybe bring this discussion back to us of what we can actually physically do

and this isn't a very good in the head but this

you this is the innards of a remote control i mean

this is a remote that's been opened up on that's the

on that's the back of the interface

i push these buttons here

in carets the message that

that sends the message to the receiver

a one i wanna go through it not just addressing the and be the points you made several but

a wind-up i which i

which i think it's quite interesting concept for that i see for remote control but it

all we have to that solar power but

that solar power but i think we that's not so good in the dark

and then there's we've got just to use spongy there i it's rubber but

curved surface but i think if we wanna use standard components we're gonna have difficulty with anything much be on that

pushbutton that's the one where all familiar with what we can

where you can use it to go up and down change volume and channel something like that and

something like that and push two select like

you can have multiple scroll buttons this is

but it's it's in the technology is that i'm we can also incorporate

i'm we can also incorporate an l. c. d. display in the remote that

advanced on the price goes up speech is if this if we

this if we want a cheap one of the simple then we can then we have pushbuttons we have a fancy

we have a fancy interface designs got when i'm afraid

a little bit more for regular chip and you can have scroll buttons if

if you want the advanced chip you don't use it costs more but it that's

and the manufacture and if we shouldn't tell me that they have recently developed sample sensor sample speaker devices know i

and we might want to incorporate it somewhere

our real expertise is in pushbuttons i have to say but

to say but maybe you think that's old technology and

i think we've got two options we can either go for

really cheap model people what we costs down which it

or we can have something that looks a bit my so i

looks a bit my so i think it might necessary do it look like a pineapple but

what you mention that they would be a cost difference

do you have any idea if this can if the fancy model could be done in twelve euros fifty

because in i'm being quite serious may say that the things i mentioned are hard to that

i don't know how you important matters to keep exactly the colours of the real reaction company is just what i understood

which would allow say a banana but

as the interface we can't do anything fancy a

you getting you wars but now that one and then you get it works

this time if you come up or

i don't actually have a huge amount of different information little cakes that's just

just but my method was to look at be my inspiration switch was

switch was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things to use a similar sort of thing including m. p. three players take your hi-fi remotes not just television these things i

need and then hated group and a range these on the actual plastic or rubber hand held piece i've been it especially

i've been it especially interested in the ipod style scroll wheel which

i couldn't copy and paste that but

like i that makes this thing sky or cable one does like you know you pressed

do you can scroll on another show

half hour you scroll up and you see

scroll up and you see was on the other channels why are watching the same channel on the screen

but i lost legally taken with this chunky plastic katie remote

bottom instead of having the ipod style display screen on the actual remote switches five too expensive and when

of your it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching

i'd say we support that idea

it's difficult to make fancy shapes and this is why we can't

and as a little bit pointless as i think like point when

like point when you've got we've got the screen that it doesn't have to be anything fancy just a little

it's a duplication

fancy just a little menu showing i'm any

i don't think that's too taxing to thank you dear

that's right so we are being do you wanna go back to the picture of the kitty one

and it's got these easily reachable buttons are quite nicely

do you want scroll buttons are not as

but you know up i can try to

and then when you click on each one make you can go into any menu for that i'm gonna but

i think that's a clean design it's going to a strength

it's going to a strength which are in

which are in pushbutton technology

if it's in a cap on the screen i hear a

i hear a right

scroll but is hugely complicated so that

then they're terrible but they

but they all have this feature of this it's not quite a scroll wheel but it's again a selection and the circle which i think

i noticed that

almost impossible to misplace or lose might

we could call it like a fruit mean that would be

mean that would be the more abstract

we could actually do it in the rubber insert a plastic if you do that if you like the spongy

or call that are called a banana

it's a something else and it to bring see attention is have you

but they both save be on them which when

which when you first look at it you expect that to be the dying because

so we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these

and they never have in the scroll wheel then it's good to double up as all the other up and down functions

but then that's complicated

we need to come up with some specifics of the components the materials things like making the decision on the energy and that case and the interface type so

or solar they could have difficulty with it if it's a dark day the people dialling you in a way to do it as

i don't have figures on the difference in cost

what's the feeling for the group on the kinetic

handy you don't even know this that it's there

i've never come across it before but it sounds fantastic
