very but this remote control has many functions
wants and the basic or make this week simple function but remote control

it's on the other things i found this a complicated remote controls
the thing is we might be older handle the simplicity of remote control and kind of put it more complicated things into a voice control so

anything else is just gonna be a television remote
and too much middle can remotes behave unexpectedly by receiving full signals
and is also possible to the remote catch on fire and enjoying
v. remote and see what it is that they're using and then this other question
did difficult see what would be in i think like it you can you speak in the remote that you're trying to find "'kay" you have some
i'll go to the back of the remote and have

remote control works as follows it's
and usually the way a remote control works as it stands infrared bits to another system user

i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i just got from the border how we're supposed to do with this remote control and
i think we're gonna have to understand how of remote controls were colours to successfully complete this project
intelligent and all know what a normal remote control does
remote controls way that we can't quite seem i read they're very but
another remote control slightly different it's a
about what they like in what they tell about their general t. v. remote control practices
we just are model of of the remote control
women it occurs to me that if we have a touchscreen people are gonna have to recharge a remote controls
i can't see anybody buying a lot a remote control that we have to plug in so

button which is i an infra-red signal to the remote control
life to it if the remote did you have to press a button for the remote turn on italian who want
italian who want to turn on a remote control to fit

it's going on the other functions happen for some people they're important
for some people they're important but the primary
people are gonna want their remotes that could happen to see if flashing think it's i just

here and i found that too much metal no design you could potentially interference of people use the remote send commands and too
were we were actually serve like watching a hundred people use t. v. remote and see
and does find out that have fifty percent more people they're the worst thing about a remote is how often it was it or we can find in a room so i
that's the design people but it is

manatee function f. eight that
function f. eight that looks like it's gonna come up
a function f. eight hold on
but it really is the primary functions and get it to look which are

we can see sacrificed more function for a better television remote anyway so
complicated the most users will find it to find that they will use most of the functions because i don't know
so at a. and the functionality of a complicated device but use a
the majority the time at all it's going on the other functions
sarah she's recommended that we go for a simple or functions so if you were functions
easier given there we go for simpler function and
simpler function and we're only going for telling
it seems like you know "'kay" bill hand all those functions was just one microchip like
and a small picking function even

follows it's a pretty basic you guys
like a lot of these laptops another want to use it pretty you can do
there's also us are ready about what they like to a remote i'm pretty much they
remote i'm pretty much they all think there's a t. s. and not very useful and it the
we've got you know so designers it's just a row pretty much in fact they suggested that we need to go with plastic

at which will see sometimes people pick up really
people pick up really a signals know like and

that's a page one of my presentation so if he
i don't know if that's the radio look into technically that's the design
technical thing but i like that the voice recognition for the paging system
picking function even if you can do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button which is

and it the younger demographics are really interested in voice recognition options i
i think it be possible to combined d. locator device and the voice recognition technology
menu options i mean how all these other complicated voice recognition settings things that you know can use every
i think this voice recognition thing is that we've got a market for it a lot of
let's see with this voice recognition option as and just for the simple functions the the on off channels volume

that we have to maybe sacrifice the faceplates for touch screen
with a touch screen for the basic functions
but it's provision let's go for a touch screen with several submenus for possible extra that one
put the channel on the on off switch on the touch screen
so let's go with a a touch screen
was just gonna be a one touch screen for everybody
i think we should pick up with a park in red interface on the touch screen and
