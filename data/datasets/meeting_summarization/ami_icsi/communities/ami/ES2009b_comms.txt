i'm just gonna go over real quickly some news i just got from the border how we're supposed to do with this remote control and
and then we'll have a bit of discussion
i've just have an important
just have an important to at the same as but it needs to be television
but it needs to be television only seven that we're doing
it also needs to have be company colours included in it and so
that's red and black and has have the slogan is just to get the slogan it's we put fashion in electronics
no teletext i'm not
i'm not teletext is but
teletext is but i'm not assuming you guys do so we
you guys do so we don't wanna include that in this particular design
so given those
given those guidelines which will have some affect on how we design will discuss
we can see sacrificed
we can see sacrificed more function for a better television remote anyway so
anyway so i drove
right that's a page
follows it's a pretty basic you guys
sends a message to other system so
people pick up really a signals know like and
eco friendly so i thought maybe we could do something with solar power within our client battery back up
the centre i'm thinking infra-red "'cause" it is the industry
it is the industry standard multi channel
fair enough
but in this case so many t. v.s
personal preferences i
i really think that we sheet plastic as a person at all
so maybe do you have some kind of a static value
like in the white
like a lot of these laptops another want to use it pretty you can do
you can do is some kind of colour better quality plastic that we can work with
that should be a problem
for example that possibly have a laptop there's something that's quite possible for us to do
it's in my presentation
if the next we can have the user interface developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as
a function f. eight hold on
support them all
so fear the requirements we need here at
we need here at between need a pretty electronic device it
so my findings
quite intelligent and
intelligent and all know what a normal remote control does
remote controls way that we can't quite seem i read they're very but
look at
very but this remote control has many functions
a lot of things but it it's quite complicated the most
how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do
as you also is quite a boring design
different it's a simple remote control many less buttons but as many fewer functions
much easier for the user to manipulate and use
else that's a bit of a cheap working and it's also
and it's also quite boring
revolutionised to the idea of a remote control so
so at a. and the functionality of a complicated device but use a
device but use a simple format of display a fairly is it to work with those can
with those can add another slide here but i
slide here but i didn't play
that would be perfect
that would be perfect think
and then this other question about what they like in what
about what they like in what they tell about their general t. v. remote control practices
pretty much through testing we're finding out that most the time i ever resist using changing the channel turning around it using the volume
for some people they're important but the primary
so i think what we're trying now with a page or something when we come in the play with a lot of these people
that's the design people but it is
people but it is something worth thinking about especially since
about especially since the younger demographics that was the one that's gonna keep growing so if
so if that's the direction were have them at some don't think about
but it really is the primary functions and get it to look which are
so it's a good start for us
that's great thank you sir right
i just switch it back finish up
we've got you know so designers it's just a row pretty much in fact they suggested that we need to go with plastic
sarah she's recommended that we go for a simple or functions so if you were functions
do we need to decide who we selling this to use the years
use the years that suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted thought about voice control
or do we want to go for all the demographic of my thought is
so maybe this we should look into this younger demographic
easier given there we go for simpler function and
simpler function and we're only going for telling
how this voice operation thing i think is a good idea assuming that it's doable at least for the basic controls maybe we can balance
maybe we can balance it that way you know we can see
you can't say record alias tonight at seven p. m. but we might be able to say
but we might be able to say volume up
that could work
that could work i like that
therefore be found
i think that's a double
if it's hidden under the couch very this we
i dunno a bit technical thing but
technical thing but i like that the voice recognition for the paging system
new all time record the younger make it could use kind of like voice control method
method we all the market might exactly how may considered
if we and you just touch pad screen thing and we still do we know if that's an option technically right now do that
have a look at and you are costs of a touchscreen methods and whatnot they seem to be
they seem to be a you know almost as cheap as a button that's fine
interesting option especially because then you could have like your prime a screen just be easy now for five basic functions you know have
day and that a lot of people are can use but it is an option
no wonder there for adding so much technology so this one in there are also gonna be able to me there for power twelve fifty euro you know goal for selling these things it seems
like a cheap this point most expensive part of the whole mechanism so it's
i we'll cross that
be and that's perfectly viable question
i'm saying that we're gonna just focus on those younger africa for a minute then but then
wants and the basic or make this week simple function but remote control
i think this voice recognition thing is that we've got a market for it a lot of
bit more less be calling the market on as we not have many
we don't have many people there
people there are these are very many competitors are out there to do that so called
to do that so called
right because we've got we've touched
because we've got we've touched on most of this the idea that peaking function a touchscreen faceplates
i think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that kind of has a portion of the device is not interchangeable where is the surrounding questions are interchangeable we could have the casing
it's the casing
a smell for say we're including
we haven't and you tests on face plates were there
of emblematic whereas you just sit at home some some becomes or
hopefully some people have people coming over goal to hang out a half the most
a separate later but
but we will have to evaluate what's most important i think
on this is a any other questions comments that came up in these presentations

so you can use metal i was thinking
standard multi channel so
when the t. v. or into the pensioners of the world i don't think so
control so it could be sold to both the younger market new all time record
go ahead
it's definitely an option tech we have a look at and you

components just some ideas that i had energy
out a half the most people have their televisions the morning or
we can discuss that one and further when we think about whether the one we do costs and so forth
true plastic is there a cheap enough for making a whole thing plastic anyway
based on which you on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or apple plastic case is

is me but i was looking through
could have the casing be in the face plates
it's a like a cell phones like we have you know nokia model accent intend people make a face plates for it we just

is you recommend it if it's a great idea
it if it's a great idea with
with a touch screen for the basic functions

how we design will discuss that later i mean "'cause"
right we don't have many

that later i mean "'cause" it's television we will be able to you
will be able to you change our

so do i am clock display here
so my findings

that's a page one of my presentation so if he
findings which to for their study here and i

user interface controls the chip that's
that's the casing and the buttons and accordingly them as just as

and enjoying the customer i just think those lawsuits
i just think those lawsuits that be really bad there for a stress

there for a stress primarily plastic construction
energy source it's kind of hits the

hours so you can use metal
here we have a my technical functions design presentation

power and c. s. c. compatible and that
and that poll a slider for a range of

and possibly operate several different kinds of races although we now
although we now a find that that's no problem

that would be any number of different things such a switch on the television have to select channel that sort of thing i think are quite
another remote control slightly different it's a

to get back to
make it just an option

and then you can start to beep and
'kay you have some in it picks that

something very basic
the thing is we might be older handle the simplicity of remote control and kind of put it more complicated things into a voice control so

a little sticky pad to stick on top of your television and you just say something
or an isolated magnet or something like that you

say we're including three four faceplates can try the cost up and the other
and the other questions if we don't put them are really in a position to evaluate that market we haven't and you tests

control and the lower turnover do you guys to make representations on what you found and then we'll have

seven that we're doing d. v. d. we're not doing

anything else is just gonna be a television remote

for reasons that i don't really know there's

but it's the board so there you go so

i drove or "'cause" industrial designer it's go ahead make a presentation

manatee function f. eight that

function f. eight that looks like it's gonna come up

very features powerpoint

features powerpoint is lovely

i think we're gonna have to understand how of remote controls were colours to successfully complete this project

remote control works as follows it's

there's the energy source involve not like a battery or solar power something along those lines is an integrated circuit

is an integrated circuit which the microchip

which the microchip and that actually

and that actually composes the messages and

and usually the way a remote control works as it stands infrared bits to another system user

here and i found that too much metal no design you could potentially interference of people use the remote send commands and too

and too much middle can remotes behave unexpectedly by receiving full signals

at which will see sometimes people pick up really

and is also possible to the remote catch on fire and enjoying

it's kind of hits the eco friendly so

user interface hours

i was thinking maybe a high grade it's like a plastic the chip

the chip it's like a base chip by releasing a way around that we can

around that we can really be different in that respect

so we're aiming at put

we're aiming at put in it means power

of and the receiver of course a number of electronic devices but in

at all the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits we should

of lawsuits we should in the list gonna cut the cost of this or aesthetic "'cause" you were thinking

is it is a way that we can use modern types of polymers in my mind types of plastic so maybe

i computer adjusting

computer adjusting

electronic device it needs to be universal

i can get tickets use for

my findings wanna send messages that to the television set

it's on the other things i found this a complicated remote controls

complicated the most users will find it to find that they will use most of the functions because i don't know

so my personal preferences revolutionised

this incorporating some the ideas that we had previously like are having multiple it's quite it's

to get back to you

it's fine so

i was looking through some marketing report so we've got we

so we've got we have a usability test were we

were we were actually serve like watching a hundred people use t. v. remote and see

v. remote and see what it is that they're using and then this other question

the majority the time at all it's going on the other functions

it's going on the other functions happen for some people they're important

but the primary uses are really basic

and so big complicate the remote like once on the last presentation are really know it's the general public's use they're

use they're not using a lot of it they don't need

of it they don't need it to be even find it frustrating

be even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that was to do with

and does find out that have fifty percent more people they're the worst thing about a remote is how often it was it or we can find in a room so i

there's also us are ready about what they like to a remote i'm pretty much they

remote i'm pretty much they all think there's a t. s. and not very useful and it the

and it the younger demographics are really interested in voice recognition options i

i don't know if that's the radio look into technically that's the design

standards so

finish up it's a bit of discussion plan on to the next phase

so i think we've covered most of these important questions through this do you guys presentations we've

of my thought is we've got we've we're gonna go for sleek

we've we're gonna go for sleek work i mean we are putting the fashion in electronics

we need to wonder how about how we can make it better and smaller and faster you

you were constrain the plastic very

we've got this idea are on the same we need to think about revolutionising the way it's a looking which might be

i think it be possible to combined d. locator device and the voice recognition technology

with a simple can am i can locate and

is that only gonna be within or two wanted to arrange them

did difficult see what would be in i think like it you can you speak in the remote that you're trying to find "'kay" you have some

voice from far away

it's good point

very this we think you know it's a little chip or whatever that has to be a button maybe i can be voice activated to

or something like that you know some of the wouldn't interfere i dunno a bit

exactly how may considered all the right could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and one

i miss something about the screen go ahead

'cause it seems like an interesting option especially

menu options i mean how all these other complicated voice recognition settings things that you know can use every

that you know can use every day and that

but it is an option there for this high-tech market that sort of been is this meeting we're going for

it seems like you know "'kay" bill hand all those functions was just one microchip like

so it's just something to consider

i we'll cross that bridge you know it said earlier stages of development be

but then in the sense that it's bells and whistles are available for anybody wants and the

it a lot of too many bit more less be calling

we not have many

that was my microphone right

that we have to maybe sacrifice the faceplates for touch screen

i'm not that's a really correct i think if you kind of

back to the the costs the material we have to ask

we have to ask whether want to include a certain number faceplates with the package a

after of i have a sense kind of like a gimmick but what i'm really go anywhere

we just are model of of the remote control

on the publicity the phase further phone is you have it out in a round it is sort

out in a round it is sort of emblematic whereas

some some becomes or to watch t. v.

i think we've had the discussion already on this is a any other

have we confirm that we're gonna go ahead with a a touchscreen

i think they'll be best let's

best let's based on which

case is that the this easy on the cost have a look

on the cost have a look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic is you recommend
