an l. c. is you see when you use the scroll buttons
but that's the only scroll the button on it then
but no we use one scroll button and the other one this year one till
with the scroll button and
the scroll button and this one has to be and
one way to scroll buttons and one with without
on the left scroll button on the right the scroll button
and young peoples i think scroll buttons good

the left or right up down arrows to to the volume and channel and a menu button
and a menu button to non manipulate the l. c. d. or display
we don't have buttons for the menu or m. f. to use
that the menu button is
but if you put push the menu button

it's not a lot of reading buttons
whatever buttons can be blue
and maybe each set of buttons as on colour so it's good
with the manual button and then you also
yes but you don't know which of the it's called buttons you have to choose
but now the first the buttons
with the switch button
then this is the design and the buttons

when you want to go more move up you just scroll up and click on a button
button and then you also can stop scrolling it's just not like
and the buttons are in the next page so depends on the

and maybe it's also them false all if we you eight euros that's different kind of shapes for the for remote control that we don't
i think we must discuss so what will be better if we have a better shape of the remote control or bad options on it with
with the scroll menu scroll thing and l. c. d. and then a flat remote control or and more
or and more and shaped remote control with scroll without l. c. d.
no i mean the shape of the remote control is

so good good icons on the buttons and and big buttons is my personal opinion
personally i think two scroll buttons r. and easy to handle

our group we want to so our remote control so and then
maybe it's to get a remote control not like all the other one straight and flat and long but to
and then i'll have to discuss about the costs of all of things for a remote control the battery there
then the form of the remote control i think it's also a to have it curved
but then we'll get to the regular remote controls and i think what
this is the remote control and then have something
because from ohio but remote controls nine i have it
or a remote control more like a joystick

you have to was using the mute button and
the mute button and the two to have to numbers

and what's interesting is the icons on the buttons some buttons
some buttons have icons like to play stop but we don't

and but then we have just the basic remote control and
not two basic not a basic remote control who everybody already has

and then it depends on the colours it's
chip depends on the l. c. d.
depends on the scroll
so it depends on the l. c. d. in a scroll
so shapes of the design depends on the l. c. d. and

the shapes are curved crown mike
but to give him a shape of your hand so you it's easy to use something like that but that's just an
and maybe like it's hand shape and so
and so you paid here in your hand in here are the buttons
i would your left hand you can push the button so
shapes or what do we need
we have to say get the idea of and more like in shape of your hand
or no scroll things just a shape
and the the hand shape is also rubber

maybe it's easy to use for the channels when
and also for the mouse for the volume it's also now easy to use the scroll-wheel up
and that's also easy to just a menu of a thing like this and you get it here can do with
but then it's not easy to use scroll we'll
to sell it's easy to get like this which is like
it in the menu that's not easy
bit bigger with easy
if you have this taught in l. c. d. is not easy

i think the younger people will have your televisions which can provide our remote control

we have one new thing discovered it's a scroll
the scroll-wheel up a scroll but and that's also easy
the scrolling you can do it with your thumb
tie in it with the scroll
maybe it's better if the scroll wheels are more separated
