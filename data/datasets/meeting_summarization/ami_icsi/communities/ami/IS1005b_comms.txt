i think we should stick and they use for functions because we want less buttons so
buttons was that then we want less buttons know maybe with a l.
maybe with a l. c. d. we can do something with less buttons but

and from this we came up with a few that's the channel buttons the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control
to them you know which buttons i thought were the most important buttons on the remote control and
and then thirdly they have some is commented on the fact that the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control bad and course repetitive strain injury

we put them in an in our usability lab or a tree and got them to you know and play with remote controls and also
controls and also to complete after that done that to complete a questionnaire and to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls
so that's his is what first race and the most of that cat remote controls and
and what happened with a red you'll waves when they're both have the same have our remote control for example and
a specific remote control that it is it
it's the same thing is so you suggest that is that we should it's use the remote control only for t. v. but for d. v. d. and also devices because it make its
the ones i mean this remote control a developing is a generic control for all t. v.s i think
i think it would be better just to stick to the remote control and not to bother to t. v. to trendy things but it
in the in menus of the n. c. d. all the back of as a remote control

hear but they're not under control

t. v. that the layout of the remote controls they don't match the way they used it and
we also lasts uses it that's a specific features that they'd like to see in that on the remote control in particular
and secondly these i think speech recognition i. is a useful feature to have on our remote control
and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into a remote control that's what it
you know had some features on the control to display it i'm more to display

was that the trend was i was use it as use is you can order no but how they were less likely to want a sort of each is in a in a remote control so i
lunch when you got something on t. v. and putting a less the and and the remote control

one starting to when you start to communicate with the r. t. v. then it's like and you can protocol with your remote so you've
than than a t. v. manager remote

to have a clue the button that was use that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button
all the all the other buttons such as to audio and pictures selection configuration buttons and things where you just you know what a park or less than a could do one times per hour we
so the available things l. c. d. the buttons and everything or
of the t. v. because it's button we don't use very from that it's when you need anyway so
we could have for example two buttons like simple moulded and then small it i
i mean about buttons it a three
button should we make it the button or some something which would be
it's an button on the phone
juan big button old-fashioned

the we should just design the remote control and you surely don't have any access to the t. v. design or we can change some design because

not on the control but on the screen
not under control on the screen and t. v. screen and then

this i was thinking do we need the power button that all should
i think when as a power button they mean to turn the t. v. on and off
i'm a based on a usability studies again the people said that the power button was it very relevant button you
just to the decision on the power button should we
power button

so we keep all these buttons
so we could what we could probably do is to keep also to keep keep the l. c. d. and all the buttons and we could make it

so the major things with it and that was that you just don't like the look-and-feel of most remote controls at the county on the market

but i'm not about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition these
by the buttons good for me as a designer the circuit about the speech

i mean there's always we can always have these less often used functions hidden some way and
but that's not a very core and it's useful function
not used very often
