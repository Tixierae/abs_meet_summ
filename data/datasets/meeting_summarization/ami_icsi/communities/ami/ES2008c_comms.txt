like a large button that
like a large button that sort of thing

buttons for buttons we have
buttons which are exactly like what they're describing so that might be something
we don't want lots of buttons complicated features we want something
a it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around the buttons are
the buttons could be fishy to
but then the buttons have to be very small but you think
that's your all purpose select a button right there
so few buttons remain things but then i go back
i assume that's what else we're gonna like at the like the additional buttons we can use

and see you use the buttons just a scroll around and find the more advanced features you want something
and if we have a skin on screen kind of thing you could scroll through like you can use your buttons to scroll through things i think that

the buttons are the different shapes and you
maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits

on the t. v. "'cause" if you're changing the brightness on trying to see it happening kind of and
you really need buttons changing the channel
i need some kind of i dunno sort of up down kind of button but the volume

i mean i know the ipods and things right now have touch scroll buttons which are exactly
is that the button on an ipod is it what is it
push or scroll right
simply it's cheaper to make pushbuttons and it is a scroll button so in terms of

for buttons we have push buttons which is
push buttons which is what real reaction uses the most often but we also
which can have integrated push buttons or we could go all
so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery or
probably push buttons but i'm it intrigued
are was keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for all the features that you use most of them
and i think if we wanna keep a cost we should just go for push buttons "'cause" then
so in terms of economics it's probably better to push buttons

and the button to switch off in case you get bored

if you're watching t. v. in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons which are not

no idea
this is it's an interesting idea and
so i like like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often so you'd needs
channel i mean that's also a good idea it's you can
an idea possibly my email and
it you have any ideas had it possibly use these and how to use a fruit or vegetable or or the spongy material at all think
i the idea of a we all like five "'cause"
for but you know like just the idea of like thoughts so few

box is where you press buttons and it comes up with the
be harder press a button
when you when user remotes you press the buttons where you're from you
so you hold it in one and when you press
one and when you press the buttons are fun
what i'm pressing buttons are my ipod that i do it all day and press
hand and you press the buttons are fun and
and you press the centre button that's your all

we wanted to be simple and
we want something that looks and simple
if we're gonna have pushbuttons the require a simple chip but
'cause then we can have a simple chip and
on a chip let's go with the simple chip

so instead of opening a box you just kind of peeler in the remote
kind of peeler in the remote control so

space each remote
we want people to be able to use it as a remote control so we need
if it was all l. c. d. on that on the remote i don't know that you could from the you'd be able to see a
preference but that really over the next year it that's gonna be switching to a fancy look-and-feel remotes that just
to make is like could make a spongy remote would

just adjusting the marketing kind of and
how what kind of model
want something that's a good kind of model over we could have
it also have to have a kind of back light in it "'cause" it to be
but i think you do need to have some kind of function where it's you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description of like i know i
but there's all kinds of or as a nation that would do
t. v. i kind of them wanting to say on the t. v. "'cause"
but in that side is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things are just
i would be more with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing
