as the previous meeting i will be the six or three and
so we need to have caught some corporation these some research things to do with a speech recognition and on just recognition or
because for the intelligent contra you said that we can use the voice recognition are they just recognition that's
button but that way if you look at not funny all can i just i just speak something that yes why is true
take a set gesture of a power
but you have a remote control so maybe
because i suppose we need to do research to have something working
some efficient
look at areas where small so
this could be downloaded by the way the menu
but we're here it's not an object but here you say
but you can lose
but you would still have the buttons or
maybe tried to makes the go controller and the fancy control i mean
just want to have something comes along which is an a kind of intelligent control easy to use sophisticated and fancy
that the functional t. v. you can retrieve
no it's not the only the probably only the user of compromise that is also the use of the t. v.
buy the product and so on
maybe would be able to take a decision after that's so
so these so these are used to describe to use what
maybe you record it somewhere else
wood and it's an interesting
depends but i think that or whatever will be in it as an intermediate
and so i think maybe something very little would be enough

so as the previous
so the last the concept do you think i didn't we want to
i think sometime it's very coming is to use voice interface and just interface then use button but
this but this would never happen anyway
because it was for a number for sale

i will first
technical
technical as the sun interface
the first line so we'll come from
so there are three concepts you know a compartment

it's very many i
because then you need
but you know the periphery
if it if we if they you when you sell this car for you try that is can check that handy if it's true if you
so it can be some know classic pushbutton like this one or you have

i think i will let's our user interface designer speak first is to take heed jordan
wall
i think that's quite it's quite attractive
control or a plastic remote control like this one so and

do you say you have the user interface would be very cute very
attract even fast as
so you can build a kind of black box and put it on t. v.
and that's the point

but suppose you got a cold you have a mute remote control
if you see the pushbutton control it you can send these can use remote control ever and the were the same one if you have the language
i'm it's the user pay the same price he's happy to have recognition but
used

but how is high risk easy to trust like speak recognition all just a recognition
you know you're not obliged to share it
that's the other one teed off and kind income for a d. v.
if you say one he saves time

i think that you know switching from one country cut corners it'd be a problem so they
you that the file that's not the function of the controller that the functional
we cannot rely my hand or percent on these features to you to use the comp are but it's the
so i if we can have a remote control that is really basic simple then works fine it's already know

'cause for example
no we don't we cannot
never mind
are inside of those looks something

so we're but keep the cost some of the impression that's all control is very attractive
control we need something that's easy international suppose
are but it's the features of our corporate site as you have the feature of voice recognition mean you know mobile but you still don't use it to be a mother out but you we used

we can t. v. like that all come from a lot of products so
it was in fact to design used to show use the design of what the inside at what the inside and out as a different component of sir
and maybe can attract will be a call to call it customers and that's

is easy vote to remember it i reckon i did
not too expensive to
saw the last point is you were so we do want to have some very cheap integrated sort of circuits chips or do we have to lower level or very expensive depends but i think

they can now speak as the same time
works fine so i if
are so it's the remote and it

the programme so this a channel four channel three channel for some of the all the size is
three so we've come to a channel three i don't have to do
no but this is design and disadvantage

yes control
if you offend you or
know if you have something that works

and i do you do get gesture
but you can lose it
and put it on t. v. and just to recognise gestures and voice

go you use a way we would like to have a go to like control
let's go to the industrial designer maybe would
that's right i think in line

it seems that we have a problem with the
if you remember what you're saying
and i saw the last point

so let's start our
and what that what about the materials

so let's start our second meeting conceptual design so
but that doesn't doesn't not in a small t. v. simple them to read please they're all comparable we've anyway if there's no key features and then you come from that's the thing

so first i will present
but suppose you have a family watching t. v. and if we want to use their private remote control in the same time do you think it will work everybody wanting to change channels in the same time

the second be the fancy come from the last line to
the last line to hide income for so there are three concepts

next every o. explained my mail and the
where you know as a boat and that is the buttons are a light at the end of the night or you know you can

that's as team expert told us most of the people want to use the remote control to zap between channels you think that will be able
which are be control is you'd prefer

you think that will be able to use gesture is because
i did you get what's that called earlier then you'd

or if you say channel three two three four six light i think they will be born after a while you don't think so
if you if you alright if you are you have a product is works matter percent reliable we do replace it with another man

we just are used on
but the product is not this you know

if you have the language you have to be harder for each time
if you have something that works fine and he's really a fancy looks and it's easy to use

sense to be quite
we'd be a battery like as a classic about or so and

and what about for voice recognition do we have microphones and where will be they
i think it would be they're not to tune into the channel control and just

i think there's no way of war because
but where's the controller

and you just the matter for eighteen bad eating comparable
but here you say you want to use just technology

it's in a if you lose it
i mean it for example the go you use a

the buttons or is it do
is it do you think it should be only voice recognition then just recognition wall

the channel control and just a would be controller fancy controller
that looks features of our control with a then

that we can add for a lot of some function like for browsing can go into that so or something like that but i think the
as a remote control so

i don't see how i doing speech or just to recognition would make the remote control look more like go
could it easy to use simple works fine

in fact that i don't know
them so for example

and we will have three presentations and

and we'll have to decide on the remote control concepts and

and find maybe we will close the position so

first i will present the concept of user interface

there's three concepts and the user interface the first line

my mail and the first is the logo control

so i want the comparable

so i want the comparable to be easy to use that to be said fifty functions so it's a combination

so it's a combination of easy to use and the fifty functions

this is the first concept of a control the second

the second concept is a fancy control so we're

fast as these there's several examples t. v. "'s"

that one or three c. i. it's

why not how big is

how big is good so i suppose after that so

we want to we want power control to be smart so maybe you

technology such as speech recognition technology and just recognition technology so we

we've is a lost the features i think we can attract a lot of user

no this is the three concept of a rubber stopper

i just have one question because for

is because if they do all the time the same gesture as you said previously in the last meeting maybe you will get injuries because that's or if you

of a power

of all in the immediate what can be very speech recognition is more reliable under false the immediate vocabulary just recognition is also worry

if you have one brother and one sister and they want to

and they want to watch or their favourite sent to the programme so

it's but is that can happen

but is that can happen even really know is kind of remote control with

control with that

remote control so maybe you can keep it for would be you know you're not obliged

you mean it could be a problem for this guy

income for a d. v. you if you have the control i can save ten three so we've

i think it's a disadvantage

i mean maybe can have a switching more apart from you know voice control or two

that's one other question how

many other controls are

how much would cost

no more expensive maybe

right so if we use the basic

no we just have some call three series some research and c. d. we don't

and c. d. we don't have to do some basic research on this field

you think it will cost and not for us

because that this technology is the for the immediate were really need to the mexican recognition is very

that is changing how the remote control is gonna be bit because then you

i mean this doesn't have the port to do recognition for example

you have also the language problem with and

you have all the of all because the localities that

i agree let's not

where small so that's not a problem

but there's one problem that's a bad about that talked about us is the international

international suppose we're want to sell it and false

be recognition system will be able to instead of french if you want

if you want to go to aim but it will be able to understand english so

the key i think it a lot of the key feature a file control and that he's it has some but that keychain

it's true if you sell this comparably friends you can recognise strange

it's the list but it's if it's not gonna do this

and with no increase in the private production price of the remote control

you got the this product it is technology has already been developed so

and that slide we have to do that we do adaptation

in the flesh country you have to do on it because it

you have all use a value of all different family we have to do that but we have to do adaptation to

no not too complex

we have to take care of the twelve euros

do you think if we have far from television that will work

of war because you don't have to wear a microphone and

you can you get e. d. and microphone here

a microphone array

but what is the use of voice or just recognition if you have a remote control that like have an object if you

if you want to use voice suggest you need to be free without any objects you just want to interacts

to talk to the t. v.

you just want to interacts with the television

you use the outcome and i do you

so but find out if it is somewhere in the room if you may be feeding in the table is there you go to say it's triangle one and this is the remote control it gives order to the t. v. c. for

but so you need to come out and you know a microphone sitting there is a remote control

recognition wall you still have the possibility to use buttons

i think it we should keep the flexibility to the user and

user and everything you know

it's you can see it as speech from my mother to another

it's big mystery risky

if you do then we did that mission or something or

we should have a copy this new technology

which kind of controller would you prefer to use you as a remote control user

i think he need to know controller that is very reliable and so

i think it's possible

but even if you speak to

stick to the first part so what's the difference between our comparable with other products in the market that looks

with a then it necessary to design you comparable or without any breaks are in features

would you agree if you all controller read that cover only a single function if you do not have some function i did that

but i think the user need

t. v. you can retrieve that t. v. we then you t. v. be seen that probably function but

but you need new remote control and then because if you wanna browse internet or i don't know if you wanna type something or

events and then from there

that's up to the prom i can see uses the voice of the gesture so what can happen if i mean you for example if we

but you we used to send you mobile out of you choose the line b. "'s" was recognition that's the

that's the features not flat or percent reliable but

reliable but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products

but we want something of that words "'cause" all the time every day every how more for everyone

i thought that was it as a family guy

do need to me

but there's no big difference between that and it's a comparable

i mean the user is not only interested in having speech or just recognition know

that's the problem in them

i mean i know it's more interesting to develop a remote control always speech and gesturing whatever but you have to think

but you have to think the user uses the one who gonna buy the product and

can you go to the next one but it's not

it's not that those are so it's the remote

component do that so these

i think there's something wrong with the year

interface concept

very good record it down to do and

and then say that so without

and maybe we can first come to

i think would be more interesting to start with that

is from i mean you can't keep a real slice the president

i think it's more interesting way of saying

the president maybe there

you will have some more information and i think

i think be interesting after you some tuition to have on that bus presentation

in fact that i don't know i use that

i use that in my presentation i don't have to for

so it would be interesting so i could show you some picture of what the inside and

looks something i want to discuss ease which kind of much i'm going to use so

we you we'd be a wooden wouldn't be wooden remote control or

in which can be easier the different but i'm so it can

or you have what's some button like a c. d. where you know

or you know you can see that in the darkness and

as the other thing i want to discuss it so easy which kind of an impression a piece and in addition we want to have so really

so really be for example that are so are our energy argumentation we'd

so and i think that for example for that in addition it would be good to have

so for example in some country where you live in the countryside you are far from the c. d.s for example in some place and instantly are so if you have it at least if you have solar a limitation you just when you want to have a recharger or a remote control or you just put it on the side and after one or you can come

or you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of them and it can be something interesting to make people buy i don't know

i think it's an added value to the remote control and maybe

and that's that we price of adding these solar battery would it be something really that will increase the price of prediction more

fact having them by of we if we want to have

if we want to have a battery a regular battery and the sun our initial battery it could be you can add it in because the price but it to

but it to be an added value it so that would be compensated

so that would be compensated so

and personal

maybe if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something we would

even if we did not want that you would but just a part of the you know maybe wood and in wood and it's

so it'd be interesting

want something easy to use and so i

i think it should fit on the price you want out of four euros

and what about the buttons

i think the buttons i prefer you know as a as c. d. collected buttons because
