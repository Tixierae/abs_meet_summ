but you have a remote control so maybe
if you see the pushbutton control it you can send these can use remote control ever and the were the same one if you have the language
as a remote control so
i think it's an added value to the remote control and maybe
that it should be image on the t. v. and not on the remote controller so
with them but you mean the remote control with them you do what you if you want you can just use

and we'll have to decide on the remote control concepts and
but is that can happen even really know is kind of remote control with
remote control so maybe you can keep it for would be you know you're not obliged
control or a plastic remote control like this one so and

that looks features of our control with a then
i don't see how i doing speech or just to recognition would make the remote control look more like go
that where the three first points from the remote control and then use no if we look

the channel control and just a would be controller fancy controller
maybe tried to makes the go controller and the fancy control i mean
so maybe we're just focus on the go control or less the fancy control maybe try to mix

the remote control has to be technologically innovative it's three then

i mean i know it's more interesting to develop a remote control always speech and gesturing whatever but you have to think

so we're but keep the cost some of the impression that's all control is very attractive
we want to we want power control to be smart so maybe you
many other controls are
control we need something that's easy international suppose
which are be control is you'd prefer
which kind of controller would you prefer to use you as a remote control user
i think he need to know controller that is very reliable and so
i think it would be they're not to tune into the channel control and just

we you we'd be a wooden wouldn't be wooden remote control or
and try to find maybe a shape for the wooden remote control

and to kind of have a better overview of what is the fashion in general i have checked more than only the remote control market so next
even if it's in general fashion we want it to be in the remote control

but so you need to come out and you know a microphone sitting there is a remote control
but you need new remote control and then because if you wanna browse internet or i don't know if you wanna type something or
and support you i'm what do we get into that you if you have of what voice control why not to put it back on the t. v.s speed add to the t. v. and you don't need a remote control activity so

that's as team expert told us most of the people want to use the remote control to zap between channels you think that will be able
but suppose you got a cold you have a mute remote control
but suppose you have a family watching t. v. and if we want to use their private remote control in the same time do you think it will work everybody wanting to change channels in the same time
that is changing how the remote control is gonna be bit because then you
and with no increase in the private production price of the remote control
and you will have next time to show was modelling at the play-doh remote control so you want to

and so the colour of the the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control so you will have

because for the intelligent contra you said that we can use the voice recognition are they just recognition that's
and what about for voice recognition do we have microphones and where will be they
but what is the use of voice or just recognition if you have a remote control that like have an object if you
is it do you think it should be only voice recognition then just recognition wall
because i think that would be voice and just recognition there's still some disadvantages for this

could it easy to use simple works fine
works fine so i if
so i if we can have a remote control that is really basic simple then works fine it's already know
if you have something that works fine and he's really a fancy looks and it's easy to use
t. v. in the darkness so if you want to fine you're fine you know your remote control of these are lost in the dark and it's

or you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of them and it can be something interesting to make people buy i don't know
and it can be as interesting to have this kind of
