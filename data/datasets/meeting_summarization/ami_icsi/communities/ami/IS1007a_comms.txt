good money
so that we can sort of designs that's all
it was a little confusion about my but it's
nothing much in the project
and what are your ideas about
about the design know
maybe we discussed use it or not
that's the big thing
annual is a few in a choose from the least so is
and the main no function of remote control is to have something in the hand and
in the hand and they should be very careful about the size of the remote control if they want to have a speech
if they want to have a speech interface i'm not but then trendy slim size of the remote control to be able to put a speech if you if
a speech if you want to put a speech recognition system interface for that i think the t. v. itself could have it

this is the second them
it should be easy to what we've
we can think about an interface with a one
you maybe you can have a speech should recognition interface is still
i think if we could do a lot of technology on the remote or whatever it is a constant
so it's more powerful

or we can put it in the shared folder
i got a know about the disk about this discussion
from the account manager
yes it each of us has a role to do
i don't know much to assign your of roles

did you say less than email about this
one and you use the same button for example to choose among but that's up at least the for anyone so it
so it you don't have to choose them on a hundred channels if you have hundred channels it does have six
i think that's just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to navigate through the channel program are content so in the easy way it's a it's

so we are asking too to make a new remote control for two deviation
two year is it the same
i think is for your that as to how to design it on all the aspects so you need that information

a man
and then there's the only six buttons for six categories also so when the most they only seven
so this choose the category one and you

or you can say for example i one do this all the programme to mine you know
no because you see it now all the t. v. programs that available on the whips big they're
big they're they are available in the x. m. l. format or whatever form and we don't care

you want me to send you mean
so it's industrial design

are for industrial design
but the main idea on its i wanted to say is that and they should be a function is that using that should t. v. channel there's a option you can just add a t. v. channels or four or do or the content no not all the contents of the programme so it's more powerful

working only user interface
when we what we want to have a new really remote control for t. v. distribution i

and marketing and
so we have to if of plan how we would be developed and

i'm working on once we already have it should be something different
and of course it should not be the cost

and about the design perhaps
what is most important in remote control

for example you can get
we should also optimise be the number of access this

and then that's it's all them by the types of programs so on the website
so on the website they are they provide this v.s so we can this use

v.s so we can this use the so these are available downloaded the
downloaded the to this remote control and then there's

good morning to do twenty

good morning

and the characteristics of this new remote control should be or easy know and trendy and of course user friendly

no you can and can you see that uni no i don't know

i think we should set the points to try to project and

not yet but if you

we received an email about this the designs

i suck

you see the email you so you see

very no the first insight

and they come in a two year is it the same

we really had a role

for each possible

kidding

we have functional design conceptual design and detailed design

so who will be t. it's possible function and so you

and so you need you want to you know

i think our responsibilities will be assigned when we in our major we received from the account manager

and in interface

and you number

i mean the marketing

nothing related here too

marketing in this design is this

design is this kind of four industrial design and user interface

since i don't know

even for the marketing

for us as a define

but look at your role you're marketing wrong

as a trend watching

that's euro

i think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and

we can make it work

it should be something different from the other remotes remote controls

might be as we have to keep in mind d. it's characteristics and

i think the norm and i would think about the technical points and

and we should discuss it in the next meeting or

need to collect information

what is the most important function aspect

you mean be extend the spectral

you have to make it work i

is still the television my one which channel or

you know in this is tell this to remote control it's doing this searching for you so

searching for you so you'd have to look for the channel you went to say

you went to say maybe i just wanna press a wanna have a button for the movies tonight

or button for the magazines all the information document they read them like an

like an annual is a few in

so is there pressing the channel number i'm choosing the programs that it be

be that's one way of making it useful

are a lot that this information exists for example

likes it you say we can use speech

i think it's for example anything a the with

the with the idea of using speech to redo the button but any small later on it

i think if you wanted to choose from a list of program our something like that's you may have to use i don't know

and i could talk to the t. v. television itself i mean not have an

it's that if you are far from the t. v.

when we have some rare saw something different economic

this time that's right

but the main idea

on the card sounds

it's a good idea it's a good idea but

but i think that technically would be a little bit to more tricky to achieve d.s don't know

because it so some content with the standard

with the standard should the content and then that's

the most they only seven buttons so this choose the category

it does have six buttons the buttons

this is a good idea
