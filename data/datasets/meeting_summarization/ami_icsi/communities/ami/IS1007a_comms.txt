i'm and you have the option in the remote control if we want
control if we want to have that option you press that button in the remote

it should be something different from the other remotes remote controls
what is most important in remote control
you know in this is tell this to remote control it's doing this searching for you so
i think if we could do a lot of technology on the remote or whatever it is a constant
downloaded the to this remote control and then there's
and just we did which are remote control would just navigate through the
but we're designing this remote control
d. and the have a concept remote control their eyes

but the main idea on its i wanted to say is that and they should be a function is that using that should t. v. channel there's a option you can just add a t. v. channels or four or do or the content no not all the contents of the programme so it's more powerful
because it so some content with the standard
with the standard should the content and then that's
by content or by china it's a good idea
by content know by channel choose
choose by content so my channels so
and then we would have to find a way how to gather information about the contents
but it's a little bit tricky to browse by content so

we received an email about this the designs
we have functional design conceptual design and detailed design
so it's industrial design
are for industrial design
marketing in this design is this
design is this kind of four industrial design and user interface

and the main no function of remote control is to have something in the hand and
in the hand and they should be very careful about the size of the remote control if they want to have a speech
if they want to have a speech interface i'm not but then trendy slim size of the remote control to be able to put a speech if you if

so we are asking too to make a new remote control for two deviation
and the characteristics of this new remote control should be or easy know and trendy and of course user friendly
when we what we want to have a new really remote control for t. v. distribution i

annual is a few in a choose from the least so is
i think if you wanted to choose from a list of program our something like that's you may have to use i don't know
one and you use the same button for example to choose among but that's up at least the for anyone so it
because of the t. v. you read the remote control have a all numbers lot of buttons and then you don't know what the choose
and then you don't know what the choose the end
most important function isn't true buttons to choose the content that we agree
the user can choose which one they wanna

so who will be t. it's possible function and so you
right so are the most functional and is the most important

is still the television my one which channel or
searching for you so you'd have to look for the channel you went to say
you went to say maybe i just wanna press a wanna have a button for the movies tonight
or button for the magazines all the information document they read them like an
so it you don't have to choose them on a hundred channels if you have hundred channels it does have six
it does have six buttons the buttons
of the size of the buttons or it could be anything with the buttons to true's com k. it's or channels so we have both
i think it's not very difficult to browse but channel but it's a

the with the idea of using speech to redo the button but any small later on it
but the main idea
it's a good idea it's a good idea but
i think that's just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to navigate through the channel program are content so in the easy way it's a it's
so you don't have a display you just split
you just split on the t. v. screen a good idea
another interesting idea for this or that though haven't like adaptation system depending upon the picture

and then there's the only six buttons for six categories also so when the most they only seven
the most they only seven buttons so this choose the category
so this choose the category one and you

i got a know about the disk about this discussion
i think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and
so is that the discussing know gets a
right we discussed be either aspect

very no the first insight
i think is for your that as to how to design it on all the aspects so you need that information
what is the most important function aspect
so for now we get the five this is the fashion the design aspect it's the first aspect
it's the first aspect right

so is there pressing the channel number i'm choosing the programs that it be
we should also optimise be the number of access this
their eyes is one of the function in i go in draw something
please number and draw

you maybe you can have a speech should recognition interface is still
likes it you say we can use speech
a speech if you want to put a speech recognition system interface for that i think the t. v. itself could have it
