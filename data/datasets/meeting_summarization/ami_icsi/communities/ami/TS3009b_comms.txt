and then look at the design because
let's look at your design

i have a table where abouts the that relevance of the buttons the power button
so but we do to start with the power button
as a power button always
power button always
so with the power button
we have a power button
the power button seven buttons l. c. d. we know the number buttons
for some of the power button you can
the power button can be

so it's really important to make the buttons for the common other tasks a kind of decor kind of flashy
because the most important buttons and you can

then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions we have to be
so we have to decide on the different remote control functions

and look at their remote controls we
they also say that's about i thought that was fifty percent that more money will be spent on better looking controls so it's very important

one recognisable button in the middle where you do the most important function with and
so it has to be a model designer that's important to
that's important to know where we design thing or
so it's very important that you designed a you can control
that so it's very important we should definitely have that in our design
should we start with the most important parts the l. c. d. screen

as a bit pity because he just do most people want to have one remote control for all those thing devices they can which
so maybe that's a slogan we can put somewhere on a remote control or something alright then
but nobody with a menu know about the remote control
works you have the energy the power of the remote control
but this is very it doing the shape of of a remote control
of a remote control does very little buttons and but
little bit on this remote d. control so for something else a d. v. d. player or something so

not too many what buttons one recognisable
maybe for the if you don't recognise a button or would you would you like all when you don't know
buttons and but that it's quite you can easy recognise
you can easy recognise the buttons the
recognise what looks more like a calculator to people if you will have the the thing on top
but people don't like it when they're buttons are all over the place that

and the user interface is and can we do with the buttons of course and
so it is also why we have to have a button that says and now busy with the d. v. d. if we had done that and the button
buttons and you can immediately
the mute button i had a lot of that
frequency of a button use
so all those buttons that are two with teletext all
we can make it make a row off like four buttons down yes
they can be smaller round buttons
all the these different buttons you have to

but not to explain how the remote works only
remote works only

is as i already said we could drop some of these buttons
you have one button some said frequency or something in

the power button is used very much channel selection volume and teletext teletext is not an
you should put that's a power button channel and volume should have the most important

the people when they pick up the remote know that we have to do that
i also if someone puts of picked up this remote

do you can put the two or three buttons on the re another section that's

but what if we would first besides the different functions and then look
