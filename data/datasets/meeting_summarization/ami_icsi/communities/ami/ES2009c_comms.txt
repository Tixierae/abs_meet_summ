in the three you i will draw let's go first
so than a participant two
components of remote control we were a kind of gone over this but we have to get
d. buttons there are multiple scroll buttons double for manufacturer but
but to users would have to use more chips
and gisella with their touch screen
i like it to the visible light signalling something to
try to see what kind before we want to can we see have received
the challenge is that current trends right now across the board in fashion in furniture in technology is that a very organic fruit and vegetable i think
different i
different i know i think is
i should have mention is as far as
the case it has a consistency of those stress balls
might be interesting
select
something to sell for now so overall
i have but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that really non issue
responses like you can say good morning remote control and also
and that this is kind of the the big daddy of remote controls here
decisions i think we can just gonna line all three
remote that's just an estimate that
i mean i think that we really have two main selling points i think
and they said they want a voice recognition course maybe they hadn't
course maybe they hadn't thought of that school touchscreen option but
but definitely know what the market is there for word recognition so to
i think it's a low risk option which
so having a secondary source of probably
the voice recognition is just something that it is sometimes
to our colour bowl have
a lot let's see we can do as far as that goes and

that we need innovative design options and it needs to be easy
and the feel of the next couple of years is spongy a rat not something
d. f. a. s. r. though if we can get around to doing piling i thought maybe i casing options like that
great picture
ron
we can just connect that making them right so
no can have to come to some decisions
i think it's the most marketable feature just
you industrial design is
it's fine
and our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under
my head is pending further emails
it is and it would be in a class of it
things we just couldn't not for twenty five euros so
rather selling for twenty five so for thirty but
i'm thinking that it definitely a good idea and i also
we can look at this other manufacturing option
let's say they so that as we will be our our main selling point here
does having poster really up our costs
have for its and you can have a fast you can have
have a fast you can have a cheap you can have
a cheap you can have that quality pick two or three
pick two or three you know you can
it's got voice recognition it can be technically anyway in your room and still do its job

so i will tend to do so more actually in this particular meeting
there enough takes me about that i was
so we're gonna do is have some presentations again master class time in the
it's like a the idea of moving the remote would be enough energy to keep it running so that's one possible
of remote and have the television conduct i mean if
i think we're deathly trying to get away from this kind of a work
the following or a bunch of different interface concepts up voice
there is it's just if it's a question of and how much you know with this i mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money from twelve
do we justify
where you guys come up with these numbers
so i think that's what people would pay for i mean if you're gonna pay
like way of when we take
true and it problem i think we're

trip i don't want to curved
want to curved or very sexy double curved
sea sort of what's trendy what's new what's happening
touchscreen or space and possibly having go two buttons being stuck into the system so
has jokes when it's ready
i mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high-class remote you can expect to use of them
city where we're going to make any more we're not talking
we should go sort out what it what and what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype a that's
be solar powered if one would be but i
of else is no way around that we should
that we should install small backup battery
just a cover those moments when whatever reason the remote has to be exposed to

will draw let's go first is fine by me on
in fact that we already have this for a coffee maker line
for thirty but that's something we can have financed a way of
i say that we provision we go with a touch screen or were you were with your
i think if we do both the house repression costs are going to go way up
we already have research backing voice recognition as you know this can be sold by that
one is cheaper to be are to do the touch screen
it back to but you can have a very tasteful would be colour tourist town kind of
those lines i like that a lot
you know something where it a more advanced form of plastic that has some kind of a tact our sponsor

but a single people on the on their remote control three sixteen or
i have a control for
the ipods which i'm most you know and any
and any then we have the scroll button with indicator pushbutton have like a modern us a bit bulky a bit crazy i
package a kind of set the idea that you can change it you can try
change it you can try changing kind of get
changing kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can
buying another one which can add value to our bottom line

what you tell "'em" probably have to reach some conclusion sometimes and
he case we have a few options plastic rubber or whatever
because i found interesting things
but control right now everybody says they one you were fancier more exciting are sick of this boring
but i think it is possible maybe to use natural colours like
control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that kind of a sleek and what all meeting that's it's on your table or something
i mean as we do a more hours i work on which you

but i don't know whether that would be a powerful have to illuminate a touchscreen so have to look into that
and then as far as the weights shaped we can't do standard one flat trip i don't
which we suspect we should hold on which you hold on to
one do agree with everything that's been sent
i have to say though that another ideas come up in my head if we're really
if we're really not handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand held a remote control and maybe
and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks

we could initially go with all we have and if we can
and if we can find cheap way no
starting point anyway so
and when are we gonna have basic product it's coming up next as soon as an extra
as soon as an extra right
that goes and the the material like a plastic so forth we were discussing that being using like a rubber kind of softer feel
which is the next big thing so that's not gonna hurt

if we do go that route we might have to look elsewhere
interesting question
is you see broken remote controls
take it with that tape and what have you would
otherwise we just it just becomes cost prohibitive what
so i'm getting a right so

and so in pricewise tension that we may be somewhat limited us working d. because
us working d. because of where are manufacture a for sale
red for power on errors for different volume ups and downs and channels up and down someone that and that perhaps
and that perhaps even adding in some see below jokes with the voice recognition idea like
you know you can have a three it's just

my personal preferences are
i think we should have a you know tomato shaped remote controls are anything but
natural colours like it would be as an option that whole organic sleek cleaner
fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty to remember
is can a static one would that be have to if you voice recognition remote control

changeable casings and our design she was possibly talking about including one for extra faceplate with the package a kind of
like for me for instance my of course you make it i got from a break
is it called a logistic set this for the senate the stand out that
senate the stand out that we can just connect
that up like really like take one and say no we're gonna stick know everything we go

and if we to go to rubber double curved case we'll have to use rubber pushbuttons "'cause" the other
ways to use part use visible light for a remote just kind of as a fun gimmick sick
sick actually see some becoming a remote way push it course to have people are
preferences are still my cards on the table

we're very limited
we're very limited by work er manufacturers can offer
"'cause" we're going for basic functionality primarily as
you know i'm use a channel buttons to scroll through the menu if they want to record programs or whatever you know

so current voice recognition so it's up to about eighty speech samples
and record your own verbal labels can connect
feature just because it's so new and
because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places

i don't think that's what would necessarily going for and
and some special components ideas like blocking having the ability to block channels from you for your children and that dedicated buttons for commonly used channels and even night ideas like secured are hidden programming but and again
more we're not talking about selling a zillion of these things we just couldn't
i mean we have to reflect back on what our market research it's a

market we're not going for mass in a messy a city where we're going to make
we could probably maybe shrink the profit margin rather selling for
people was like a t. v. in the basement like way of
i think it's all about falling apple's we need a lot of these things

the if they're not going the wrong name over now we're gonna
it seems fine so
i think some of the suggestions would come up with third definitely a very good ideas changeable casings

mister participant a that is
because with voice recognition
i mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kind of remote

the system so those don't move away from the screen the important ones like power volume and down between channels
why move away from hand-held one that's
if you don't need to pick it up it could kinda be a selling point

i mean just a powerpoint is that
right so this meeting

to think of it is kind of a train the abstract and is slightly more concrete in this
more concrete in this meeting ideally will come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype

right so apologies
the board

are manufactured in say anything about with them so we might have to look
so we might have to look if we do go that

so have to look into that
what kind of figures are we looking at

chips which she calls me here
one thing that i know this is that most remotes operate on a infrared on the infra-red part a spectrum so

o. one thing that i thought might be interesting ways to use
maybe something that looks on a table as would be good even though and hand-held the same time

it is or not really care
you can cut corners

right that's my concern to
if we do go to lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside current my personal

just gonna keep would be environmentally friendly theme that we have going on
the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace really is

one if we just go with one has to go over then when a bad situation
screen

which actually maybe we can play beforehand may
perfect great thank you very

i so because i found
but it's very have the technology has for the voice recognition

market trends
what is the cost look like one is cheaper to

and what's going on the other design field sea sort of what's
options or if we can afford this touch plating or touch face screen interface maybe having the images it be specific that you could

and it needs to be easy user interface
see and the outside or

specific that you could choose your menu ball it's to be
tomatoes

know i think is a why would choose but
this is soft on my head keep in mind but

a rat not something i would come up with z. d. f.
as far as the rubber that we can use a rubber as per the case it has a consistency

interface the interface graphics for the
more or less you guys think that the of the two of them the voice recognition will be better

and what have you would have a problem he's rubber
we can have a duck tape case

if you go to the green know like
great picture that's ron

line that were so
or we can have this very simple touch screen you know as a separate

so you're the user interface guys is aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear or otherwise it's a perceived commands a mechanism
commands a mechanism is that user uses to control the operate operating system he's in a series

controls that are out on the market today i think we're
when we take guarantee something everywhere so having a secondary

just gonna line all three of us can have a chat about it
my estimate is that's the rest to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost is upwards of seventeen fifty euro per remote that's just

good idea and i also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper mean stick to go about this kind of production might
might even the therefore suggest that to

manufacturing option you would never so much cheaper
stream we could

area if it's gonna be about the size of the ipod or whatever you know i we can play around for that they are
selling points i think that casing and the voice recognition

recognition so to say we have the technology we're not gonna use it even though we know what a cell it's a call i don't think i can give that up like really
i would have decided that i think

the prototype a that's a next step will be
a next step will be developing a prototype

we just went through it you discuss
you discuss a either a lithium or a solar power with the solar

why we see a little more like in a calculator but we're not talking "'bout" a while i just have to be
i just have to be out taking some bath for a few hours they think

i think we're buying and selling it to more than just voice recognition people like
they might have a like "'cause" an apple makes these

as but that's done that so but i mean if you look at
but i mean if you look at the catalogue from place that we sharper image or whatever you know they might have a

i mean when i have a little more rounded kind of thing you
rounded kind of thing you could still have the basic buttons on it

and maybe a menu button so forth you know i'm use
i'm thinking of the air port portable you know

this meeting will be about to be conceptual design done as peace process

done as peace process or conceptual design is which is something

is which is something important that we need to do to

apologies for last meeting was back to my attention that

was back to my attention that i did not make the rules clear enough so i will

takes me about that i was good

by me on the wall call it what we know what that would we discussed last meeting possible directions and then we'll

and then we'll make some more decisions on basic r. firm up our idea

firm up our idea of how we want this remote control to look at work so

work so perfect so

without further do or wants to go first as freedom alright given

we're gonna have so far see about today is component design and

sale what i'm gonna be doing is talking see about that

over this but we have to get in to what you tell "'em" probably

energy source are manufacture offers a variety of energy sources the standard battery solar cells are manufactured in

and also there's a kinetic energy possibility it's like

i imagine that we could specify

i don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres

and our costs more and if we to go to

'cause the other buttons are compatible with that

touch screen calls me chips which she calls

spectrum so you notice when you push a button and no you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact

out of it but in fact there is light coming out of remote and

conduct i mean if you what's record your they could be

your they could be recording can actually see like

course to have people are the spectrum that what it damaged him and i anything like that

is or not really care that offer on suppress

that offer on suppress can select like

just as a fun gimmick

just a spiral but

then on to the circuit board we're gonna use a simmons the chip we would

we would have any way round p. t. a. one eight three five

findings

and my question for the u. s. should we looked at the manufacturer you switch to make do with

you switch to make do with what we have a mobile

spent a challenge question

a shop around but with our time

but with our time constraints is that really feasible option

i think we should like there's solar battery we're just gonna keep

something to says apart and

and i was thinking about was thinking away so we could produce v. remote and a variety of different case materials to see a different taste

certain that so can find that one style and

style and say so you know say of the one if we just go with one

can we do marketing

can we do marketing power leading to try

a it's an option and actually there's

and actually there's i've got some research or alien like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now which actually maybe we can

may help us decide for now temporal anyway

great thank you very much different it's perfect

welcome

much different it's perfect so i the

so i the mixes you take it from there

the u. s. with different i

fascinating compelling you know

the base that's looking at what's going on the remote control market right now and what's going on the

are sick of this boring normal functional

it's mind being it may be so we can look into different skin

different skin options or

a why would choose but you know what i mean to sort of and

not like it's scheme but like a holder almost if you could do like we'll ever option or what options or something

might be interesting way to go

so overall i think we should stick with what we're finding every is looking for

every is looking for easy use technologically innovative and this fancy new i think perhaps

i think perhaps the double curved thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now

i like the idea of rubber see because it's

rubber see because it's tense a basis it being durable something they can drop

something they can drop and it doesn't matter "'cause"

so many you go to so many houses used is you see broken

i think that goes against the whole fancy something new line that

computers it has to be one now

one now is so integrate

interface concept but if it for user interface designer

he's in a series of this remote controls that are out on

up voice recognition we actually have some you information from our research design team but

team but to get to know what so current

can connect them to the remote control now our

now our design team research team has been l. c. you know a set up a system in which

up a system in which you can teach their remote control was good recognition system to respond to you with standard responses like

control and also a in a sexy female voice good morning to a

and another concept is what apple has come out with the spinning wheel with l. c. display like on the ipods which

and again if we go a flipscreen i don't think that's a big issue

going for so i mean my ideas here and kind of where i think we're heading is something slightly lighter the regular ipod with a hard plastic plastic casing i think some of

and of course there was command system which are talk a little bit of are already and

and the use of recognisable colours and it's a recognition of the features that around so

lot of good ideas could fax to have

that'd be neat is it called a logistic

based on what meeting presented as far as the various costs and benefits i think i don't know what you guys think about the touch screen at this point

but ten we really afford it "'cause"

really afford it "'cause" it looks like they would be that would be a really it main cost source than right

to produce each one

zero is a damper is on this project

i know it's fine

to remember

i thought or some flexibility with that

from twelve fifty if we wanna give have fit the hand or percent profit margin that would mean selling it for twenty five fifteen was

five fifteen was by seventeen fifty back to you that's thirty five

or top of my head is

from the board

and that's to be fairly the percent of the market we're not going

or were you were with your thumb their own

you know as a separate area if it's gonna be

the voice racked thing i mean

thing i mean if we're looking at the bottom line now we're looking at upping the costs seventeen to get the touchscreen i think we might have to

i think we might have to drop the voice right

to be as we have the cable we have the design in-house i mean

in-house i mean we've come up with this new ways to we're using it for

to we're using it for coffee machines are ready

i can pass you on that email from my a guy and guy down the hall sounds good

only thing on anything about the voice racked

to go way up but it's just put it into become the rolls royce of remote controls it would be

because you'd use up in the number of chips we need to do with each different function

it's just impossible

for a paper to write

so we have to pick between one of the year

by that i'd i personally would tend to have a direction but

a direction but if that's what's gonna sell i think that's we need to go with them a week

need to go with them a week in table this touch screen for next model

that i think a voice recognition as simple already

simple already have d. all the technology in our straight again it's packaged it's

mind but i think the voice recognition would they're both it

they're both it the both gonna push the cost up but

have to do is much design work and

work and sometimes design work as push the cost of thing i mean

and i definitely do it that last comment

risk option which for right now we can have on the market sooner which is on

which is on our best option

started we

we will make the touch screen in favour of voice recognition

are we going to talk now about images are in use for the case and all those things

with the solar power be enough to a few or a voice recognition is can a static

be but i think just keep people from getting annoyed "'cause" sometimes

annoyed "'cause" sometimes all part of else is no way around

it's true we ate it works

we ate it works but the same as a solar powered a calculator in you know how

do you think people or people by remote or they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition is

voice recognition people like we want to work fundamentally the basic many want to right

we have to have buttons on it too as but

'cause an apple makes these really pretentious speakers or the sub offers in like clear in class and and

and and then they got a little for a middle type of speakers i mean when

on something because we need to escape the traditional a shape of remote maybe something that

portable you know like that little part looking thing

i work on which you mentioned we need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium think it back to but

still i mean those lines

you know if it were that tip on this pen is that give is just to get you know something where

just kind of the squishy feel

that's not gonna hurt us either
