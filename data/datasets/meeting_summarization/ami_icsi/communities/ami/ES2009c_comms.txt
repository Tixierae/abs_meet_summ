components of remote control we were a kind of gone over this but we have to get
and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks
control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that kind of a sleek and what all meeting that's it's on your table or something

firm up our idea of how we want this remote control to look at work so
the base that's looking at what's going on the remote control market right now and what's going on the
if we're really not handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand held a remote control and maybe
it's if you can do is squishy non or control looking remote control but to be very

rounded kind of thing you could still have the basic buttons on it
so we are we talking we if you're what kind of buttons
we if you're what kind of buttons we're going to use are we going to use
thing to a certain extent we have to stick with a kind of area a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and

have to do is much design work and
work and sometimes design work as push the cost of thing i mean

control and also a in a sexy female voice good morning to a
is can a static one would that be have to if you voice recognition remote control
do you think people or people by remote or they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition is

and that perhaps even adding in some see below jokes with the voice recognition idea like
selling points i think that casing and the voice recognition
because with voice recognition
and they said they want a voice recognition course maybe they hadn't
that i think a voice recognition as simple already
mind but i think the voice recognition would they're both it
but it's very have the technology has for the voice recognition
more or less you guys think that the of the two of them the voice recognition will be better
the voice recognition is just something that it is sometimes

i think we should have a you know tomato shaped remote controls are anything but
is you see broken remote controls
he's in a series of this remote controls that are out on
can connect them to the remote control now our
but a single people on the on their remote control three sixteen or
and that this is kind of the the big daddy of remote controls here
the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace really is
to go way up but it's just put it into become the rolls royce of remote controls it would be

ways to use part use visible light for a remote just kind of as a fun gimmick sick
i mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kind of remote
like we often see on these kinds remotes is the most basic functions appear that something that
stick with the same kind of time the same basic non remote kind of remote design
what can we accomplish given these parameters that we sort of that this kind of a non remote

i think we might have to drop the voice right

i think we're buying and selling it to more than just voice recognition people like
voice recognition people like we want to work fundamentally the basic many want to right

really afford it "'cause" it looks like they would be that would be a really it main cost source than right
thing i mean if we're looking at the bottom line now we're looking at upping the costs seventeen to get the touchscreen i think we might have to
what is the cost look like one is cheaper to

up a system in which you can teach their remote control was good recognition system to respond to you with standard responses like
responses like you can say good morning remote control and also

the voice racked thing i mean
only thing on anything about the voice racked

what do you wanna consider like an ipod screen which isn't a touch
screen which isn't a touch screen we are still scrolling

package a kind of set the idea that you can change it you can try
good idea and i also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper mean stick to go about this kind of production might
alright seems to me that we could just do the stick with the rubber "'cause" we're probably gonna be using
'cause we're probably gonna be using some kind of rubber for the outside case and also stick with
