a cost
this can open and see if you boring wants to start again and start taking minutes afterwards you guys gonna
that might be a possible but possible problem but i don't know
"'cause" get a ticket no
because we've that's really marketable features and that's
i may get a fact that's button
maybe if you have a trigger plus the scroll then that would get plastic the problem of one thing and scrolling "'cause" then it would need
scrolling "'cause" then it would need to be hat and also use them
so with the colour scheme up the marketing people
so are we done three this presentation
so what i had go on from the powerpoint format is that
and when i speak about method i speak about the marketing of the product so
be a limitations i see this as it were focus on television only
we knew mean it's some more buttons if it were to work on some other but
but you phone and ends

enough to know
and we're gonna evaluate the product and close got
start to programme
so this but not be useful for the favourites and for programming euro that that type of television you in use so
in hold it so that was
so you have like the base station with the the little button for the where's my remote
it came off the scroll-wheels
so this doesn't go so fast as

much time keep this one on schedule so
which means that this product for the life of the life use if it should have a technical problem that we could replace it no cost that was something
that was something that would be interested in
no like a a same card in a in a telephone you know is there
is the rest of that
then we have fifteen
i think that that looks pretty

zapping you know something
case that's true that's
it's very prominent
so here for a t. v. that says
no i it depends on the that's awful lot
it because at the moment is actually very straightforward to look all the buttons you know what
look all the buttons you know what to do it's very simple and this box

like to maybe all the editions
so we can talk about finance there
so have the spanish easier for this
a very calm of colours
that is that's intended to be a button as or just a scroll it's not
just a scroll it's not one of the schools for example if that's when you could push it then be a button

so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product
then we wanna talk about finance of got our
we have special form the way so that's
i think we ended up being quite good to the
we got a couple innovative i'd

is that in your favourite channels or
scrolling through fear it's list
the programme button the program buttons
get a ticket no this is gonna be satellite and you can do things are
me too you have to reach a look at the time

that's the only drawback i see that put all
that put all these other features i think people one thing i'm hoping for these people are not gonna even notice there's gonna be somebody
and are actually quite open to be able to expand the product for later button that those features that some point and it does not
it does not fundamentally different technology to do that
you know is there a call it and it can we make a card and so after this

which i think it's probably fair considering that we have an hourish manufacturing a parrot that was already
and i'm assuming that the locator beacon we you know the
but we've got a curve in a group i don't
so we come in uganda fifteen on that one
if it's a little bit more than for single curve so

it can be made for this and that
that can be made for a somewhat place to an l. c. display and i
then we have fifteen point eight euros
it was a pretty accurate have to see
it wasn't bad

you guys gonna give a presentation of our one their products that i can
which was one of the marketing things great
think we get a square all we've got the the locator we've got the durability we've got the dependability we've got
or wanting to make a name for itself or wanting you

it's the unit price unit
scroll wheel for the channels and
and ten this is the power button we have our
that was does that the rest of making unusable as or making it less it because

things great deal scroll
is that single curved the double curved
we're under the power on the back part of the presentation where we
presentation where we have a look at the criterias that the whole exactly in haiti and appalled is gonna can we can use that to channel has it gone

and then the volume controls are here and here you've got the
the other part would be got you know the court corporate
we have reliability we have comfort we have ergonomics we have environmental least sensitive
and the corporation we're talking about where were in you were in new company or wanting to make a

we have our we have the enter
computer can demonstrate that the page inability
exactly that's exactly what those are four and there's
any thoughts how we have we done

the program buttons so this
so but plastic is the white area of this of the model here and the red
talk on all the time
hold it so that was the marketing perspective

so maybe in a final design phase we might treat that a little bit but
spare i was wondering you
that was just our technical team it up the production cost of the individual units
no we just use it as a scroll

i think we did pretty
any other change it thoughts
so that that room for creativity
in the room

and here's the agenda for this meeting
that was the result
i like that the logo on there as

three
the third thing
of that way that they're going in a great detail we have that we have a product that has the features in

so what we ended up late
is that could that be easy to use for the scroll wheel to be rotated f. eight ones on it
for my evaluation based on what the competition is i if i think that we can go after this and

of course this is clay
so all i have a little spreadsheet for a spare
it do you think that's fair come from our manufacturing

you know someone that's over some blacks
that like this whole lot
so we're going to sixteen point four

or wanting you to find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price one thing
one thing i would want to see is is can we get a lifetime a guarantee on this product a normal use guarantee which means
pushbuttons scroll wheel rubber we have that is that's

"'cause" if we can make this unit and credible then would but can we talk
but can we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything but that's
everything but that's that was just an idea i had like to maybe all the

when you talked about fifteen twenty euros as one and how you cannot about think
of four euros a comment a solar cells which
that looks pretty spectacular

of got our lovely excel spreadsheet that knocked up in a five minutes so that's and
so is that the final colour scheme as

is just t. v. functions plus the locator which was
but i think we might scale down the final model of it or is

have the enter button and
button and was the other button here

here and the red there it is like a rubber covering so
haven't made of view assumptions here and that i'm assuming that are power about that we can make for a cost of four euros a comment

see that's pretty you know i know
so you can take it off to is that would be denying you can press that and you'll be a cost a

that is that's like the options for like different data models and things as be some of them
no it's not in there because i have a computer problem and i couldn't i couldn't created i couldn't

i don't think it is that if this guy who wants to talk to anyone
my see my suggestion is we're gonna go to the silver some blacks like most of the televisions

about the skill
the skill yes

we have the characteristics
of i don't know what we call the other part would be got

so the features i think we get
i don't say for one reason so more than i don't think more

i am for my evaluation
but i'm open to market is another direction

i do think we that we don't need the advanced chip-on-print we only need the the regular chip on print so
and we we have a single curved

hang on that those big so same here
and that we do we have any we have special form

the we haven't talked about any special colour little
what's that's a very special it's pretty

so we forgot that to switch again

and i'm gonna evaluate it then

got forty minutes to do this and we should be

and we should be fine much time keep

and private thingy

production costs estimated by our manufacturing department then the research department which is a is a fifteen point eight euros so much but

unit price unit production price cost thing we implement

we implement the basic functions which is just t.

and we implemented that but the way of putting then you when you're functionaries i think your favourite channels functionality in the scroll

t. v. that says that the cradle unit and this is the

and this is the actual remote itself

so the scroll bar is the scroll wheel is this the screen little scrolling guy here and then the volume

you've got the keypad this is the numbers from zero to nine and ten this is the power

is a teletext

start that's the start

covering so you can see that what it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all

and the buttons are all gone be rubber so it's pretty hard to actually damage it

it depends on if it sliding but

sliding but i think it's pretty ergonomic you can feel

this is clay

the power button is a bit of a reach but i think we might scale

i know that would make sense

of it or is this is a bit larger than it would be but

the locator function

it's great rest of the three feature

so the table it that those but they did it to charge off of them

there's one other feature that we're debating but we decided to go against it is

we're thinking that might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this thing it's

it's a kind of feels like there should be something there but

there should be something there but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put their we don't

we don't wanna actually be hitting the power button like that so

no this is just what we had to work with that time

the scroll-wheels problem with them not picking

so gonna find my my folder up they're gonna do my note

up they're gonna do my note that the board

can i get your get tax from your shared folder now

i couldn't do it in the powerpoint and i think if that is

and i think if that is really strange cable so

is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt choose changing situations in the meeting room

so what we had if we had the method

that's not a spell method is it

and to me with this product we get to we get three things to market we've got three features

got three features

but the corporation is ten minute right so

we've got you know the features that makes it was a unique product

the characteristics a talk about we have reliability

that has the features in the characteristics in the background i believe to make it marketable i believe the cost of thirty five to fifty euros we're gonna be competitive

we're gonna be competitive and we're gonna have a market niche

the u. v. g. i. r. d. that we're better going for the higher cost down bring it down to twenty five as we probably could but warning a profit margin

that would be that would be i think a decision best be the corporate

after this and go after more of the exclusivity sense then the mass market sense

which you guys can put a great product an attack

an attack costly think it to there's nobody else is putting this combination of ingredients together be a limitations

there's gonna be somebody going on with a list this thing doesn't work from i. d. v. d. in my but i like these other thing so they keep it'll take it back

what it what i thought so i had this can this unit be produced in a way that makes it upgrade a ball

we we could get another version of it that actually works but

i was wondering you when you talked about fifteen twenty

on print so the minimum miscalculation there

not entirely what's in the target group

in a group i don't know whether that

it's single curved

you think i'm not convinced

we save one euro that we so we

single curve so it's fifteen point eight that's what we came

eight that's what we came up with it

hang on that

but the we haven't talked

we'll look at what's up

it's kind it's frightening we i care

how we have we done today

no i think we've come up with the attractive marketable product and concept

if there's plenty room we got a
