because we've that's really marketable features and that's
and when i speak about method i speak about the marketing of the product so
no i think we've come up with the attractive marketable product and concept

you guys gonna give a presentation of our one their products that i can
and we're gonna evaluate the product and close got
one thing i would want to see is is can we get a lifetime a guarantee on this product a normal use guarantee which means
which you guys can put a great product an attack
new ideas for the product or four of the environment or whatever

three
it's great rest of the three feature
and to me with this product we get to we get three things to market we've got three features
got three features

and ten this is the power button we have our
we don't wanna actually be hitting the power button like that so

have the enter button and
button and was the other button here
covering so you can see that what it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all
so you have like the base station with the the little button for the where's my remote
i may get a fact that's button
we're thinking that might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this thing it's
we knew mean it's some more buttons if it were to work on some other but
just a scroll it's not one of the schools for example if that's when you could push it then be a button

so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product
there's one other feature that we're debating but we decided to go against it is
of that way that they're going in a great detail we have that we have a product that has the features in
that put all these other features i think people one thing i'm hoping for these people are not gonna even notice there's gonna be somebody
and are actually quite open to be able to expand the product for later button that those features that some point and it does not

the programme button the program buttons
the program buttons so this
so this but not be useful for the favourites and for programming euro that that type of television you in use so

then we wanna talk about finance of got our
talk on all the time
i don't think it is that if this guy who wants to talk to anyone
the characteristics a talk about we have reliability
and the corporation we're talking about where were in you were in new company or wanting to make a
so we can talk about finance there

production costs estimated by our manufacturing department then the research department which is a is a fifteen point eight euros so much but
single curve so it's fifteen point eight that's what we came
eight that's what we came up with it
then we have fifteen point eight euros
eight euros right

it because at the moment is actually very straightforward to look all the buttons you know what
look all the buttons you know what to do it's very simple and this box

we've got you know the features that makes it was a unique product
that was does that the rest of making unusable as or making it less it because

it's the unit price unit
unit price unit production price cost thing we implement
t. v. that says that the cradle unit and this is the
or wanting you to find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price one thing
what it what i thought so i had this can this unit be produced in a way that makes it upgrade a ball
"'cause" if we can make this unit and credible then would but can we talk
that was just our technical team it up the production cost of the individual units
we raise the price of a good attitude new technology to it so

things great deal scroll
scrolling through fear it's list
so the scroll bar is the scroll wheel is this the screen little scrolling guy here and then the volume
here and the red there it is like a rubber covering so
that is that's intended to be a button as or just a scroll it's not

i was wondering you when you talked about fifteen twenty
when you talked about fifteen twenty euros as one and how you cannot about think
so we come in uganda fifteen on that one

maybe if you have a trigger plus the scroll then that would get plastic the problem of one thing and scrolling "'cause" then it would need
scrolling "'cause" then it would need to be hat and also use them
