like that and this so i'm just saying for links into the different
simple would go with the push button
right you could link with the scroll button and
my personal preferences i think we could go
source that are i think that's quite an advanced kind of technology is not been
attractive as and
as and also energy saving see all producing the energy you don't need an x. then also the battery supply all solar panels you just
and gives you more flexibility that i'm probably
we could possibly have the scroll on the push that know what
the keyboard so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard you pressing
and if you wanted to go on to teletext or i don't
still have the money if we keep it simple
does anyone have any question
so you're pushing the light is coming from the bat i can appreciate
so that's it'll go to keep on track with that and the third most
and the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use
so pretty basic there

and do we have to make some key decisions on our remote control concept and how we're gonna make a what it really is and that sort of thing the meeting
although you can see on my screen
been doing some research into the different components that we could use what's available to us to actually make the remote control test
that good to look into renewable and
i'm what i said with the
there's just one that i like the kinetic
you can have the solar energy then you can store the energy in you say it just needs to
or just like pick it up
or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it
but that we could incorporate some of the graphical user points as
sort of like pictures taller than
so it's a keyboard in the shape of it right
we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for remote control as it would be
and jerry question is
if there's back up
be bold and innovative and hope this

and that at e. d. of course that's the light emitting diode so we
but that brings it thing we need to be recharged and the bulk the size of it as and then
and then not so great to dispose of environment b. i. there's
every once in awhile i think but
slide f. and so we're all quite familiar with that is on the while so computer up pop up
display and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult
that know what l. c. d. so we can't afford on
i'm what i said with the rubber casing is that would be were rubber encapsulate in all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as
i think of maybe a mixture of paris and maybe
i like the kinetic energy source idea
it's not on my screen why
up if it's flat then i got like on a cell phone a mobile phone so called a flat and
flat and you just have to sort of pressed on these tiny little buttons but
something that out the dimensions of it "'cause" if
i'm you could work out fits in the casing about causing too much difficulty job be fine
and so the so you know my method

the back so i had so many buttons on and the shape was so some that's that are be pressing like a volume but instead of that one button because
that we could use metal we could use
got some good the advances in technology with our
but a lot of calculators "'cause" i somebody that could
i'm just gonna receive it interface concept with his know i a
maybe that's on an l. c. d. screen or maybe it's
so sometime asking
like an l. c. d. screen
interface and then
the infrared is that's considered a
so we can live up to our purpose of having a very fashionable remote control that's right
maybe for the television that people have in the kitchen
this range
do you work with rubber has already given the market but
'cause it's quite fit in with the trendy

so we're ready to start
where you manually charge it up the power like you
it's it stops it i mean it
i mean it would use the impact if it's got to something as "'cause" they wouldn't damage just it's not so easy i think of maybe
so the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casing is rubber and the
and the buttons are they say are rubber
i think that might be a little impractical know
so the support
so the support is about the trendwatching
but i think we stick to t. v. based you know maybe t. v. shows or
i think we could possibly you take a more abstract design like look at the basic
or a store we see the relief of displayed

is that they're all different options are all separate
against f. lee back inside the guy that i
be come in like incorporate that with the scroll button as to the to
that means you're at
i have a shorter report free to do it it took
it took a while to get this
time around i also spoke with fashion experts in one york and paris and
and i looked at the design reports from previous years here real remote and just so can
and just so can we can work off of them see how fashion to change
so i'll this is three most important aspect that come across and
and they reach more port and then the one that comes after it at the first one is
the first one is that they should be a fancy look-and-feel and so the current functional look and feel

and all that positioning in the circuit
they'll include good like ten to earlier there are these different options
we've developed some got some good the advances
a first of all explain what the user interface us
so sometime
asking
now i think it's just a ways back so samples that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control and
the top or a light up ideas on the gonna stick to that's and then
and then tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness
it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that i find rather jarring everything else
kinetic are we going to have

source we could make any we could have any kind of style would be as have
to do is calculators
i think sometimes that's just sort of it and they're question then
i suppose
product so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand
so that would have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons or something
of course is we've worked hard for the personal face plates in this meeting and
plates in this meeting and like sticks that fruits
that fruits and vegetable things i dunno if that's going to work for us sound
for us sound something that you'd use on kitchen where i dunno if we wanna
i dunno if we wanna do it all remotes it could

i don't think you would really be with kind of cutting edge technology wise kinetic
that would be maybe for future project
like as a backup for something
we could easily
because command interface requires you to type text role commands and input at the keyboard so the numbers
i certainly think of symbols for like the volume displayed and like that
as a button know so it's a keyboard
the second most important aspect is the remote should that the remote control should be technologically innovative so i can we do
do it all remotes it could be one the options maybe for the television
one or a house now

rubber which might be mall ideal for the anti r. s. i. e. it's
but at the choice of buttons as we've developed some
with our research team of phones and in new multiple all options scroll buttons i think that was
i think that was brought up for they
to the seasons like that and
i'm probably there is regular chip was supposed to simple we could possibly
back of the
but people don't have to worry about that
we will people just use a battery if there's no that's

but they on thought it was that aren't with the l. c. d. that means we need really advanced chip and
also got be integrated push button which is what we made for you it's very
don't know him i think i just use the mouse
as it would be less complicated and the controls would be more user friendly
up and so if they were black would be possible for them to like that
i'd it seems like an internal like it's a that comes through so that would have to have
one colour it's face could have its own colour of button
and so it's lot a lot field but it everywhere so maybe
right given that information we need to start making some more specific decisions

does main internal feature it is a circuit board which contains all the that at it on x. and also the contacts with that power source is not
diode so we could so we've
and everything is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior we were talking about putting on interchangeable plates it's
it i don't see how all of like a rubber plate going on top or would stay there you go sort
there you go sort of like a clip on plastic plate it
like plastic with rubber can get on top
there's there's certain phone that has like a rubber case in that like
two of them possible i don't think it would make that much different something that out

like you wind up something
they quite flexible design more than you don't have to use individual buttons you can just
but what think the scroll buttons though it
i the exterior is
the exterior is the one thing as protecting it's it or it's
to also mind i
that's a very good point

is not been seen before so it could be quite a novelty fact attractive
you just give it a shake that sounds
it would work that way
so there is a one battery be as most remotes use two batteries i believe so
so i can we do a lot talking about that just with the lighting in
just with the lighting in the buttons and face plates

of style would be as have your body and
so it seems we did see more research on it or i dunno if you could
like as a backup
and they're question then
all something to happen in contrast to last in the feel the material is expected to be spongy again we've already
but still around right

you know you can shake a few times or whatever and
but the buttons are pictures
i'm happy make a
the so you know my method was mainly web-based research this time around i also spoke
this should be a priority has it been saying the second most
again we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons

but the functions course of ones that are always helpful
and maybe learn from mistakes of all are interface that can be too complicated for people to use
do you think that we should keep all the buttons so one same colour just to keep it to the simplest o'clock
i thought we had decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line up and so if they were
but i you mean from the back
so we have to decide now exactly what we are going to do so energy

welcome to the third meeting conceptual design that's a
on the agenda for this so this particular meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we can up with some general ideas of our design and
you mean different colours for the lighting or
if it's doable we can do
so you know to take it out of

of thing the meeting will be forty minutes one and
one of your rubber from our kick-off meeting we talked about our favourite animals so maybe
and there's been sitting your powerpoint presentations to the
it didn't for the first one or a house
it didn't be one of our selling points

are all separate apart from the chip which will probably decide whether we buy a simple regular advanced we can do is that later
i was i suppose a on and on some buttons you would have the power would be some kind of symbol and if you wanted
be more than the numbers and the volume
and then just really like a strip it down to like really basic shape so i mean we don't have to
doing instead of fruits and vegetables just if you look at it

slightly i know i've had a remote control before which you can tell which is the front and the back so i had
inside the guy that i didn't think that's quite a today with what we're looking for here
might be more difficult to do they're
they're they're sticking up if it's
a home for it project

some alternative
some alternative just in case something went
but it is the kinetic thing i think was stressed about lies it's instant energy don't have to
don't have to you know you can shake
and the phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons that actually you know that control controls that are behind the rubber so you

but they never presentation alright thank
and a point device for example a mice for for a control that
the cat are we've decided that the
control i think that's a kinda
i think that's a kinda

which is was that sort of thing like the symbol on the button that if we having a
like how the buttons
i like that idea
the recent fashion update to have a quite a fashion watchers in paris and milan is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture
just if you look at it straight forward is a bit

everywhere so maybe we can still purses of all
can still purses of all those on off but i
like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables and then just
it that's the current frame that or
a wimp should see what the success of the first face plates are busily to keep in mind

that's a powerpoint presentation up and running
and i will switch up powerpoint
so you can feel the we were talking about
we were talking about it being more

and we'll all once again have poppy is our first present to and i
inside or same for them like a lot of speakers and then you have
'cause it's just very control
a lot more tangible

there's the high and how it dynamo which is the sort of thing that was used to which is fifty years ago the ousted
all the solar power which
power which we've been sitting inside a building which is where it's gonna be used might not be quite so useful that
circuit i don't think it would matter the buttons would be through there the top casey i'm you could

but like i that back in time i don't think you would really
it's in the hand we don't want something that's you do and you can take up all too small
all too small all at two
are colour schemes

as far as i know it should be
to make the buttons of all the different because it's a different choices and things it can be a bit
and that all interfaces are different so
so that doesn't improve

you can watching t. v. in the dark then
given the market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
frame that or maybe we could go more directly i don't
pretty straight forward

the time it can be stored it can be like
like a little find inside
because a lot about a house cat our dog
that's like there is no i wouldn't work right

so i mean we don't have to make something in the shape of the score agree but you could have because that was your real swimming or a store we see
like you know like photos of fruits from our product
or banana shape i
one thing i was thinking that was one of your rubber

be displayed it
instead of a battery like so the
like a few hours a day

test will have to look at how the remote control is actually made and what
so that as the energy
that as the energy we've decided on and kinetic right so

source is not necessarily a battery is about to see there
there are several components of the circuit board that we need to consider when i will be getting them from what they'll be made of
titanium is not to be possible in know it just to be on top budget really that

and that would be to an advanced
i don't know when people will be movie remote around a lot but i think
that might turn that

i think we could go for the kinetic energy source that are i think
that sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about
i just wanna make this pop up

case in that like an orc it is yes
that doesn't improve to use the product so we need to come
and if you wanted to this "'em" in we make

is it possible to plug designs on to this type of rubber
to stick graphical user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for like that and a point device
i mean we do have to set in one colour it's

us it's aspects of the computer system which can be seen or otherwise stage for example hey rick or shall we are they are by the human user
and it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and input data
this "'em" in we make i mean depending on what kinds of the design minutes to just black buttons

i will rubber is
i will rubber is some more translucent product to use so
job be fine

but diodes transistors resonators resistors and passes it could pass it is all need to be considered as
we can do is that later

i like out the most like effective circuit i'm thinking of a why is and things like that and that at e. d. of
we made for you it's very straightforward to be come

it be kind of strange to we speak rating are they
maybe be if to be if it was just kind of remorse rubber coating which is on the case so

button because you can't really see but you know
we also can choose what materials

you can just slide f. and
i'm the kinetic energy would probably deep into the budget

a lot but i think that it's worth it could be kinetic
but they still need to fit in to people's the core though

somebody that could be quite a
maybe that could be the back up instead of a battery

like so the packet
to be more command interface and

a keyboard you pressing the numbers for for you want
so you must for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics like an l. c. d.

thing you can have it as a little picture we have a screen is lines across it which is was
and power

than just make it more if you look at made me
i can't think of an example but

since it's quite an use technology
we also have to keep in mind more design an hour more user friendly remote control that a lot of interfaces consist of a quarter of buttons that

i think if we go with the design plate thing will have to just because
just because of colour clashing and

of it "'cause" if it's just like constructed in the same way as but the front cover mobile phone you can you take off the hard cover and then there's the makes it the buttons and then you get the
and then you get the circuit i don't think

more directly i don't know that
know that initially i did i think

just escape the thing
i think we should just like take advantage of by using this was for potential there

is actually made and what happens inside the casing because wall you'll feel does

made of including the integrated circuit which is also known as the chip which is where

which is where all the main inspiration is that contains

all the other thing is the individual components so we'd have to get it in separately i like

could so we've got like flexibility with liz and things that are that's all

there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source we could use

we could use the basic battery but that brings

the ousted a kinetic energy

a kinetic energy is something that's been we still need about that

what is the hand power dynamo

several so while are constantly

wise kinetic energy is a new idea that's been used by some watches and that devices where you just shake in the device and it gives it to power i mean the

i mean the kinetic energy is transformed into a power to make a circuit what

into renewable and you know if they like

lots of considerations for the case like what sorts of shape it would be curved or flat that's got

or flat that's got a lot to do with the economics anyhow

anyhow it's comfortable and since it's in the hand we don't

all at two slightly i

that we could use metal

we could use rubber which might

s. i. e. it's like at the same sort of rubber that's used and stress balls and things that says r. e. i. not so stressful on how does that would

buttons though it did we

and it's unlikely that's gonna be in a project also

for links into the different depends on what type of buttons we have an input

and the advanced would have to go with a l. c. d. c. display my

that sounds pretty easily

but the casing i think we're probably the best if we're going to be anti r. s. i. d. and it's like more choice with a static so he could be pretty

so he could be pretty much any kelly we want

i think that would it at that would be an end so more internal casing and the rubber would

and the rubber would just be that what's in contact with the human eye

the case so it's kind of the whole thing would be removable

you can get sort of outside casing far ipods and something that's just as protective as it's it stops it

just for environmental reasons

it is it's a bit scary "'cause" it hasn't been done before

on it or i dunno if you could have a battery pack

i believe so it was running off one battery is the

you were saying about solar power not maybe not working and doors but a lot of calculators

although it needs some light doesn't it

the thing is it's not you don't need to so all the time it can be stored

so how it works

in you say it just needs to be in like for a certain amount of time paid a like a few hours

this was it would be really annoying if you get do you think no i've got to charge for a remote today but it is the kinetic

and it works

my screen why

there are two types of user interfaces to stick graphical

i'm not really but the picture so maybe that's

teletext or i don't know having that but i mean a similar thing you can have it

that if we having a simplified display anyway you that will probably won't have to focus so much not be more than the numbers

so that's just off the graphical for the pointing aspect

so this is pointing device that doesn't include

it could be any scrolls thing and something come up on the screen

that's the time l. c. d. type things

i think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway to make it more

anyway to make it more simplistic but that

time for you

the remote control would be cheaper design that we have more money in the budget to be target the design area of the interface to make

interface to make it more trendy and we still have the money

but the lighting up affect

if they were white they would go probably if they're made

probably if they're made of rubber

from the bat i can appreciate it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it out fine words but

so that they're taking care of

it should be able to

so you can change the buttons when you change in the face it's generated mean

generated mean "'cause" it's just very

they insert over

what's the raised up buttons so you can feel

i think two of them possible i don't

so my personal preferences here

the s. and since rubber

of displayed in a really make it a quite abstract if that's facing more with what we doing instead of

i did i think if we just sort of turn it on a bit

tom that like you know like photos

so maybe that could be animal base you know because a lot about

that might be getting you know to specific a wimp should see what the success

are busily to keep in mind

some need to have the powerpoint again

we're here to say three

project documents i think

so energy we go

know i can read it in one it's in the same thing

are we going to have a back-up

bought a back-up would really be necessary

i think maybe we could just go through the kinetic energy and

and hope this works and i hope that it works i think i think
