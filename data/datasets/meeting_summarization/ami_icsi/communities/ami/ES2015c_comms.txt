as i'm has its own buttons are you don't necessarily need to have it on remote

but at the choice of buttons as we've developed some
and the buttons are they say are rubber
as a button know so it's a keyboard
what's the raised up buttons so you can feel
what we're gonna do but the cost of buttons functions course and forms and that and say yes like what
it's just and where shall we look it the buttons what
there you can have some fun with the buttons that's true

i was i suppose a on and on some buttons you would have the power would be some kind of symbol and if you wanted
which is was that sort of thing like the symbol on the button that if we having a
this "'em" in we make i mean depending on what kinds of the design minutes to just black buttons
it the buttons what kind of functions will show we have

so you can change the buttons when you change in the face it's generated mean
one colour it's face could have its own colour of button
just with the lighting in the buttons and face plates

interface to make it more trendy and we still have the money
and that all interfaces are different so
in a way different interfaces are very different and to

so we have to decide now exactly what we are going to do so energy
that as the energy we've decided on and kinetic right so

with our research team of phones and in new multiple all options scroll buttons i think that was
but what think the scroll buttons though it
be come in like incorporate that with the scroll button as to the to
right you could link with the scroll button and
we could possibly have the scroll on the push that know what
that sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about
it could be any scrolls thing and something come up on the screen
so it depends on what we wanted to scroll buttons or just the push buttons

i thought we had decided that we would if you touch on the buttons that all line up and so if they were

they quite flexible design more than you don't have to use individual buttons you can just
also got be integrated push button which is what we made for you it's very
so that would have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons or something

been doing some research into the different components that we could use what's available to us to actually make the remote control test
to make the buttons of all the different because it's a different choices and things it can be a bit
you mean different colours for the lighting or
two of them possible i don't think it would make that much different something that out
like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables and then just
and to be confusing because the course of a difference mccall's of the different cost report so
ideas like five different

the back so i had so many buttons on and the shape was so some that's that are be pressing like a volume but instead of that one button because
flat and you just have to sort of pressed on these tiny little buttons but

and do we have to make some key decisions on our remote control concept and how we're gonna make a what it really is and that sort of thing the meeting
slightly i know i've had a remote control before which you can tell which is the front and the back so i had
now i think it's just a ways back so samples that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control and
and the phone that i was thinking of as when you change the cover so but the lower buttons that actually you know that control controls that are behind the rubber so you
control i think that's a kinda
so we can live up to our purpose of having a very fashionable remote control that's right
given the market but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
'cause it is a good sales plan to say and you know the remote control them all these patterns this one
we five real something that you granny would want a remote control

there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source we could use
i think we could go for the kinetic energy source that are i think
i like the kinetic energy source idea

because command interface requires you to type text role commands and input at the keyboard so the numbers
to be more command interface and
i think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway to make it more
we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for remote control as it would be
that was called command interface
command interface so
command line interface
it's a command line

like that and this so i'm just saying for links into the different
for links into the different depends on what type of buttons we have an input
