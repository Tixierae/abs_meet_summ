so you have the colour take a
colour take a say that would be a seven i only

scroll wheel with push button we had no it's for
if it is push button and then you get a zero point five it's a scroll-wheel
five it's a scroll-wheel so we've put its push button and a scroll-wheel an l. c. d. display so
i thought we would have into this as a scroll wheel spinning wheel and push button thing
and then anyway and the scroll-wheel is i mean essentially the t. buttons that is not

because i mean anyway year i said people would be able to scroll wheels and so it's
scroll where have scroll wheel as
see i was gonna say the scroll-wheel pushbutton think "'cause"
take it down to just a scroll wheel
the scroll wheel is on the side
unless we just take off the scroll wheel together in just a push
i mean the scroll wheels pretty but

back and forth and then if you needed into something on the screen you just push the send in the middle button
to have to sell at a push button and them
do with the push button means that counts by what the week that and think that makes
how do we make a selection if you do cannot push the button
push this one but we don't have a push button i would we don't have this meeting mechanism for the scrolling thing
in just a push buttons for volume
the instead of having scrolling we just push the button

the volume is scrolling on the side this
so the volume is you just scroll but then once

an easy a seven point scale say you wanna is
say you wanna is in a yes it a team each one a requirement and seven is
and seven is no you really doesn't we need to get back and start again you need
so to each of these we need to give it a one to seven is that right
so seven was in the maximum i go for seven
seven it's terribly
a case they were all agreeing on seven for a call
was control have a seven

and again i'll take minutes to
have to say that "'cause" i'm taking minutes if we're aiming

but we which makes it kind of are really think
this kind of that makes more and
if i if this means it's easier if it means the way people kind of i used to finding things and it's
so that might be a little more difficult for people to get used in the big it so it is kind
or maybe if you want some kind of patterns thing

but that but to me it but the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute right
but if you hold it in if it's a scrolling
a base a scroll and like isn't it
if it's a scrolling click so you hold it in
it in the l. c. d. we can scroll right how do we make a selection
you can have to scroll it straight to roll it straight down from you
keep l. c. d. display the instead of having scrolling

but it seems to turn into like just one point
'cause that i mean the standard layout for numbers it is three one rather than the wave got it i really
one two three
three six as a
six point plan that
so that's point three
one point three for the moment
rather than having three different things that people have to do
and then you know you come back three days later didn't get like i really i have

say we need the average here so you have
right so we need one fifty or
we need we've got no way of finding out

that six point five close enough
six point five
twelve point five
our budget twelve point five

then this one's would be for flipping the canals back in like the previous
and it's on the back is a cover more back later because if you flip it open you can still do the scrolling

off button it's quite standards in place for it and and
and button supplements

and things and then i will explain d. the user interface any of things like the buttons and the scrolling thing
so what michael will explain you are user interface there and
and we have the user interface or in here and
everything else is probably user interface so
say so at the user interface as we discussed last time work on the on the colour we just have the very basic things so we have that
rate so it's kind of user friendly and then this one's would
it a does it match the operating behaviour of the user
no it says what is the kind of interface if it is
so that's a three kind of interfaces that we have
