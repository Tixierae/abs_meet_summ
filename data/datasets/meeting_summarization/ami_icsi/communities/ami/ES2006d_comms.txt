this is a final meeting the detailed design meeting
i think acts going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against then
then i need to say since a few things about finance "'cause" we
and then we will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design with peter so we've
peter so we've got forty minutes so
i that was the that fifteen to thirty five so we've got and channel
so we've got and channel four jane
how much do we have forty minutes
and it's gonna make a bit smaller and of course
but one thing we actually kind of for court one designing it once i was supposed to be wrong to solicit
say so at the user interface as we discussed last time work on the on the colour we just have the very basic things so we have that
but that but to me it but the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute right
but if you hold it in if it's a scrolling
a base a scroll and like isn't it
and so the all the voice recognition is also just bought a that you can't really see it
it's hidden in there somewhere
you can have a look
so if you have questions
'kay to the test again
test again
it's a sort of intermediate colour
today's just mean and
very quick so
see the budget
yes i did have a p. c. and easy on here but it seems to turn
but it seems to turn into like just one point
say i mean that was kind of negate the whole r. s. i. a. she say maybe
say maybe we need for that means a little bit investigation maybe give it a five
but we have it's it nicely with the hinges c. more was so what's that
but you were thinking about making it smaller
this kind of that makes more and
we admitting defeat and say
and say we say we're gonna stick in my case on the t. v. there's like a to
no we have locator
that we're gonna put a like we got that there's the locator
got that there's the locator dot
close to them easy to that is mean you need a little speaker on a way to know
that you stick on t. v.
to make it beep or buzzer
but the speech sample speaker using to do so it has
to do so it has some look at the system to do something to make some sound so
but otherwise it's cheap the
and i mean i'd i dunno i mean that the repetitive stress things but
a day you know and i never got repetitive strain injury from that's
technology
you reckon five six
it's not maximum fashion fruit
so i think we've done very but
so you've got four seven to say that's twenty
slip by nancy
know a hand dynamo right ones simple
or maybe if you want some kind of patterns thing
let's leave it is zero "'cause" it's easy
that seems unlikely
twelve point five
it does not have for voice recognition where does have
where does have for the feedback speaker then when you say
then when you say when you press one it says one or it says hollow

and the l. c. d. and the scroller inside
everything else is probably user interface so
so to each of these we need to give it a one to seven is that right
i reckon it
it's terribly sexy
a huge problem because it is a credible
this to have taken a little while know that intuitive
unless you're all
unless you're all the time sitting
i used to send fifty text a day you know and i

live on this is one of "'em" out to dinner and a cat a
stress things but then would be you're really pushing the buttons so much on on the remote control anyway
so it's kinda
i think it is a dummy
but at the same time they all relatively new
they've never been used to it and i mean you know a remote control will for evening
a seven i'm right
i think that's a plus
i'll say six is
if you and one two three four five six seven eight

be a problem "'cause" you don't always have all left hand is all right-handers in a family
and a cat a eighty
eighty eight
but in terms of the actual technology none of it is actually in you
but do you think six
is that we can take your that
say we give a seven i'm
fruit and veg it suppose fashionable these days

so in terms of our greatest target group i think it's pretty good but we might want
long it's a little bit long i mean it
point something
word did you have anything more
and we have l. c. display and
and button supplements
so that has implications for me
that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really is no you can

part of it
this is a final meeting
on the side this
less
and the locator also go away
what else does it need
this b. k. and assumptions be case it's expensive but we could

it a does it match the operating behaviour of the user
but we which makes it kind of are really think
so they should be maybe save f. i. even say is
say we give it a six
school but not on the previous slide
it has voice control
one fifty one divided by

people say if you're left-handed that kind of that scrolling with your finger
so but it's not a huge problem because
have to use it be marked to think about it so we do that on the fly
so we do that on the fly you think
not showing up at the things that are there any of the points that's
a little bit or six
ones simple battery know the

so it's for up to four up to seven up to nine and zero here
then this one's would be for flipping the canals back in like the previous
i this comes back from this whole be thing links and they're say
say possibly for left and that's investigate
but i mean every think it's been used in space before it gets to anyone else really hasn't it's a
hasn't it's a i mean maybe three

like seven and i don't do
the only six is one two
one two three
and then the marks
we also set the sample sensor and sample speaker
also a in that case i'm not that you evaluate this as a corpus of this because

and of course it would be shiny and but one thing
and we do have the logo and that's
it won't be handy
i don't think maybe it's integrated with the l. c. display
come on the one pushbutton no

thing to use of it finite
other would be numbers seen in the on the actual one so it's for
so you have the colour take a
it's a week on a weekend

so we have that it channel see a starting from and one two three other would be numbers
the volume is scrolling on the side this
we have the sample speaker as which is
but they have been brought together in a remote

we just send all of our manufacturing to some last paul country
so the process that way
you can tell you what we get
an easy a seven point scale say you wanna is

so i be attractive to look at
say she give it a six
that and think that makes sense
no it says what is the kind of interface if it is

for i mean most people or right handed so
but it's a bit long it's
i mean it can be open like a base of course and
it's a slightly smaller

so you have to keep that side flat
so it works like a mobile phone flipping but you know as long as that's that then that one
we definitely going to have to sell
wall what is the limit or

put fashion in electronics
the cat banana the remote
single curved surface so that we control but
we have to count all the more

so you can shows what you've been working on so diligently
back and forth and then if you needed into something on the screen you just push the send in the middle button
a little bit on the six no

do you expect it to you do we expect that
i thought you need some kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the t. v.
just prepare one

so so is the flip open thing that and so
seven it's terribly
colour take a say that would be a seven i only

and then the whole shapes kind of these i
kind of these i would say that it's have a look quite like a vegetable
was so what's that so it won't be a problem it would be

and that's it with the the black and yellow your even in the right colour
in a rough and then all of them in a case they
how was it does have four

so maybe if we go on to evaluation criteria and then
alright if you take in a rough and then all
six point five

fabulous
marketing expert
that would be rates

and seven is no you really doesn't we need to get back and start again you need
and even the scroll it's a new technology so
so that might be a little more difficult for people to get used in the big it so it is kind

box never mind
or maybe sakes because it's just one
the sample sensor will have to go a "'cause" that's

so seven was in the maximum i go for seven
it's a pen you know left-handed people can we why handed
because i mean anyway year i said people would be able to scroll wheels and so it's

i go for seven
i started feeling a team but
but it's of course is a provisional so we have to go down know a hand dynamo

that's gonna be a problem "'cause" you don't
but then i think left-handed people already use the discrimination anyway so
the length it's gonna be different

and do it might interfere with a i. r. channel
to have to sell at a push button and them
scroll where have scroll wheel as

so is really hard to live on this is one
a week and then from
injury from that's our find it quite hard to believe c. n. s.

and the l. c. display
so that's a three kind of interfaces that we have
so it as we can see that's way too expensive down here

and again i'll take minutes to
if i if this means it's easier if it means the way people kind of i used to finding things and it's

until about four fifteen so
but it's just not approximation

and things and then i will explain d. the user interface any of things like the buttons and the scrolling thing
so you guys can decide whether

do we expect that to there's a vibrate
a control or buses but

there's a vibrate when you press the buttons
and we have the user interface or in here and

so what michael will explain you are user interface there and
and it flips up on the side so it opens like that and we have

off button it's quite standards in place for it and and
i mean how far can you go with a remote control really it still has to

rate so it's kind of user friendly and then this one's would
but otherwise

so what is the volume
it's on the side

uday get that and then
so that you know my we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway

and it's on the back is a cover more back later because if you flip it open you can still do the scrolling
gonna put that in that sense what so on the cover we have the of the bear essentials

that you can't really see it in the interface
intuitive but

tell you what we get these prefer to put had the evaluation of the new design an easy
you might end up having to take off d. sample sensor

say you wanna is in a yes it a team each one a requirement and seven is
it's definitely attractive

of the locator ball thing we actually from
we why handed they can we do make things by hand i'd say

up right so it opens and the side so on
six point plan that

it but it's not the immediate thing that you used to
i have pushbuttons

have to buy i
gee technologically innovative

but that's me assessment
say we need the average here so you have

say that's twenty eight it's three six
three six as a

scroll wheel with push button we had no it's for
it's we had before meeting and

if it is push button and then you get a zero point five it's a scroll-wheel
five it's a scroll-wheel so we've put its push button and a scroll-wheel an l. c. d. display so

what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you too so you can shows what you've

finance "'cause" we have to check fact it's within the finance criteria

and then we'll be making that our product fixed price the evaluation criteria from cat and the financial limits

for fifteen

so is that are we starting

are we starting whether that so

so we you maybe start was like the in the shape and things and

so going with that kind of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of a banana

but you're a control or

that's the whole thing's made of rubber is that

is it's a scale a d. v. make a bit smaller

the way since

wrong to solicit the backside round

the way since it's made of rubber anywhere i think it's

it there's a lot of fun it's like having and then the whole shapes

and it's spongy s. i. say

and then this is on off button it's

for it and and also the call a squeezable from rate so it's

like the previous one and the next one and then we would

and then we would also have a little saying here previous and i present prevent next

say so the volume is

so the volume is you just scroll but then once

but then once you flip it open they have the screen and

and you have a dumb spinning wheel was options to choose can go

can go back and forth and then

all the thing we forgot was like a mute button

what we will have this on the screen on the display

you all you could have it so you know on the wheel if you

no we own like if you hold a wheel down then it will be

on the l. c. d. with you know the main menu will have a these options

if it's a scrolling click so you hold it in

so that's that's also whole meeting she

i think it we could do the logo in grey as it is on the website

we eat out of resources or so

you know the moment but it

but it is you know call them slimy i hate

that i suspect we're gonna have a couple of mine a finance issue is that we'll

that we'll say i'm we can get around them somewhere

whales

labels for example

you need what i did was i went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like a made a list of them

they say that we can really each one and like she's are going back to

she's are going back to the store and saying we did marry speed or i mean are you ready for about that

if you can imagine that they say a. b. c. and d. for that would be really did

i agree

so i just prepared no

i only home also so that it a

that it a are what i've done on the next page is our setup so we just put them all ten

a weekend then

can we can i get i can take notes

then i'll take a that's fine

a case they were all agreeing on seven for a call

be the only thing that we were considering was that the the thing is kind of more for right-handed people than left-handed people say if

so you so when we might do we might want to do like that but none of them a model of the look another version which is like exactly the mere a mentioned this one

but i mean because it's not like it's a pen you know left-handed

by hand i'd say is not such a big ish you

i mean you can use your finger to scroll one and your thumb say

wheels and so it's the majority a right-handed it's

maybe give it a five hours a

hours a cheap what you think

because it's just one money in one on the issue i mean

i think for i mean most people

but we might want to fly get from management they want might want to

one nothing is a

it might be a little clumsy when it opens up right so

i mean so you guys can decide

problem it would be and it would be it won't be handy

add anything else and to this within from the top

but before flip it open only as much as that

i a case they

case they say

go up in this day

completing to

so it's six "'cause"

'cause that i mean the standard layout for numbers it is three one rather than the wave got it i really

than the wave got it i really like the way you have it but it's not

in the big it so it is kind of not very intuitive but

but it's a good technology i mean once they get used to

but it and it's something that they will be experiencing a lot of different places and

i. even say is intuitive but it's different

but it's different say you

i'm gonna give a seven and everything so

i'm battery setting this to have taken

eight

the other work out ornament design

six

was control have a seven

that's the second one so

one so you must to change it on the somewhere it's got school but

that's a seven and

it's the most sophisticated more to we're seen

all of the components of being used in other things before but do you

you reckon five

it's based remote

every she's about six and something a little bit

twenty eight thirty eight or forty six and five fifty one divided

that six point five close enough

that's pretty good i think

now until we get to find them so no more think if we can afford it

that so you've got them a word did you have

it or a slip

also we if we can unscrew this yes

beautiful not anymore

not anymore

no signal

so we've looked at the prototype presentation i mean valuation criteria

and now we have to calculate the production costs so i got an excel

so i got an excel spreadsheet to help us to it acts

can you read that almost

know the kinetic energy know so

the chip we going for an advanced chip-on-print we also set the

advanced

case material we said rubber i don't know what special

i don't know what special colour means

and i think which is not marked

this and coloured

this and coloured probably so i think this is probably

so i think this is probably a special colour know

but that comes calendars in a

rubber comes colours it's i would maybe

it's i would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured all wood coloured that's different

but do we have will have l. c. display but the wall but that was spinning wheel

but the spinning wheels not i

i think the pushbutton

that means you can only have twenty five pushbuttons and take something that not counting

that not counting anything but still been budget

do with the push button means that counts by what the week that and think that makes

what what's our take it

this sample sensor

our budget twelve point five

have to go a "'cause" that's the most expensive thing on the

for the locator

really is no you can afford to go to that

but it was a very not innovative and then in a way innovativeness

so that means made to do that

in a way innovativeness there

expensive but we could just have some very easy device that just beeps

'cause the sample speaker was i think more complicated than just to be changing

in there you record your samples your speech and

of this because it's just rubber so it's probably a flat surface rubber or i mean
