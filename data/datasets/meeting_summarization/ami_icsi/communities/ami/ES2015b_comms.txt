a function f. eight
i have i'm they about this guy is
which is genevieve idea so we need to think
all you need is just a he so they self destruct and cells so
very go back it's
sides can would call those components in
so those are what we look construct of the remote of the
source it could be a battery like rechargeable
how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on television set it up
the notes f. eight again to you escape or
and sound next presenter will be tar
at the technical functions design of the apparatus is the fact the apparatus should have in
and glass functions we have to be included
so as far as we know a single function television remote control is usable internationally
design thing for now because or try to do so much that if we can make a unique user-friendly that that is also a lot of also on multifunctional we're gonna go over budget one
just a moment so
and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design a just an electronic fashion so that it's something that
there you know a masters and
the single from
and another thing with lots of surfing probably have to work on something that could be a lot more durable because that's fine with
and actually go with that i'm gonna give you some statistics on the relevancy of each of the buttons how much they used and
used and how important that users find them so the power button
or put this is a train on off the t. v. but
like that i can send emails and you know like to see
to get away with that and it
and so it's not use very often that was to find it that's
biggest frustrations of the people that we interviewed remote
for you a large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls so i'll show you some numbers
in it and have voice recognition or something wanna look into and if we have the budget
that would pay off thing is ninety percent overnight percent before
field of research i dunno fit be if it's to have a remote if you're talking to a television and saying change channel and very handy
and very handy members you haven't household so in may be
and this is conversation and then we aim at the same time although
of people can activate the television with their voice and they will be using them they will be talking it remote i'm
in the last thing here was that an l. c. d. screen so i mean voice
what would it be on the screen
a separate
all on the remote
right way to keep in mind the reliability of our research i mean
the same signal three then you could just like make a little beeping noise is not that expensive

it's plugged in so
that's or was that last multifunctional and
a single function just a television itself
multi function controls can be difficult to use as a lot shape of buttons can be confusing
i think that a single function remote control would be preferable because it's
because it's easier to use it
channel settings
here's some ideas
here's some ideas for you a large percentage of
the remote control so we are you know that it'll just be for the television it'll be one have

so i was looking at how are we gonna go about the working design and what
and what we actually need to do
a power which is chairman the channels that
to than them and at the very start you
is working so they don't have so many buttons to deal with
research i mean you know a sixteen boy would say you had pay extra for voice recognition intel be realise that's the remote slides
so i think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more
would be what is the same reception on the remote control i but the actual device would have to have its own infra-red signal or
but need a battery
i mean that's your department

and it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices it and older and
we'll have more money t. going to the design side of it
are you ready for all your presentation tonight
that's except
except you know looked up to the great
not that but other than that completely ready
it's lost my microphone
right no problem we can
about the real briefly know what that means exactly

so the first presentation
take it away party
to looks like something that we're gonna wanna do some research on in include on our remote control channel
that but n.'s that's don't require you know very for a shame if they respond bubble have
that next
those are the changes
my guest as for my findings looks that one minimise buttons
maybe selling adhesive that you could x. to come to the back of any set that would be not very intrusive all

right sounds great
and it's used on average four times an hour not as much as channel selection
of like information
a t. v. has like information has information on holidays and use entertainment no
but also the weather and
so i we're not to figure out what age group we're targeting in it and have
for it if we are targeting young adults it looks like something that would pay off thing

and then the company could than just use that make use of this shape memory on all these two space that the i heard of that and then
to scrap metal something like the case if it's scratch does anyone wants we use it but you might be able to market down and be sick and somewhere else
people than for instance that's
it looks like
all the other thing is age market i mean if we want to
we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control so

and say was that last thing you just said
watched to influence remote control
so the findings seventy
five percent of remote control users said they zap a lot zapping meeting
and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons that
that a very small amounts that was interesting

the first presentation will be looking at is poppies presentation and
also there's components is will be
work let's have a put this plan to get the
and so could you buzzer
i've no idea still a separate

maybe behind the question of somewhere
and i think that be very important to products now especially
products now especially "'cause" is so much a responsibility for all the companies are coming up with make new designs "'cause"
apart from there that's that hold altogether would be made out of the shape than reality and that's
and that's the parts that it's woods allow all the other parts to be separated at the end maybe use

this one and down being don't touch the powerpoint for at this meeting is in very necessary for myself because it'll be more about
because it'll be more about how what you guys are bringing to the meeting today
it be more compatible with the range of television sets making a more internationally sellable
would look fancy mean that they would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control

'cause this product responsibility to get rid of what they've made and then the
the functional requirements of that was to produce have coffee quickly so
you know who's famous for t. v. shows are being watched
for the menu and you press the page numbers with remote two and they're gonna come on

would we be the company that would break down these so medals or
them so the power button and in ours only used once or put this is a
so people want gotta turn on the t. v. with the remote control
teletext of does that are having to access a three times

"'cause" it sounds very labour intensive we have
we have to hire number of people and they might be more expense of
because of this properties the smart material all you need is
i are we going to write off the l. c. d. option

but just raise what's the energy source it could be a
design as as having that would complicated a lot wall and then it
that's rather sad
i'm assuming that we are you have one bite

so we believe in providing international market with fashionable products
answer motto we put the fashion in electronics so
the little r. yellow thing
use of find ability is important

i dunno for volume selection to ten at and it's used on average
can i just in chip
have you got a powerpoint on that
but my practice

no it's a button that you press the menu at the menu pops up by having use to
somewhere so those are discuss with poppy how we can have a an alarm system so that people can find it
ninety one point two percent so that they would pay extra might have voice rec voice recognition include on the remote control
might be quite expensive to see is that true

too extreme for us not practical
practical an l. c. d. screen though might be something that's you know you can shift two pages kind of all the way this powerpoint is working so
it was a management decisions so
button all

minutes on this one and
if you remember from the email we got for a very first kick-off meeting with the coffee machine the functional requirements of
we need to we probably would have to have that colour in and logo decided upon

it's plugged in so
because i wasn't but it's being used fourteen times an hour
financially and functionally

know we could use it only related buttons which we're
i am the user user interface designer are at
a half to sort that out

buttons which we're all familiar with when we using a mobile phone or something for that for many l.
idea one thing we have to consider is our one hundred percent turnover goal that we have for our financial sector
very intrusive all the seasoning small that's that's

'em bits and the basic jobs you can wear out with time all not usable they might be like bill that's going to scrap metal something like
least not have we not hundred percent and everything we could use that
i probably an essay

so i saw it does a like a high comes out that you know highly a quality machinery in for instance if it machinery but
i like the environmental approach
that's it for the market research

they're to be functional design options a multifunctional
a multifunctional remote control which can be used for several entertainment devices and the single function
which is good as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway for many reasons

i was just wondering about the what can we said before about having like some hidden control so it coming out a casing
and then it designing only
designing only use

so i think that should be a priority here
a lot zapping meeting because the channels a lot there you
way so it perhaps our logo on the bottom or were for you feel like it was good

eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy current remote controls
current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user
the eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy mean that

right so might be very appealing of we have very concise buttons and another thing with
i agree with if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into
my third you'd still there

but the relevance of that button is nine and ten so people want gotta
so most people feel about that
i think a benign though if i can use

then so that bad and our users found was that ten of ten i dunno
as much as channel selection but still significant
and especially if we are trying to be trendy go with fashions things like that ages

so like a running banner underneath
and you have page numbers like for the menu and
but very basic and that sort of

you happy you have no objection back with it you know like that i can send
interestingly enough twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount that would are willing to pay extra so i we're
so in may be too complicated for us but something to keep in mind anyway

and something that like for the complicate is that the t. v. makes was itself or if you
design we want to know people want their home every
want their home every remote control looks the same so

and finally my personal preferences and parts
parts i think a party really should be unique design
just start night

and we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five euros to spend remote control like their priorities
'cause at our remote control for all t. v.s so
but do you mean the link between the

i never
it was the m. management decision that we have a so
or over a parade just the same as the mobile phone mickey just

my starting out
right welcome back

need to do what's the remote control needs it and
so no l. c. d. no teletext and no voice recognition

on the functional side of things we found out that while from a previous meeting we decided that there's certain points do make a product unique one
for one thing because having controls with d. v. c. r. that sort of thing would really complicated design of the remote control we've decided not to include them and make it a specific just a specific television function which is

one it's the visibility in the dark which is
another pay more profitable as a team or some plastic and

also we could use and alarm so if we lost
them at all so it for example the screen that's holding something together could expand then it would force all the components that part so

press and the alarm from the handset would sound where it was hopefully in the room maybe behind
so for a framing to make this an international university universally accepted product and for

so that would work i'll
decisions so it's pretty much out of our hands at this point

so they can be he say it's o. and and called and then you change shape of them at all so
in the last

all we all know there are a result of the been limited and
medals or would we contribute another group

so that someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it and then once they contributed then that company can break down the part the parts better
were it's i mean you would make it be the product as you normally would apart from there

the end maybe use it would put and that project to the company "'cause" this product responsibility
come on the changing it so as you said we wanna durable but in that's not gonna write down then

so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us cost the company
if we looking for simplistic design if we need to decide

at the fact of these shape memory i know it is that they don't need to be manually the be constructed like you don't
like you don't have to individually and screw all the screws because of this

although i haven't come up with the final circuit get sides can would
a single function remote control is some place to use but it means you have to have all their remote controls for older and chi minh devices

escape or is it
function f. eight

is that a function eight
so all the remote controls must have our incorporate our logo and colour in some way so

in this case it's a function of remote control which is to send messages to the television set
set i taking inspiration from although similar designed built rank up with a directional trendy remote control which is celp or international they're

i'm probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with our a wider range of devices
does anyone have any question

i think i agree with the signal design thing for now because
so we need to decide like it's texting or something

so that it's something that fits in the household
so this something that people care but it's not it's not ignore in the household five

as for signing up and train on television set channel
so the other might be able to a lotta gadgety for some people

we interviewed remote controls are often lost somewhere so those are discuss
remote controls are bad for r. s. i.

you know people know what to do very quickly
i mean we don't have the recesses or possibility of using the internet with the remote control but

repetitive strain injury
prepared

i'm guessing that so it's not
be like the alternate remote

although we tend to be when you're watching television but
it could be very difficult to get the specific design

if we need to decide if that is are intention is to stick design
and that was sort of negate the whole remote control thing because of people can activate

so i mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us not
or like an alarm clock you have an l. c.

but if we wanna make fifty million and have everyone want this remote control we should maybe
stick to the basics

our company buy another thing is that
is going to be i'm just gonna look at my notes for a second we have

of logo what colour so if i could be some more on the design so we can be recognisable
and spray are in yellow

r. yellow thing be
so now we need to discuss and come to a decision on our remote control functions of have is going to be i'm just gonna

if i can use as it's not much but if it was on your t. v. you ought to be able to use it if
but it wouldn't it probably wouldn't be able to use would be what

i don't know but other countries besides the u. k. i. d. know
besides the u. k. i. d. know if anywhere else has it

i think we should definitely go ahead with you i was just an idea that you know "'cause"
that you know "'cause" i'm that could be as in expensive because we could use the same kind of infrared

noise is not that expensive to do
the button all

mickey just a proposal so
i like that idea

right welcome back from to the second meeting and sam

and sam i'll be happy to have the last thirty minutes

and sanitation minutes on

the needed it's

about this guy is

i'll take this time just to apologise i wouldn't

i wouldn't he receive my emails later on "'cause" i was too busy carry do it in their mind thing which is

mind thing which is all seen already could probably a teamworking think that

needs it and it meets the i'll a person to have a portable does that device so they can control the television from wherever they are they don't need to

they are they don't need to actually manually touch the television set so it

so it gives them much more flexibility in love them to be where they want to be

so we need to think about how we could bring this in technically know we could use it only related

for that for many l. also matically lights up at first touch all

touch all we could use fluorescent materials which

materials which would just i'm taking the light during the day in and as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark

so if we lost be remote control perhaps the could be a bus and on the television set itself which you can press and

i another thing i think we may styles on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of a design

from previous researchers have hard on some other projects with leds about smart materials flat specific how ease of medals have a shape memories so they can be he say

so the benefits of this a product to be that when it came c. n. do this product like if it was heated so everything with spring apart so all

so all the individual components could be easily separated and some could be we used some could be recycled and i think that be

been limited and have to be very environmentally conscious

right one question of this

of this sounds a construct a ball metal it allows for recycling materials so that

heard of that and then i do we use "'em" bits and

you could we could probably m. i. employee aside company or something to do that for as they would be a responsibility

they would be a responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made for certain percentage at

for certain percentage at least not have we

the sounds like a really great idea one thing we have

alright also have to investigate the financial implications

approach i have to see if that can meet our financial goals as

components is will be how with the wheel actually work let's have

like a very go back

buzzer

it's it would actually the circuit diagram although

battery like rechargeable probably

function

and the single function remote control you specifically for the television

i will make an array shows time or obtainable as we have less function on the side of things to include in the design another

so be cheaper to make i'm probably

it's just that one we're creating that we and we have to make at compatible with different brands of devices and it

d. v. d.s and these

does everyone agree with this does anyone

agree with this does anyone object and find be multifunctional might be a better way to go

casing that would probably and wall what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design as as

and with this will have more room in the project folder to make a more original design we'll have more money

so i'll be discussing be functional requirements of this remote control

so what are we talking when i was equivalent for remote control

so what needs and desires are to be for felt

i've done some marketing research lot of interviews with remote control users and some internet research i'm not you my

i'm not you my findings

and first i want to remind you about our company motto on purpose so we believe in

we should be looking towards trends in both closing in interior design any trends

any trends that are going on in the public even be the you know who's famous

seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly which is a quite a significant

which is a quite a significant number the other twenty

the other twenty five percent didn't specify the feel of them are fun and you know neutral eighty percent of users

the wheely the willing to spend money on a remote control personality as opposed to a basic

as opposed to a basic you know of all black all same size but in remote control so this

that was interesting

that's fine with channel changers that a lot of the numbers game rub down if they're printed on the button

television set channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour that's a huge

about this is the most important but in

it's obvious in commercials come on the changing it so

very basic and tonight but you

but you have you happy you

it's just information that on like television timetables what's on now what's on that on every channel one

an hour and as about high relevance a six point five to looks like something that we're gonna

channel settings three or point zero one times an hour relevance of three channel settings

and at the very start you know to get a new t. v. set each and all the time she's

it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control so it

control so it should be very user-friendly you know people know what

designers can look into that

bubble have to also avoid you know parents responded to the slightest touches that's a problem

so i'll show you some numbers here

so the youngest age group fifteen to twenty five ninety one point

you could see the number decreases that's with all its interestingly enough twenty

and if we have the budget for it

that ages like from thirty five to sixty five or shall or numbers probably won't be as concerned

so that's a whole other field of research i dunno

because if it is than i think for is voice activated

i'm i dunno an l. c. d. screen is

just a screen like a computer screen so or like

clock you have an l. c. d. verses just normal clock

it that it would be good if it had that to programme that was on the what was next that would probably

like getting thing with the teletext also so like

i that's something we cannot take back to respect the research and

same so in my can eat it should be user friendly and unique so the

i myself voice recognition kind of scares me off so for a framing

market i mean if we want to concentrate on fifteen or twenty five else we could go with the fancy but if we wanna make fifty

like their priorities might not be offencive remote control when they're just start night

early twenties it's kinda it's good

and if one of the largest power or most complain about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use remote control i'm that

i'm that something like an l. c. d. screen or a remote control would be that furthering that problem

complicated "'cause" i think the

before we go into more discussion on what we want this design to look like i have to see some information from the management that will fact some of our decisions

for many reasons so

so that decision sort of meet four is another

is another thing that might say affect other decisions is that the management feels that teletext is outdated because more people using the internet now and so

and so we want concern ourselves with navigating the teletext option

the idea of looking at the kinetic right now

where they was the management suggesting use of the internet about the teletext so just avoiding both altogether

but they would just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used

right and another thing this for

another thing this for the design of the product is that we wanna create more sense that people know that this is from our company so

it doesn't have to be the colour of our our company buy

we are you have one bite for the purposes of this meeting i wasn't offered a like a type of logo what colour so

it'll be one have teletext but

but you know we should discuss some those other options that you product genevieve

but another thing is that if we're reaching international crowd i know for one that in north america there is no such thing as teletext would be really superfluous

more research on i don't think that's if

so i we looking at something rather simple

the same signalling i mean

which should be able to you have the little device anywhere you "'cause" at

if the button was actually on

'cause that i will it be applicable to one t. v. set so we need to decide

maybe selling adhesive

an essay could be

that and us some way it could have some universal connection to like the stock at the same socket that the t. v.s supplied from i mean
