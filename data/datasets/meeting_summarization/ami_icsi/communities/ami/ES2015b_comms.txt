so if we lost be remote control perhaps the could be a bus and on the television set itself which you can press and
the remote control so we are you know that it'll just be for the television it'll be one have

so what are we talking when i was equivalent for remote control
watched to influence remote control
remote controls are bad for r. s. i.
but if we wanna make fifty million and have everyone want this remote control we should maybe
i'm that something like an l. c. d. screen or a remote control would be that furthering that problem
i mean we don't have the recesses or possibility of using the internet with the remote control but
so all the remote controls must have our incorporate our logo and colour in some way so
'cause at our remote control for all t. v.s so
i was gonna draw out there that thought about personalising the remote control

so those are what we look construct of the remote of the
eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy current remote controls
the eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy mean that
would look fancy mean that they would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control
to looks like something that we're gonna wanna do some research on in include on our remote control channel
want their home every remote control looks the same so

so i was looking at how are we gonna go about the working design and what
designers can look into that
design we want to know people want their home every

in this case it's a function of remote control which is to send messages to the television set
a multifunctional remote control which can be used for several entertainment devices and the single function
and the single function remote control you specifically for the television
a single function remote control is some place to use but it means you have to have all their remote controls for older and chi minh devices
i think that a single function remote control would be preferable because it's
so i'll be discussing be functional requirements of this remote control
for one thing because having controls with d. v. c. r. that sort of thing would really complicated design of the remote control we've decided not to include them and make it a specific just a specific television function which is
we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control so

need to do what's the remote control needs it and
needs it and it meets the i'll a person to have a portable does that device so they can control the television from wherever they are they don't need to
they are they don't need to actually manually touch the television set so it
so now we need to discuss and come to a decision on our remote control functions of have is going to be i'm just gonna

so people want gotta turn on the t. v. with the remote control
and that was sort of negate the whole remote control thing because of people can activate
of people can activate the television with their voice and they will be using them they will be talking it remote i'm

a single function just a television itself
so as far as we know a single function television remote control is usable internationally

be like the alternate remote
making more complicated but it could increase the popularity of the remote
and then that would be more profitable like as a sideline to the remote to sell you

set i taking inspiration from although similar designed built rank up with a directional trendy remote control which is celp or international they're
it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control so it
and if one of the largest power or most complain about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use remote control i'm that

i've done some marketing research lot of interviews with remote control users and some internet research i'm not you my
biggest frustrations of the people that we interviewed remote
we interviewed remote controls are often lost somewhere so those are discuss

would be what is the same reception on the remote control i but the actual device would have to have its own infra-red signal or

current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user

multi function controls can be difficult to use as a lot shape of buttons can be confusing

the wheely the willing to spend money on a remote control personality as opposed to a basic
as opposed to a basic you know of all black all same size but in remote control so this
