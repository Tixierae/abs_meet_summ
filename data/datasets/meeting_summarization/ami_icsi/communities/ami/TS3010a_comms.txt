so we'll get back on that first
can print it no
and have to use the pen and there are

then the rest they're going to win
they're going to win have to make a new

and we have only trendy of twelve and a half euro to make it
now i have to think about what will make first

and if you push button the led gives it lights and you see that it's working
no but i am i in my experience is that it's convenient to have to

opening then the rest

has to be original trendy and user-friendly so

first we have to make a functional design of that we have to make

of that we have to make a conceptual design and

and after that the detailed design so we'll discuss

so we'll discuss that later

first we have a look at that string

that string for still we have to make a small training but do we

but do we have to do first

first you can save to documents have to do that

you have to make your own favourite animal so

so i'll make an example first

first don't touch that things

you can change some things

for what line and change it

and you can change the colour

and a half and

so and after that you have to save it now we can

now we can make a new one you

you have to pay know so

how far from

one big one

one big one they are and not easy to use and

and i have one side and remote control one i drop it

have sound that won't be our goal i think and

and a big buttons and it's

not all small buttons you don't know

it's just poster for negative that they're big presents

big buttons bus this all small buttons

all small buttons like when you have like a hundred buttons on your remote control you won't know what they're working for

your experience

your experience

i think they're the goal of a remote control is that it's it has an influence on the t. v. set and the control to

and the control to channels and the volume and

and i think it's positive if there's a led a light on the corner of the remote so that

so that you know it's still as batteries on it's in it and if

it's easy to you

think we have four distinctive remote control for that's not really
