so this is a first meeting of this design project
can we want to practice using some of the tools that will be using doing the course of the design project in the meetings specifically
and the interface design in this project and

and then the detailed design will come after we
the detailed design i
detailed design i it will again be the identification of the components are holding it could be chip

and similarly with the conceptual design we'll
i'm a bit confused about the what's the difference between the functional design conceptual design
has to do the conceptual design is perhaps be given that as an includes the
i think it's in the conceptual design phase out there and the it's
it's in the conceptual design phase that the identify of the components of our product

of it i think it needs for like that it's gonna work
so if you're kinda sad case the nays higher may control works then you need that's fine then you can do on the

i think that we talking that the functional design is more you all are area of things way you will be we
i think we'll start that initially with the functional design already been
i'm gonna be doing to be according to the middle on the computer does everything the user requirements specification for the functional design trendwatching in the conceptual design and put it to charge evaluation in the detailed design it's

is it just more detail lands on it
and then in the last state just i would be responsible for being in for it for the user interface design
so i'm supposed to design all the details off the product how
so that's something to keep in mind when you designing
because you have no idea how to get mean that the designers not

does may need to have buttons on it to do that maybe to do
it could be one button for a menu or something if you really need to go and do that

that looks like a dog
it looks very key it's
made a nine i put down some like inspirational words like that i got from looking at the pictures say the mouse say
it looks really pretty to you
for them you're looking at the working design
you're looking at the technical functions design

then we need to go through these specifics of am project plan and
probably think and blue but you need
then in the in the conceptual design this day each are in need to come up was interface concept and then
so to do that fine and some people estimate that we need production costs of the maximum twelve and a half euro so that we can write that profit at that
are could have need you need to me
and it's like i mean you need theoretically you could you all kinds of things and you t. v. right but what the most
and in a battery like every now and then you need to the place of the trees
so we need to wrap it up now so that we can go away
back again do we need to unplug think it's probably

what we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for television
there is the functional design of the the remote control we're going
we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what
roles so and in the different stages of the design so at first i would responsible for for it in designing the technical functions of on the remote control
how important know like yellow control colour
does anyone have any a first ideas to bounce around about what we thinking of this remote control
i'm just wondering what that was that there is like any special feature that we want to have "'em" want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones
with this but if we all have a think when we go away from the meeting what specific things could be included in this remote control that a rash of the ordinary
although i don't think that the it's a huge problem for remote controls and in a battery like

we're planning to sell these remote controls for its
we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five euros each

so that's just a brief overview of the project itself
we'll discuss today was that was my role in the project is hard to say
to say i hope to be loyal to the project and
the project and not not so and left people are doing similar project know the details or project or something i'm from a seven year
my and my role in the project is a the industrial designer so
and i'm your project manager for today and my
so this is the overall budget for project we've got

and i am like to show you the agenda for the meeting i don't know if it was saying
this is the plan for today's meeting is
and then come together for meetings to work on that

the method that we going to use to complete the project that has three components as such there is
we do we identify the components of our our product i think
what are the various functions that we were performed by it and doing the conceptual design or the release components
or the release components of it and
and make that you all work together in a production price of that by the end of the day we come up with a great product

we'll start off by working individually it but their own expertise on our laptops in a more bring
in a more bring what we've done together
how it works and whatever so and you during the functional role what are the various functions
