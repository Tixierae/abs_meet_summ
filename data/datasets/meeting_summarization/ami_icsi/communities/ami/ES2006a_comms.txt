so this is a first meeting of this design project
what we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for television
the way we would do that i think is to work individually initially and then come together
in a more bring what we've done together
we called altogether
i'm a bit confused about the what's the difference between the functional design conceptual design
is it just more detail lands on it
things falling into a wide
all ties always within that right
stuart
i like sports or a picks kick boxing spinning
that looks like a dog

each person into then i'd like us to go up to the white board that panes just
that panes just underneath it there and
or the release components of it and
the detailed design i
right now it's my turn
just like a cult i think

then we need to go through these specifics of am project plan and
and discuss come up with some
what favourite animal is that how important know like
know so let them draw the body for
don't like snakes i

not at this point
and similarly with the conceptual design we'll
i think that we talking that the functional design is more you all are area of things way you will be we
come from a stranger we have nasty snakes it's from
it's from last year i'm from

not at this point
this is our project what
so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product
and i like it because it's small and it's left a
and the drawings to

i looking at me
right it's a fluffy where do you probably think and blue
as compared to small
i like dogs to it but i
to it but i do that are ready because

you put them pockets
i'm from last second
of it i think it needs for like that it's gonna work
then in the in the conceptual design this day each are in need to come up was interface concept and then
it also holds

come up with some preliminary ideas about it
we'll start off by working individually it but their own expertise on our laptops in a more bring
we don't would be really skinny legs and the what
and the what a long tail and the whole

so we do we identify
this is a rabbit
not with our bits then you know and that's
and and i like what else especially think want

say my name's cats and i mean you know
and the whole face
i hope we don't like snakes to
so let's see what's next in the powerpoint presentation

i didn't receive it
although i'm you've actually got some of the information already but in the main purpose
and what specific things that it has to do the

can we want to practice using some of the tools that will be using doing the course of the design project in the meetings specifically
i'm gonna be doing to be according to the middle on the computer does everything the user requirements specification for the functional design trendwatching in the conceptual design and put it to charge evaluation in the detailed design it's
on a favourite

the method that we going to use to complete the project that has three components as such there is
maybe i should have shouldn't have said it beforehand
maybe it has some of the patches

what i'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and stop using some of the tools that we using for the project specifically
alright can make it smaller set an
set an and the interface

specifically the whiteboard
and one you doing the ash tell us your name what your role is and perhaps how you are animal would like to the road you're taking in this project
either of the features

and draw your favourite animal and then
excellent what's it what's your role within that in
alright be and in the middle

so my name is mark r. s.
if you didn't have much enough for "'em" that so anyway sit there and you can wrap
there and you can wrap it off

i'm from a seven year
have alright my roles
roles so and in the different stages of the design so at first i would responsible for for it in designing the technical functions of on the remote control

on a favourite animal what favourite animal
how important know like yellow control colour
what are the various functions that we were performed by it and doing the conceptual design or the release components

and i am like to show you the agenda for the meeting i don't know if it was saying
i don't know if it was saying round to it

this is the plan for today's meeting is
is faceplate us to introduce the project briefly although

but in the main purpose is to say that we get to know each other a little bit more
has to do the conceptual design is perhaps be given that as an includes the

it's so we've got twenty five minutes to do that's and
it is like a euro

you don't have to hurry we've got plenty of time
but not with a rabbit

and i mean you know very good at this whole going malarkey say
good point

it at first i thought it was going to be cat
ha

top and the key
of animals but i do like dogs maybe i should

i'm the marketing expert say
and then in the last state just i would be responsible for being in for it for the user interface design

and i do like dogs because they are good friends two people and they
two people and they e. l.

very much more fun because they are not so in the pen
and where i was living in cambodia they used to live in my house and i were

they just keep sitting there eating grass to do not this tell
on the ceiling and that would make a lot quicker noises in the evening

detailed design i it will again be the identification of the components are holding it could be chip
i'm from india

doing i. p. h. d. in like linguistics i said at the department
i said at the department psychology

i like we can i'm jane
i'm jane

norway a
is the different

specifically the whiteboard then we

to do that's and channel eleven twenty five

so any questions

we want it to be something original something trendy and also something user-friendly so it has

there is the functional design of the the remote control we're going

and then come together for meetings to work on that

and then the detailed design will come after we

we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what

as an includes the how people are going to use the sand and that kind of thing

how it will be done

we do we identify the components of our our product i think

i think it's in the conceptual design phase out there and the it's

it's in the conceptual design phase that the identify of the components of our product

i think we'll start that initially with the functional design already been

so that's just a brief overview of the project itself

so it each person into

and then tell everyone what your favourite characteristics of that animal are and one you doing

would you like to go first

a wide

put them pockets

i thought it might be a cat to

and i know ions and

i can see but ideas

probably think and blue but you need

and one day you be able to just keep genetically modified and i will come in think

and in the middle

or top and the

second

to match the rabbit

alright can make it smaller

and the interface design in this project and

and my favourite animal i'm i mean

i'm i mean i'm not so because i'm not so very familiar with all kinds of animals but i

there are different kinds of talks

isn't there were press a number of it i think it

the rubber legs are on the other side

as compared to small animals like cats very

maybe the fact that they protect their homes

we'll discuss today was that was my role in the project is hard to say

to say i hope to be loyal to the project and

the project and not not so and left people are doing similar project know the details or project or something i'm from a seven year

my name is colour of

good luck

you know just like a big round body and then

round body and then somebody skinny legs and then just simple

i don't know so let

and then just simple ones

it's leading

and there is some grass there so this is what i like

horns it also holds

to do not this tell anybody they're

they're kind of put this to know where so

my and my role in the project is a the industrial designer so

so i'm supposed to design all the details off the product how

how it works and

how it works and whatever so and you during the functional role what are the various functions

and finally i'm not about was

i'm not about was the last part

he's a space

it looks very key it's

do that are ready because contra broke as as u. k. and i

is it at they also like lizards or are they

that's a kind of lizard and

and i like it "'cause" because they remind

'cause because they remind me of warm places and

my house and i were on the ceiling and that

i hope we don't

don't like snakes i come from a stranger

and i'm your project manager for today and my

and my role is to keep things going and make

and make that you all work together in a production price of that by the end of the day we come up with a great product
