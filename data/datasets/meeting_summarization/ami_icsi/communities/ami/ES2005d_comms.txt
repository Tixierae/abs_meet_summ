we made three for you
so that would take away three u. which would give us
so these are the three great a good idea but evaluation of our product has
so we actually know a preference for a particular fruits two or three kinds that
two or three kinds that and
three or four now
that the three or four much or three
three go for three
we are getting two point three something what we can round

shift button maybe start again
no that's "'cause" the shift button so
did you try both shift buttons it could be that so

so now is the final evaluation line in additional do all of our product how we
not only in terms of providing quality products not only incorporating latest technology is but also in terms of writing in my mind turns
what does it in terms of providing environment that's a product
believe that because whatever companies a lot of their products in the shape of fruits to give a range of products so they of shaped like
there's also like that it will be fashionable to have these products in be a as a fruit shape or something
so and in this a product is good and the second
our product me steve to face or terms of the market and
so i think overall a violation of our product is quite good so

are just rubber to your we are using the scroll buttons like this is the new ideas
because of the pushbuttons and the scroll buttons

this do it gives did it into this product based on the user requirements whether it meets the user requirements or not this product and end times
so we will see whether this product miss all the user requirements or not i were first
save so says our product we use all these requirements i would also prefer to be rate rank one is

so this is a in a know type non at the buttons one was in a few buttons
was in a few buttons as possible mainly speak recognition
so the buttons would be like you know individual users or
we used to there's a tool that later that and then that big a button in the middle is the on and off one it's not in the traditional
that's one of the buttons a stick and i don't know what it's
but i there's kinda shortage of buttons

the user look i think
has comes user requirement so
ever use or do you think that they were yours or user requirements or not
and the user requirement is essentially just to operate a t. v. so
basic requirements part of the pro of the project

or whether it can be so standards or not we're trading
we're trading we will give you these products so of course this
what we do that i have to decide what we're trading we will give you this product and everything so
so we're trading you are personally seven

so in order to say even are two euros i was thinking that we could have a sense of the same shape but just have a flat and
i mean it's already got kind of shape to buy wouldn't have
i don't like that counts as a curve over that's just a shape
is the new ideas are then new shapes everything had a little
they of shaped like a way see look at this as think of is to operate a given radio different things some to do like the way
some to do like the way banana shape so my project somebody one pineapple shape some more a shape so you can
quite good like they supporters i mean fruit shape because that's where

but also we gonna have the company name on the front which is a little black kind of a line in the middle so it and
that marketing strategy of the company has we already
has we already discussed that our company is quite rare bird in the market not only in
so what company strategy
say i'd give the company strategy two
i think it's the remote control conforms to the company strategy is that the question
pretty much kept the company strategy so i would go for a one as we know only get to it but we were limited by
we also like this product me a a we and this may so companies to take like

when about putting them that because it's a kind of could get bashed
then the buttons kind of
just general phones up for all those on that kind of
that kind of on forcibly is too quick at
we've got a job made out of kind of a rubbery teletext new material that we've got i

we can work around
we can work around that
should we ask what they can work many so
no it's fine we've worked that or
so but material d. a. will tell you can work this is we're going to discuss all this do
the board working again
do you have the the marker work
of course we haven't actually got working model
and where do you say where investors it's working

and it powered one is what to the that is not of a fruit look but if the
because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at the like school you know so
and sort of pretty that just the fruit
maybe trendy to some i'm just not small and the fruit so

that the technology me is the requirements of the customers or not
it maybe having good design it may be a meeting all the requirements of the customers like it technology wise price for it but there's one thing
but there's one thing we its limits the customers like we having
but if the parts and then like a banana out all and you are limiting you know don't
will like so in this case giving only one or two traces we are leaving limiting all customers and by limiting them
and by limiting them the olympic i would say the same thing over profit also
to take like a product should be as customers requirement as but let us technology and it should be wiring to save so

or you where you're holding it kind of
if you hold it you can walk hold it is it does actually
hold on to find a shift button
