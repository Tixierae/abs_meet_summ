to do when you guys first lady prototype probably get that it is
just let a lie down once then
right so let's find answers so i
i think we have a one product
issue
i think were very creative
like that we discussed the only new ideas but of course
but of course we could only eat any proper goes a week or they use these are just rubber
i don't know what it says but it's completely from the end
have you financed
you go presentation
it didn't bother to tell me that on this thing
wonder what so
it's fun to touch
we're trading we will give you these products so of course this
i were first i would like to have you ever use or do you
ever use or do you think that they were yours or user requirements or not

feature also like to see
just hear your shoulder
maybe shrink and said can i can see
we made three for you
three
until want to match i
that's already got it stands that one that's it
stand it does it also a life that
that that you get this and they represents the charging stand
so are there any improvement so it's see it so
other issues
we have to really of action
of action and highlighted somewhere
i mean it's already got kind of shape to buy wouldn't have
that's so project

scale model
that's a speaker at the top so you can
so you can speak into that like little ball to talk it's speak quite mission
then the buttons kind of
kind of that country just buttons whatever you need them try to keep it
them try to keep it simple that's
simple that's the charging base prongs of the boss but we used to there's a
we used to there's a tool that later that and then that big a button in the middle is the on and off one it's not in the traditional
it's not in the traditional place but
but it's quite obvious place
it's the way as as possible
there again and i and we have the non this one two
this one is i suppose for the younger audiences
just general phones up for all those on that kind of

on an option about that
a pixel just
all sort of loch ness banana
so in order to say even are two euros i was thinking that we could have a sense of the same shape but just have a flat and
more like a traditional
like just got a single curve on that all have and the double curved would be if it was that someone curve out which i'm at the wrong
this will then move it would be all these
we were trying to save
so let's talk about are bonuses and the races really isn't so
so now we have to do it on a board

that's one of the buttons a stick and i don't know what it's
don't know where what do you reckon we could and
if we happy with designers they points any money if we don't have t. but if there's anything
but if there's anything you think we've raised out and then i feel free to have it maybe
because it's not an ideal place right now
so project evaluation we have on the crap
leadership
the technical was brilliant i but
but apply more

very fine
keys is that we're now
were trying to save money so
i mean would be bigger so we might be more space for the slogan on the front because
so this is very important factor for evaluation notes of that marketing
so these are the three great a good idea but evaluation of our product has
it had all the basic buttons that they needed as as the and new technology that people said they wanted

but mainly is speech recognition
so the buttons would be like you know individual users or
but also we gonna have the company name on the front which is a little black kind of a line in the middle so it and
cut things that
it's meant to be one i dunno wanted
i dunno wanted to in there but
now comes the criteria meeting with seven point scale and having this

and i don't know what new ideas found it means to be honest
is the new ideas are then new shapes everything had a little
agreement on the know
we've got a job made out of kind of a rubbery teletext new material that we've got i
so of course this a little bit teamwork what we do that
what we do that i have to decide what we're trading we will give you this product and everything so
this do it gives did it into this product based on the user requirements whether it meets the user requirements or not this product and end times

that's groovy
answers so i don't know where what
i suppose those are that's our design that we've got so
project process everything that went
no i mean i think it means sort of individually

have your presentation to make no
no just hear
one space other than no one space and that's marked it on the other one
clear

an obvious if it's
if it's standing up i
be an could have to be a bit big
that's sort of curve and then i

so some party the banana
right it's too induce more television watching this poster
the you know we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons and it's gonna cost is for doing point six euros
what's on the on the left

the curvature rest like there is case
'cause that's the the biggest expense we had to
and what why have gonna to know a constant to select
we can work around that

you can do one thing that and then you just select one box
you just select one box also
also this will then move
have on the crap out here is fifty project

should we ask what they can work many so
and having this year this scale so
the user look i think
do you have the the marker work

doesn't save as quite as much
what why is the a double curved two of them
you start cleaning up the clay

curved this is double
this is double curve in this one
curve in this one is single curve

single curved is it on both sides
i'm at the wrong
like this one for one decide on that and that's it

we've worked that or it would be anyway
did you try both shift buttons it could be that so
has we already discussed that our company is quite rare bird in the market not only in

was in a few buttons as possible mainly speak recognition
mainly speak recognition that they would that

the slave again but we need to incorporate
that should buttons

more like a traditional remote control
and means the technical

so that would take away three u. which would give us
see if it has to be thing or ups

not only in terms of providing quality products not only incorporating latest technology is but also in terms of writing in my mind turns
what does it in terms of providing environment that's a product

now what stories

what stories the powerpoint i i was that was a phone

i was that was a phone

a wall or forgotten familiar the minutes but i will

the minutes but i will do that's the easy

that's the easy

that's good news

we have budget problems

i we have to match left and so

so this is a in a know type non at the buttons one was in a few buttons

but we need to incorporate very simple

very simple if you do need buttons

if you do need buttons you can flip the redness there

all that you have a my project things and screen which you can do on on

that and the best one is one or more like a ball that we that to add a day you

day you guys can have like a

i like the feel of it like if you're right

brilliant

the lack on the back is this like an

you have a standing up it's on that but

right brent like that from the centre

so it and that's be transmit d. v. d. thing these are just

thing these are just to scroll once we still could be channel up and down and volume up and down when

when about putting them that because it's a kind of could get bashed

or you where you're holding it kind of

if you hold it you

if you hold it you can walk hold it is it does actually

it is it does actually feel quite economic if you

if you got small hands so i see

see i don't mean that's real size to be an could have to be a

a more friendly type of

so some party

a to have options least

a lie down once then

and main problem that we have one for sleep being the finance

this is entering the evaluation criteria

to buy wouldn't have to be curved sort of an act and

good point

and double curve on both sides

this is double curved

as a single curved is it on

i think it means double curved as in like

like an ashtray

i don't like that counts as a curve over that's just a shape

a constant to select any more rubber

we can work around

to in there but hold on to find a

hold on to find a shift button

shift button maybe start again

eleven or other euros sixty

so we came out so

to know not quite have the scroll wheel and functionally one

should find the accountants

by the accountants

we could add things

if you click back and that bottom right so we're starting from when you see arrow keys is that we're

no it just extends as i don't

no that's "'cause" the shift button so

is it the other shows but maybe

should we ask maybe it should we ask what they

no it's fine we've worked that or

we're on the road

i think it went quite it's

room for creativity we had with that

teamwork

teamwork leadership

great leadership

my chair or get you're getting a risk that teamwork

that teamwork i thought

that phone call and ask them to i think

apply more to have a right and i

these pens or a neat though

i'd be the new ideas like glow in the dark or something like that we discussed

are just rubber to your we are using the scroll buttons like this is the new ideas

and they're really so just general phones

that kind of on forcibly is too quick at

at i suppose

it's a having another couple of days holiday pay maybe in order for all of a

does it go back and the reusable

something we should fix

and that's my news for the presentation

hm is the project evaluated that is mine

it doesn't tell me

you intend and

talk to you that no fire agreement on

click or banana

israelis you have that

so now is the final evaluation line in additional do all of our product how we

are going to me as a quite standard word standard or whether it can

or whether it can be so standards or not we're trading

so but material d. a. will tell you can work this is we're going to discuss all this do

and end times leds as but if a latest fashion trend somewhat means

means hand because we already stated that people do graph of fashionable things nowadays so

that marketing strategy of the company has we already

like keeping it keeping in mind all the safety issues so

the board working again

has comes user requirement so

so we will see whether this product miss all the user requirements or not i were first

and the user requirement is essentially just to operate a t. v. so

so we're trading you are personally seven
