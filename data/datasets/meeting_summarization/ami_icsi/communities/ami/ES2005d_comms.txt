we made three for you
so that would take away three u. which would give us
so these are the three great a good idea but evaluation of our product has
so we actually know a preference for a particular fruits two or three kinds that
two or three kinds that and
three go for three
we are getting two point three something what we can round

hold on to find a shift button
shift button maybe start again
no that's "'cause" the shift button so

three or four now
that the three or four much or three
a four i give it a middle the road for

this do it gives did it into this product based on the user requirements whether it meets the user requirements or not this product and end times
the user look i think
has comes user requirement so
so we will see whether this product miss all the user requirements or not i were first
ever use or do you think that they were yours or user requirements or not
and the user requirement is essentially just to operate a t. v. so

believe that because whatever companies a lot of their products in the shape of fruits to give a range of products so they of shaped like
there's also like that it will be fashionable to have these products in be a as a fruit shape or something
and sort of pretty that just the fruit
maybe trendy to some i'm just not small and the fruit so
quite good like they supporters i mean fruit shape because that's where
at our fair share data shows that people like everything else everything that is being advertised like those shows and everything is being able to it in the form of fruit and veggie they were all getting them "'cause" some as it is or showing some association with that so

no it's fine we've worked that or
from a personally it is everything fine it maybe

so this is a in a know type non at the buttons one was in a few buttons
was in a few buttons as possible mainly speak recognition
if you do need buttons you can flip the redness there
we used to there's a tool that later that and then that big a button in the middle is the on and off one it's not in the traditional
that's one of the buttons a stick and i don't know what it's
it had all the basic buttons that they needed as as the and new technology that people said they wanted
but i there's kinda shortage of buttons
there are in mind that the specifications are we had to frame vegetables are quite popular and that people like something that is good to look at it and not many buttons are i would give it's because

when about putting them that because it's a kind of could get bashed
or you where you're holding it kind of
then the buttons kind of
i mean it's already got kind of shape to buy wouldn't have
that kind of on forcibly is too quick at
we've got a job made out of kind of a rubbery teletext new material that we've got i

so the buttons would be like you know individual users or
now comes the criteria meeting with seven point scale and having this
basic requirements part of the pro of the project
save so says our product we use all these requirements i would also prefer to be rate rank one is

but also we gonna have the company name on the front which is a little black kind of a line in the middle so it and
that marketing strategy of the company has we already
has we already discussed that our company is quite rare bird in the market not only in
that's i think in a if you going to buy t. v. maybe the company all have the you can choose from a company on have two or three trace it is but the different designs we'll come up with one
so what company strategy
say i'd give the company strategy two
i think it's the remote control conforms to the company strategy is that the question
pretty much kept the company strategy so i would go for a one as we know only get to it but we were limited by
we also like this product me a a we and this may so companies to take like

and it powered one is what to the that is not of a fruit look but if the
because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at the like school you know so

radio can give your be used his own technology that the
that the technology me is the requirements of the customers or not
it maybe having good design it may be a meeting all the requirements of the customers like it technology wise price for it but there's one thing
as far as the other technology it's got the latest trends in speech technology
technology but it's missing the screen and you said
to take like a product should be as customers requirement as but let us technology and it should be wiring to save so

so in order to say even are two euros i was thinking that we could have a sense of the same shape but just have a flat and
i don't like that counts as a curve over that's just a shape
is the new ideas are then new shapes everything had a little
they of shaped like a way see look at this as think of is to operate a given radio different things some to do like the way
some to do like the way banana shape so my project somebody one pineapple shape some more a shape so you can

not only in terms of providing quality products not only incorporating latest technology is but also in terms of writing in my mind turns
what does it in terms of providing environment that's a product
per se i didn't i think that in terms of times is where it's quite good like
our product me steve to face or terms of the market and
so i think overall a violation of our product is quite good so

we can work around
we can work around that
should we ask what they can work many so
so but material d. a. will tell you can work this is we're going to discuss all this do
the board working again
do you have the the marker work
of course we haven't actually got working model
and where do you say where investors it's working
