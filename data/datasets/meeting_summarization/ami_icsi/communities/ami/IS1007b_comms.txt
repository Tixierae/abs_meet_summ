and you mean t. v. a decision on t. v. design and for that you see the remote control and
so he remote control should be want to use it for you to be feature
so what type thing i from now is it were you we don't want to have remote control we which is wide so
so this is the ski mask off i if i a lot of the future remote controls so
we have to say that it's the t. v. you think with the remote control
because i use a remote control
so the person on the remote controller so you can
it is interesting but we only cost a movie remote control
so if we already have it in our remote control

at found that the function of remote control is to send messages to television set for example
from the technical aspect the processing should be done on the t. v. set them on the on the remote controller right and then
and we can try to get this information onto the remote control to do the processing on the remote control because
or is done the at this remote control

i'll borrow a remote we don't want to make a
harvey each this remote
and adding up the speech interface is always good for a t. v. remote but
and you find it and then i would like to have them by options in german so the remote

and i will present my first idea on how to build and our new remote control for television so
so it's a good idea if you if we think about how to be that our remote control we d.s functionality know we could which would come in a few years so if we already

controls so you can see the components battery and
the main that back to this but there and the remote control the power to the battery comes to the infra-red
because see using because it is in bluetooth if some be but p. d. a. they can use the p. d. a. the control the t. v. they want to

we i we just have to find the mean how to add them microphone know yes a microphone into the the remote control so

yes the next night
so next presentation
and next one of the size of the remote control it has to be

and of course we should have our team i'm into the design
so let's start to see and the steel designer
alright so that we talk about and or working design and
right and that's it for the working design so if you have any
four let's move to use the first design
i'm working on the technical functions design
on like simple design just give them and maybe

and when we are ready with this first prototype i think we can have some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or things like that so
the alimentation then to programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication and the communication
the one on top is for the the functionality in the functionalities and the
it i think we should use the s. p. g. a. for the functionalities which is easy to
so you have to participate the future
the future demand market demands
it but to to find a way to add this functionality in i i mean in an easy manner if it's possible
the functionality in the future alright

and i think we don't need like to adapt so
so i think those are things to do is to define there are components needed to achieve what we want to do so
you can put it on a charger we know you when you don't need to use it
and we can proof it the users preference and we need
and we need something to do some pre processing from
we did we don't need really much buttons to you if we have a screen to navigate on the t. v. so
i understand i thought you agree
i thought you agree to you and if i need you just
so are you needs special t. v. sets to do that or

people don't like it to how to buy the batteries and there are now it has to make a small
it has to make a small charger and put it
it's too small not that i was so fun to go and find it
but i think it will be yes a bit complicated to make it a speech recognition in a those runs on the small and
it has to be of course very slim and small one
that you can litigate small might or maybe them so

and we have you can put a new project requirements no i think
according to the to the new requirements i think we don't need that
for our next products our new t. v. set we can automatical sound adjustment act
but what about the new project's requirement and i think

of driving the inputs from industrial design and user interface i think most of the points which i want to already covered here and
i mean it's for the industrial design and user use interface designer strip is that if it's going to be walking or not

and then we big speech recognition is very says we may just putting we make a i. d.
speech recognition
the speech and refers and the

and to find the most interesting features or the users would be interested then what we're done is there put a feedback forms in all the magazines and
clare of the of features on the cost
little bit more or if it's or text of features
of what the extra features
yes this is speech is important extra feature that i think
so i think that's a very good idea to put these features and the fourth one was
and the teletext so this this up that these are the text information which it worked on the televisions if you're
