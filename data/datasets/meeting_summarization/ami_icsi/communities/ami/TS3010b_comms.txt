we have at least my documents
working design that
for business
it's working design
check
it's a little difficult i'm gonna tell you if it's about the working
it's about the working of the remote control i just said
control work about it of it
i think i can make it a difficult but
difficult but we all don't get it
and the buttons when you used
so a lot of unused buttons it's
so you don't have to for a lot of audio options or screen of to change the brightness this is things

is the minutes from the first meeting we'll find the next
we'll find the next minutes also there
and after that we have to make decisions what we'll do and then
and then we're ready have forty minutes
my joke it's
the little later but here it is
i think we don't have that in our budget do you think

computer or
you say one battery is cheaper why
i think that cover may be made in china like it will be i so expensive i think
but i also this sign "'cause"
and fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons so
we see the same your news is

so welcome back what do they do we have
just like with the nokia a files useful
bins you're doing the marketing expert
and the stop the volume but specific that the page or the they have to wide the screen

which and connect to the components in it the battery and
we should make it too big
so if you have a trendy house little red the yellow or something and then you can put pirette cover on it and
and to come back on the the swapping things i don't think i am i think the younger will be most interesting that

them here i have the top of the remote control
my preferences it's it
i don't i'm not if it will make profit enough to but it's it's an
but it's it's an original idea

have forty minutes for this meeting a said
if we aim for the younger people and then there will be a lot of features like l. c. d. or the speech yes recognising the cost will be a lot of a lot higher
i think l. c. d. is cheaper than speech recognition so

my documents and
it much more nokia telephone send these ones
to like onto my personal preferences and that

let's say if it on my computer my presentation
what's the name of
it was about the working of the remote control

is that paying a function or the functional requirements
it because it's that so expensive
buttons use buttons find uses us very important and it's walls and how

on top of this there are the numbers you have all
but then use it i don't know what's a good thing of speech recognition
stack point that's important functions should be this kind of on the remote control modification

also for costs we should only board one battery on at a long
is i think it's easier
yes most users use it for days

and the bleeding you'll you colours but
lost it thing you push a button and then you're a bleep and we'll find it
maybe just an menu button to use it on our televisions and

much more or of more functions on the remotes maybe
i users they dislike the look and feel of current remote controls
and not important they found the audio and the stop

basic or multifunctional
that was my functional and talk
and we asked them if we add some new feature is if that would be a good idea or not

the younger group meeting station twenty five it's not very big and to come
and it you'll be very said friendly yes most
the my findings

and off that have some new project requirements so and after
then we have if you graphs about the market

a said after lunch so first
but this will this add to the costs

working this
desktop

first i'll tell you something about the findings one i discovered
one i discovered about the remote control work

with a little bit of science
we just heard from the industrial designer how difficult it is but

it the battery and and switches and things like that there's a lot of small
we used to you can use it two times longer

here some kind of chip on
also for the cost and use only plastic not

button and a here's the battery
two questions the battery you say one battery

and when you push the button it will will be sent to the chip and the chip
and the chip will send it to all kind of sub components that's what i said

not other materials also
also because of costs and not too much buttons on it we can also

no two questions the
design that would be a bitter like the use of it what

and then we make it easier for a television sitting on the other team
sitting on the other team televisions can also use it but then we

one and then you can buy the coverage
multi also zap a lot so

would you change go for it
and that's our our deal "'em" i think it

you're the people what do you think about it
but they find most remote controls very ugly so the design

i find some some interesting quite some away and the
a my mind so i didn't know what to what way we would go

or a message to the television
in the we asked them how would you like us a new feature if you have an l.

these are two remotes and that's our
if you have an l. c. d. on the remote control what would think if it's

that's the dilemma i
teletext is that sense and also important

they're specially found font and very ugly and
and all the user in k. it can get this gets change i think that they want like

it very can see what the market share it is of a shuffle good
yes can see the most users are between two a six or forty five

your news is think that's an interesting i. d. and all chooses
we found out that are out to sell four markers at which we can aim at the first

i. d. and all chooses not
age between forty six to sixty five they are less interested

but that they spend their money more easy but if we look back
but if we look back at this graph we can see that's a more diverse group is about sixty percent and said look

first i wanna say i'm the secretary so

the secretary so i make minutes you

you find them in your in the map in the from the group is the minutes from

i wanna hear from you what you've done

so first on a asked the industrial designer to tell what see it so

it's my task "'kay"

design that i've saved it

that's the end you want

presentation working design

i just said and half an hour and to study it and i

now have ten minutes to tell us

ten minutes to tell it's i

i think it will be a few minutes and first

then i'll have some kind of met and

of met and it's the top of the remote control with a little bit of

you i'll show that in a few minutes and then know

first the findings the remote control

the remote control is a very difficult things to to explain to just all of you who haven't seen a remote control inside there's a lot of

there's a lot of plastic on it

and there are a lot of four wires

there's a lot of small electronics so it

so it won't be do a expensive to build it in the twelve euro

in the twelve euro fifty i think will make it

you have all in your remote control and

control and then the teletext the button and

that's what i said it's very difficult and off

and off to that it will be sent to the infrared and

and that will send it to your television that's

that's a short how it works

on at a long lasting battery also for the cost

we can also make a button or would that work on menu of button and then

on the t. v. you can in a switch into the menu is i think

but we can also use it a bleep like something when the battery sandy then there's a bleep and you'll have to

and you'll have to change it in a week or something and also

and also the bleeper where what i told you about when you lost it thing you push

if we what if we use only use wanna small penlight then it will be cheaper now when we are still

but we used to

but then we have to make their remote control a long lasting right just

so that's the size of the remote control and

when you used on the television you if you need the television which can use it

but i think this is our remote control is for televisions we we sell in our company or is it also

or is it also for other company or for other televisions

i think we have to use it also on a that if you should show

and this is an option maybe just

that two different things so we have to

we have to choose one

it has to work on what are all televisions

then i think the menu button only work on the new with televisions

and we will look forward and don't make remote control which for the older televisions

and i just have one more idea

idea maybe it's one of the past but

but to have a trendy remote control we can also make something like a nokia mobile phones to change covers

and also different things

then it won't be we'll have to use one cover on the original one and then

yes but you have to be able to change it to do is

to change it to do is to make it more difficult to design

i think it will be a little more difficult but not too

but then we'll have to just put five colours on it and see if it works it would want works

it would want works then we'll get something else do we want

else do we want to the covered with it

that profits bigger than that goes

when you're have a remote control do you would change the cover

but maybe i think trendy people children

children when you complained on it and the

on it and the chills you that's my remote control i made a picture of

i think that too less people would change it for good profit so

it's a good idea but

your project manager

your project manager yes

so now the user interface design

yes i showed there's a short talk about the technical function design i thought

i thought the technical function design was to for remote control to have some influence on the t. v. set

both are g. o. k. v. video in a court is no courts

no courts attached and

and it all by pushing a button on the remote that was from my own

that was from my own experience and the previous meeting

and and basic operations like on and off and switching channels and that and maybe teletext or something like that

it is but show would make a basic remote control would just swapping channels and volume and the power button and nothing much more or

maybe more devices you can influence

radio or a v. of the video recorder i. v. c. r.

i any ideas about that

no but back on that later

that was just a my mind so

this bit too far

so i'm no i don't know i thought that station about markets about

about the what people think we get that

we get that usability lab test with and that person's and we looked

and we looked at us f. o. things among then

among then design

what for station the ads using remote controls

what will be a market and we

findings i

and and don't file them hard to learn how to use it multi

so setting and it should be fairly easy

it's more findings

on the buttons use

and how much to the user at the

at the most use it button is the channel selection

and we have to know elephant they think the bill starts to power

starts to power volume and channel selection very relevant teletext

the screen in the brightness and channel settings it and they also i'm not used very often then we

but the i'm not a very big group

no you can't really see you in users say it's on i what they would very and all

it and another thing how would you like to have speech recognition on it

at the first are the younger age between

age between sixteen to forty five

i'd be interested in the features that you can see here

and there are more critical on their money spending

the second group is the older age group age between forty

they are less interested in a new features but that

and said look about forty percent

so that the first will be is bigger to like onto my

and that first question is are also we have to ask you said two is mark do we aim at

of course not saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that all people won't buy it but left "'em" will

but left "'em" will buy it

but i fired even young people say it's hard to use remote control so if you

so if you make a remote control that is say we used use that's especially at that age group even the young group will also be more interested

and we can make special features but i think

but i think it looks and the first time but then

and that's my stack point

modification be at your

you can find most functions on r. t. v. sets

the design is very important one thing i

one thing i didn't say you think it's that's a lot of users also it's and i will to by a good-looking remote control if there will be want

so the design of a remote call is very important and it

i have one question if we aim for the

and i don't think twenty five euros for a remote is really cheap or something so

so it's it's hard to get the younger group
