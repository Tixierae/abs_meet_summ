it was about the working of the remote control
it's about the working of the remote control i just said
one i discovered about the remote control work

first the findings the remote control
the remote control is a very difficult things to to explain to just all of you who haven't seen a remote control inside there's a lot of
you have all in your remote control and
but then we have to make their remote control a long lasting right just
so that's the size of the remote control and
what for station the ads using remote controls
if you have an l. c. d. on the remote control what would think if it's
but they find most remote controls very ugly so the design
i think it's better to have it on the remote control "'cause" it has

of met and it's the top of the remote control with a little bit of
them here i have the top of the remote control

that we have to decide what's control so we need so
what control so we need

and we will look forward and don't make remote control which for the older televisions
i users they dislike the look and feel of current remote controls
one thing i didn't say you think it's that's a lot of users also it's and i will to by a good-looking remote control if there will be want
only the aim at the younger market stay as you seen in the usability that they will buy a looking remote control
buttons and we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like our

but to have a trendy remote control we can also make something like a nokia mobile phones to change covers
when you're have a remote control do you would change the cover

we can also make a button or would that work on menu of button and then
maybe just an menu button to use it on our televisions and
then i think the menu button only work on the new with televisions
and a menu button and
button and if you press the main building you get into the menu and you can use
menu and you can use the same buttons but

but i fired even young people say it's hard to use remote control so if you

on it and the chills you that's my remote control i made a picture of

working design that
it's working design
presentation working design

it's a little difficult i'm gonna tell you if it's about the working
control work about it of it
that's a short how it works
it has to work on what are all televisions
but then we'll have to just put five colours on it and see if it works it would want works
'cause it has to work on all television
after two is thirty minutes for work and

also because of costs and not too much buttons on it we can also
and the buttons when you used
so a lot of unused buttons it's
buttons use buttons find uses us very important and it's walls and how
all the power button
and you can't find the minutes in that project document folder inclusive the buttons

stack point that's important functions should be this kind of on the remote control modification

yes i showed there's a short talk about the technical function design i thought
i thought the technical function design was to for remote control to have some influence on the t. v. set
much more or of more functions on the remotes maybe
maybe more devices you can influence
that was my functional and talk
so the design of a remote call is very important and it

and when you push the button it will will be sent to the chip and the chip
lost it thing you push a button and then you're a bleep and we'll find it
and it all by pushing a button on the remote that was from my own
