and it's gonna be hopefully one time thing when you said that should be in fact ago but we have to include the
but we have to include the functions that can pull out to set up from the first place
right good presentation
good presentation thank
and you we just need something that really i mean
is there but they it needs to be shit has e. and it but yet simple sell
sell that's really what we need to do we need it to
they like i he's the buttons one
i think it's like the engineering courses user where is like the
where is like the engineering she showed that the germans are more complex and
and user so we need all of the buttons that are contain them there because they only use ten percent buttons really
i think that's a pretty good though
again something that allow us to skip over between devices that's
'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which may
requirements first it's only going to be a t. v. remote were trying that
so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote
it's like black and white kind of
high school educated
what if we gave it a charger and on the charger

and the question that we could ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be filled by this remote control and
yes it is important for the remote control world
and cents our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high class we could consider it
today and our rival companies manufacturer remote that you would press the button on t. v. you know what a remote would beep so that if you have lost it
you could if we include that if we wanted to
wouldn't think so "'cause" we could probably get it from like them all from anywhere company make
make tennis of the chips pretty cheap
which comes
you can also get a kind of the t. v. guide so
it's the whole screen
it's gonna make it nicer
use it i mean it they want something user friendly so
even if we kept the regular standard size of remote if we reduce the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra "'cause" are saying they only
then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent size buttons
i think we need a call

welcome to our second meeting this is
meeting this is the functional design meeting and i hope you all
let's get started
gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control and then gonna
and green do this on that forty minutes
they're easily available typically a
i think that's a good idea because
we're trying to get our main out in the world and
of the internet nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news at and we have twenty
at and we have twenty four hour news channels not too so those are our new product
power source rather is it going to have
is it going to have a charger or is it going to be run strictly have batteries we have

volume going up and down and then mute a mute function and
for example flavour wind fast forward stop parts and there and enter be
functional requirements
to necessary you for
typically was as you saw for now because probably those remote control the time much like any
what exactly is a smart chip
users might chip is just a chip that's been programmed in designed so that it can be complete of fair range of functions
is that gonna push us over production costs
and channel you know
because people really or looking for a remote that's more high-tech
that and to our cost so i wonder
that would include battery source

after the opening a a i am going to but they'll the role of secretary take the meeting minutes and we're gonna have three presentations
out what i needed to complete inflation profits "'cause"
'cause you know some of it also has to be considered and it's gonna be
now i have courtney with the functional requirements
need something that really i mean there's some other point is there but they
like we know the batteries working
in for right "'cause" you know when the battery start sign in your remote currently you have to actually stay right that bulb and go may push this button is it working we can skip that
a normal remote "'cause" most remotes have small square buttons i think
we don't have it but it's like they just have this channel where it just has news and weather kind of sports it's very
you mentioned older people would just
no kids need to know the user i think they got a

and we're gonna have three presentations one from each of you then
first
and you have a mute button and the numbers need to act and the power buttons like
the power buttons like to see two different had the more complex and more simple version
typically a remote has either two double a. "'s" or four triple it's sometimes three it really
a large on off button demographically
demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people so a
and have it lighting up the keys you right
we should go for the lowest denominator
correct because people use ten percent

and then lastly we're going to determine it's working design how exactly will perform its functions that's the whole technical
that's the whole technical side of
he just give him and it look like a making some don't
let's go ahead and it back
no so they need know technical experience to operate
does the most important ones
and we wanna keep a

a questionnaire we found that of the users are not technically happy with current remote controls seventy five percent
it shouldn't be larger buttons in general you know like if the
i think we should like i think that would be in it as in like in for the design
so our target group is you mentioned
would just be universal for everyone you think because i think even
think they got a change between disney channel cartoon or
and we also need to determine the specific functions of this just

each of you then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements
first i want to discuss the goals of this meeting first we need
seventy five percent think they're ugly eighty percent
we need it to be simple if you get it's it needs to be high-tech looking so
it's from my research
the functionality of the product really to be considered as to like whatever buttons we really need on it and

first we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we could
and then we're going to determine the technical functions what is the effect of the apparatus what actually is it
and if you can read it but it says that go to free is slow repeat a programme mute and
preferences so you've you said r. a. that we need a large on off button you think anything else
and we need to promote our company more so we need to somehow
a make a note here do we wanna keep the number buttons down correct

i would assume so i think which was
remote i think that we should go with something that's more user friendly where the engineering ones
and so just it just to clarify that
just to clarify that speech recognition you mean they would say channel five and i think we go to five
so you can put it in the dark
those are our new product requirements right

what actually is it supposed to deal with people pick up a remote can use it for
consumers are really interested in it and
this we need a power source for gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multifunctional
so the red would be the front of the remote there right
just black with just text

do you have a powerpoint or no
save it in the project documents
the channel going up and down
whether that means like we can go and decide the brightness the screen things like that all the more complicated functions and then use
not kids right

and then on the right it's a lot more simply it's got
but it really need to be simple so
that's kinda
we can skip that whole thing
how will wobble to know be case

so method of our design i think i just a realistic that some of the things that we actually need to put into this we need a power
definitely n. x. ray
to know be case there's no way you're gonna be able to make it you know
just to get it all on paper so
on paper so we said it needs to send messages to the t. v. needs to change the channel turn on and off just basic simple like this so if you

and then gonna close the meeting and green
all not kids
they all the different age groups have different designs for speech recognition so
so older people don't really care

the function of
and then at the menus for d. v. as as t. v. whether that means
and you can see on the left it's got a lot more buttons and if you
more simply it's got volume it's got the play that like circles that would just play were wind it also what is the past four is also like next on the menu c. have

and you can cite if that's what we want that if we want to include that in the remote if that's something that would stay on the t. v. itself for example
my team wasn't very clear that the "'kay"
and you know teletext is
i would think that because you have to develop a base

that we discussed
but only use ten percent of their brains
good place to necessary you for
the design i think we should definitely go with

we need something simple because
i mean they do need to be able to identify and
the power to the logo
'cause are saying they only use ten percent of them then

where the engineering ones the boxes stand make it look more complicated than it really is
so no d. v. d. you know t. the most a real savvy
a real savvy be multifunctional
it's very bland looking is just text on

range of consumers so even though we need a small number buttons we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a d. v. d. player at even though what exactly are we using it for as as
so we need a him but not corny marketing scheme for promoting our product and also we
chip you do that or the smart chip will have to be extremist right
so we're going to go anywhere from tends to wood all in the age range

i'm just random of it
subcomponent which would be like a way of deferring the power to different parts of the device the
this is just like a rough schematic so this
is just text on the screen not even

it's it's very important
what we're going to do right now is come to some decisions the fan have a we can all agree on about the target group and the functions and
we need to do and then we'll close the meeting so

exactly holding it
on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to know how much each button is used but those are the
but those are the devil at a point

we're gonna have this which between the power source and the rest of it you're gonna need to switch extra
extra bulb could just be for flashy know is
the chip and of course the infrared bulb so we can communicate with the various devices that he needs to talk to

back in yes so what i wanna do
so what i wanna do right now is here from a t. v. or on your research that you just tend to look like stars off

for example switch on switched off or this channel go to channel nine ten volume up etcetera
so the considerations it's just for example that what it needs to include it's the numbers you

and we just we watch them and we also made of a questionnaire we found
a possible in

much like any small pointer cellphone and
this one and i'm gonna go back to my powerpoint "'cause" we need to discuss

ergonomics of your hand movements or something
out will still put that as a point do we need to discuss so that would include battery

really need to provide more information on what r. s. time
i think it should be a working design

i think which was a know as remote control experts but it also
but it also is so the channel the volume and the power buttons are most important on our

how much extra would be additional chip he is that gonna push us
this is my fifty second design

power source i figured batteries "'cause" they're
but it's becoming outdated now because of the internet nobody

selection button for various entertainment devices so you want something that will permit you to select the d. v. d. player or a d. t. v. with a stereo system
smart chip that preferred so that permits universal application again

power source over here we're gonna have
so this would be the front so the

so this is the internal workings
that's gonna be what's communicating with the t. v. but

the all the light up a kind of
most of them will into if we pick it up there

a good idea because you know that's one of the most important buttons
let's talk about all of our

anyone else
do we want this thing to be able to be found easily

i mean we need a like a homing device
device or a whole i'll think of a

could if we had a speech recognition and we can start naming it had like a another kind of more handicapped disabled then it demographic
there is the people who desire speech recognition there's the different them but demographics have different desires i don't know if

it's really in the people twenty five to thirty five i
five i feel those are the people that really what a lot of t. v. they all the one to

and i hope you all had did individual work and

here's the agenda for the meeting after the opening

to look like stars off

and i like them first

put it in project documents

the function of a remote control as what we've been informed it is to send messages to the television set for

it's the numbers you know zero to nine so you can move to channel the power button on slash off

and then functions for a v. h. s. t. v. d. for example

and enter be for like you know the menus and then

yes there are two examples and you can see

and so the system or the buttons that is in ideas one example and then

c. have functions that are duplicating

and then lastly is the questions are we want to consider like

like what functions so we want it to include and how simple complex it should be and what functions

and what functions it needs to complete out

you speak was the to the wiki

who would like to file that or not

do you want me to run it or you wanna

yes so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab and

eighty percent white people are willing to spend more which is good news for us if we make it look fancy or and

and that meaning what

what you mean by the current remote controls not match the operating behaviour of the user like they have to press buttons

it works ready for

and so people will say that they typically was as

and i think we need something

simple because most people all thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one and we don't wanna do we wanna

and we don't wanna do we wanna very too far from the normal standard remote i mean they do need to be able

it's very important

that's what my a website and i

and so personally i think that we need a moderate eye-catching design but it

so saying from me you were side your presentation the engineering versus the user specified remote i

and it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers so

as as the age range so we

and also we found to our team the mets speech recognition is it's like it up and coming thing they've really

thing they've really consumers are

i sell

i'd be lovely

i we can interpret it like we can just try out different types of speech recognition as an hour no problem

so like what the remote phone use it or

you know like go to the case

i'm ready for our last presentation in there

'kay i mean get a chance to complete this one because some of the tools that i was getting frustrated

extra functions will probably need an additional chip you

nothing here

it really kind it depends on the size of the actual remote itself

so a large on off button would probably be good selection button for

so what exactly we're looking it's like the front of the remote

with the t. v. but the other bo i think it's good just indicate i'm doing something sort of like of reassurance

so you don't have to stay right that in for right "'cause" you

anything you wanna have a personal preferences so you've

you know like if the examples i had there's like quite small so should we trying go

so should we trying go for so it has a larger buttons

i think we should definitely go with buttons they don't look like a normal remote "'cause" most

buttons i think we should do something like a big earn round like bowls

we'll come to a decision later about all the components that we need to include that wrap

that wrap up this one and

requirements which may very seen forced upon screen better later which

x. t. we are your product

your product requirements first

were trying that over complicate things so no d. v.

in the states we don't have it but

like running along the bottom

i'll give you this ports

it is a like the weather channel word scale like the ticker running on about

except the entire screen

it's the entire screen is just whining information and then seemingly

you can takes boards you can take c. news you entertainment you know it's like

so it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching

right but it's becoming

so do we have to include the company colour within that

somebody colour being yellow

the functions and just different things that we need to do and then we'll close

because i think even if something has large buttons as long as they're not childish lee large like even technically

not antek good chance people are gonna use it i

so what for our target group would we say i mean young an old are all age ranges all

take a technical specifications like how technically

like how technically literate are these people we're going to be using a remote

i would say you we should say dumber than the average person

so if you have something to say it and why it to mind meeting minutes

most channel on off button volume you

volume

you know does the most important ones

finding kind of device or

like if this is gonna get lost any take a rich how are we going to a comedy to be quick ability to find it

and on the charger just like a phone like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger and if you leave

and if you leave your phone somewhere you push the button to find it finds of the phone beeps for you

it's useful for the remote from

with that and to our cost

if you have the basic you start putting a charger and then you have a different kind of battery

rechargeable batteries it cheaper usual way

i think we can make a decision on that later out will

we have seen to deal issue that you mention of speech recognition if we want

a way copy onto the thing sits black they all the different age

they all the one to get addicted to soap operas and

and if we did you say when they're at this stage they're going to probably i was by remote that has
