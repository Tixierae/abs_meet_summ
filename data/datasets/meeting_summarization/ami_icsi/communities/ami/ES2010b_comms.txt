out what i needed to complete inflation profits "'cause"
need something that really i mean there's some other point is there but they
sell that's really what we need to do we need it to
really need to provide more information on what r. s. time
range of consumers so even though we need a small number buttons we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a d. v. d. player at even though what exactly are we using it for as as
no kids need to know the user i think they got a
i think we need a call
i mean we need a like a homing device
"'cause" we need to we definitely need have buttons for like subtitles and things like that is because

and you have a mute button and the numbers need to act and the power buttons like
the functionality of the product really to be considered as to like whatever buttons we really need on it and
that's true and also remember that miss teenage we need you know like a hundred button to use to
so we need up down inside the side buttons

most channel on off button volume you
you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons

is there but they it needs to be shit has e. and it but yet simple sell
we need it to be simple if you get it's it needs to be high-tech looking so
we need something simple because
simple because most people all thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one and we don't wanna do we wanna
but it really need to be simple so
on paper so we said it needs to send messages to the t. v. needs to change the channel turn on and off just basic simple like this so if you

the power buttons like to see two different had the more complex and more simple version
like what functions so we want it to include and how simple complex it should be and what functions
and what functions it needs to complete out
and we also need to determine the specific functions of this just

and we don't wanna do we wanna very too far from the normal standard remote i mean they do need to be able
i mean they do need to be able to identify and

so method of our design i think i just a realistic that some of the things that we actually need to put into this we need a power
this we need a power source for gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multifunctional
we're gonna have this which between the power source and the rest of it you're gonna need to switch extra

so we need a him but not corny marketing scheme for promoting our product and also we
and we need to promote our company more so we need to somehow

a large on off button demographically
so a large on off button would probably be good selection button for
preferences so you've you said r. a. that we need a large on off button you think anything else
because i think even if something has large buttons as long as they're not childish lee large like even technically

gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control and then gonna
and the question that we could ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be filled by this remote control and
the function of a remote control as what we've been informed it is to send messages to the television set for
typically was as you saw for now because probably those remote control the time much like any
yes it is important for the remote control world
i think which was a know as remote control experts but it also

so like what the remote phone use it or
it really kind it depends on the size of the actual remote itself
so the red would be the front of the remote there right
it's useful for the remote from
and if we did you say when they're at this stage they're going to probably i was by remote that has
then they put the voice recognition d. put there like receiver on the actual television in the base or in the actual remote "'cause" then you've already got
'cause then you've already got them and then hand wages can speak to the remote as if you
use to have a remote that's not even go up pass like fifty so i can
yes it your own remote or digital cable "'kay"

where the engineering ones the boxes stand make it look more complicated than it really is
so what exactly we're looking it's like the front of the remote
i think we should definitely go with buttons they don't look like a normal remote "'cause" most
it's very bland looking is just text on
because people really or looking for a remote that's more high-tech
as if you just speaking done on you don't have to have a remote in your hand and like to look at it
to if we said find remote looking remote or something
do we go back to i'm a look
i'm a look really quickly back at those

and so the system or the buttons that is in ideas one example and then
a good idea because you know that's one of the most important buttons

functional requirements
now i have courtney with the functional requirements
are functional requirement

it shouldn't be larger buttons in general you know like if the
so should we trying go for so it has a larger buttons
