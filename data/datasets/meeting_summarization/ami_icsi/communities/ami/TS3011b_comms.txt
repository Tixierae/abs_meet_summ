we will figure that
so we are not even going to try to implemented in our product
it's a board decision
remote control should only be used for television because it's not
the third requirement is that we should focus on customers are the younger than they have forty which is important
i've the goal was a boston move you would like to start
we what we are very career curious to of the market we'll feel about such a product
skip
when the power buttons and use one time and the volume
and the volume but four times so
volume they are most use a lot but more than all the other buttons so
that technical there are i think they're not
we do have a wise board so
we just a few buttons trendy design lightning in fact what and the sound
is maybe there's not a possibility you can make it look
you can make it look like an easy ease of equipment but it's quite elaborate it's
i know but if we use a like a steak for example

i don't think people would bother walking to t. v. and press that button because they are lost the remote
the remote that's just
the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which you can go and at the form some kind of online and then the remote control reports itself so
so it just the basic functions and we don't have to use
mikes "'cause" young people like new features so
as you feel fifties
use so it'll it attract younger people because of new and

you can upload your presentation from here i believe
thing i'm just wondering some signal from where do you execute the this in south i know
that's right it's a problem
but any other sounds which aren't exactly the same from the point if you all from remote control
but how does how this d. remotes are reports it we give back to the user in what state is because
we need to have the the use of function at the functions decide it and our target audience

my personal preference where ease of that use remote control because the user
because the user friendliness and it can be more trendy in and use design but
right there are some devices
it's a unique item
but make this make a sub for it because it's
and do we want the ten digits

but teletext buttons are not in our design so it should
just like the phones the
maybe sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with the solution because that's
it will be a unique feature of a remote control
change yes

we have a slight problem i opened
i opened the c. d. rom box that's
all the extra function
i don't know yet

the top goal of this
control so keep that in mind
personally i think we should infer use infrared because
because otherwise our device can have communicate with almost every t. v. set so

so i think that there should be clear at another important
not those bonds most volume
she would just have a design perfect design for those only those buttons the first
already and our video sets and and there's a special button that find the remote control button you press it and your t.

yes but before i do that all i want to one you that by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated and
i believe so
i assure you i'm not so
if you want to go to channel nineteen you only have that button

no way to do that because we cannot implement that kind of the system
just a round buttons should be the truth i think
and just one function and the problem to programme button to switch to to channels when you have something and channel four n. something on channel six just one button which can jane's
yes that's important

hello florence
it's already no we have a blank
and also quite easy to use so

of the remote work
wise board so i'm not questioning that
younger

but i will tell you about it
expensive but by i'm making
what should we choose in design

if it if as as i can just the blue and
we have forty minutes so
because the product should be interesting and

so that was the main important thing what a remote control should do and i found
this case together nothing more and that's it's almost
so this is this kind of

the multi function and remote control but many possibilities but the lack of the feeling i already bands and in the previous discussion and ease of use remote
and ease of use remote control with the last possibilities a great feeling in touching the buttons
and most easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to the t. v. set i was

what does the market one i don't
sixty and it also
i think it's the same as in cell phone just one like in the device that size and all the buttons and not for

that some changes in the method also
components which can zoom far less power than a conventional components and
but not for each button one letter think

there are few buttons connected the buttons
the buttons let's and
i think it will attract more are public i think we can

there are some devices to incorporates this technique already and
yes and we want it to make so it's an easy as possible for "'cause" most so
so what about the clapping

see the line in light of lightning
it's a distinction in the market it's a different
which was the third most the second most used function

think so because when you have the newspaper over your remote controller you cannot see it so
we want sport teletext which was
did how do you feel about that do you agree

to look like i do
i do watch and watch
it's what's your last name

hello welcome back
is there any time for a cup of coffee can i get a cup of coffee

the weightings for sebastian
can i get a cup of coffee

all this is live
it almost

i open c. d. rom box accidentally that's alright
then the three if you prepare the presentation i think so stand

people welcome back with the second meeting
and i think it's worth and looking and probably more interesting than the lights

i'm not if you received them as
the secretary

because it's not of feasible it's not
but the question is whether two or four buttons makes makes such a difference in the costs if you already planned to include fancy lightning techniques i

feasible it's not so
so we cannot make it because of the time to market that we have to do with the third

our products so the call it colours and the slogan do have to be in the product
that thing in your hands like a turning on and off the light

any questions on these requirements
so that's the total design of this piece of equipment that's not a moderate

so the important thing is
and it might attract all the people because it's easy to use

and it's also it of its insight in the topic what
a tried to implement picture here but

trust
tool channel

i have the basic scheme of things which are implement
and the money we say if we using this we can use for an average fancy lighting and techniques blinking lights and all that kind of fancy i think our

that's not a moderate it's very
at another important point is that we really should use energy sparse friendly components they're

it's very easy it's been dorm
but are we not it's in the menu all i mean

do this so so personally i think
so we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really what the market needs so

now the other a little bit more expensive but
it's quite complicated because how can you

see that's still true of course but in use ten percent the buttons the
so they of use the the most important button and there are lots of people

are i think they're not technical difficulties there's no
that's and it's i believe so

if you lost i don't
just or d. e. c. design we can make a design when they're not my much buttons in it so

according to read
in because i was writing it down in the last new send

according to read it people do not use all the extra features very often so
new send right

i was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling by these kind of sticks or something like that i don't know if it's
is because we do not implement use it to

we need to find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user friendliness
so i don't think it's we have something to do that we can discuss

we do have to decide this meeting
for example that's what we should think about really know how is

a full it's not necessary to have the fullest but the one
but the one the kind of functions for example the most important or volume and programme selecting

maybe i should write that down left
the secretary

let me see

there's one of mine

hello

the remote work i have no time either so

all this is live so it at all

if people welcome

for now on the schedule are a few points first of

first of all the opening which

all the opening which we are doing now

seconds i received some new project requirements i'm not if you

almost

almost then we'll do your

then we'll do your one as part of the last

you can you try to

the top goal of this meeting is to reach decision on the product on the target group and the functions of the remote control so

the new project

the new project requirements first of all

first of all we didn't speak about it but we should

about it but we should not support teletext in the remote because

because are board of feels that teletext is out of date and the internet

and the internet is replacing teletext so

which is important for you do it and as for a little because the product

and it should be bought by people younger than forty

therefore go as important the corporate image should be recognisable in our products so the call

the individual

the individual presentations i've

is the first

we they discuss is already in this in the previous discussion the

the method of the remote control is just a function of remote

just a function of remote control is to send messages to the television set

and i found that are two different kind of remote controls the multi function

but your new goal for was for people than less than forty years old so maybe

so maybe the multi function and can be implemented in in our design but

but it should be i think it should be a combination but teletext buttons

so it should take out eight buttons or so but not as in my opinion

but not as in my opinion the it be easy to use r. c. is the best one possibility for us

in the market

just for a for used is user or friendliness i should choose for the ease of use remote control

excuse me

there are some changes in the design requirements so that some

all this device has to do is to send messages to t. v. set and

picture here but it's hardly readable

casey no

there's the energy source

there's the energy source here and

there is connected to free things user interface

user interface connect to chip which is connected

which is connected to the sender which generates

which generates messages using infrared light which

which is sent to the receiver that's the idea

that's the idea and

and doesn't little bit you just for your imagination how the device like this should look or can look

what have i found

usually these kind of things consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip set a circuit boards that's all

that's all this case together

it's almost every piece of equipment every piece of every t. v. set is controlled infrared there are some exceptions

there are some exceptions but

but most of all have infrared controls and

and the more luxury a remote controls and let them buttons and i

the on the dark concept we discuss

the end it's a little more little bit more fancy also so maybe

so maybe we should consider that

this is all the rest is just

the rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected

and the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared light diodes and there's not a

and there's not a power source here

so it's very easy

easy it's been dorm many times before and i think we should

and i think we should to we should succeed in a plan to do this so

they're specially designs and energy friendly components which

and if we want to use a rechargeable design or energy save design we should really implement them

for cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost the circuit board and

and because most the production cost r. in just a part of the equipment and

if we use and that's it doesn't use so much more energy or

no that was power friendly less also so we can use them

so we can use them so that's no problem

or the same costs can be in

combined with the low cost circuit boards this

could only let's the buttons the use most so that channel switching

a lighted they're more or less in lot of us no

mine is already outdated

since the

so any income is welcome input

then i'm that the target market is to tell million units

of some of which we should sell about to forty percent to make the five million

but since the old part is forty percent of the market i

i older you might want to constrain that portion market but

but since the requirements changed that's

that's not a good idea

skip this

the buttons to use that are used about fifteen hundred times when the

and there are lots of people complain they kind can find the remote controls so

remote controls so we might want to build in the future to support them some audio signal like one phones

or a find the finding function you know

that's the interesting it it separates

it it separates our product from others as

i just said there and they're

and he also said it

so that's all the market tells us

volume and the zap buttons are mostly used so

the first

yes we should focus on that i

there's no but i wrote technique a used in this kind of equipment so

i don't think we have a ticket there so we

so maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and sound signal

the sound signal is one

yes think that's a that's a problem usually

i know device is not the solution it should

problem usually

maybe like that thing in your hands like

but maybe all in get some new technologies for

you press it and your t. v. set starts to make a kind of weights out and your remote controls

and your remote controls and start a beep and

reports or to spend response to it

but d. c.'s don't have all a buttons

because we do not have at home

but i believe you love and

we do not control the t. v. set so

and even if the t. v. set would have such a button you would have to walk you t. v. is

so what about the clapping technique because

i'm convinced sebastian will find the one solution for us

it's quite complicated

because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds

take a restriction the characteristics of clapping it's just an increase in the volume the amplitude of the sound which is

peak

which is generates a few times within that a certain period of time but any other

so if you'd be watching a movie it would can see beep

but we can have just a home station for base station next to see this a little antenna or something if

then that's something for something more easily

something like that you do not want another device which can be everywhere in the house which you have to find first before you can find your remote control

just a base station next a t. v. is a bus with nancy

like that but it will be very costly i think so

maybe we do agree on the thing that the remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things maybe sebastian

i think so that's not a good idea

because that's it's his field of expertise

and it will become more costly also because there will

because there will be additional components which will be used and there

and there are some input to it

and do we even are you sound above the the let's the lightning function

market it's a different exactly it's

exactly it's in unique feature and i think

and that's about the user interface i come up with and easy remote control and the advanced remote control what should

of the numbers i have no right here

channel selection is the most important

so on the relevance

so on the relevance scale the channel selection the volume selection and the teletext

and we don't have to use it for d. v. d. players and all kind of so

that out question so

we should save costs by not implementing a lot of functions and

functions and the money that we can say from that we should use for having a design and thinking about the user interface and

do you think the market would respond to a simple

if we include other in a stiff functions then they mikes "'cause"

it's because it's as many functions maybe it's

maybe it's more important to make it look like very it's trendy easy to catch piece of equipment but

but and but nevertheless

all i mean if you have few buttons know display i mean i it's working with a shift functions and one button can

i don't know if it's user-friendly as you feel fifties

maybe we can use a light for that when you move the stick

when you move the stick to to a position maybe light next to it can it up so you know

so you know i've just push a button or change the channel or to not the volume something like

and if you use that stick for volume control and channel selection you have them to most important function in one button

and we could have a other buttons for the advanced other functions

but as an eye then

an eye then should just use instead of just take like many cellphones just around me

draw it on the board

is just an easier way of a round button what's which can be pushed in for directions instead of a stake if they give from

it's not really stick with

if they give from work for ball when it's fun and down or

it can break down

or just a round

yes and is also looks more fancier think i think

think we can marking them

volume and something like that

programme out and down and the four

and the pen doesn't really does what i want

but we still we're still in the question of and putting in advanced options but

but it's just all those the market is interested in some advanced new techniques

however it keeping it simple is it is important for the costs and all those kind of things we need to find a

but i think our next step to look at is just that's so i don't think

that we can discuss it right now "'cause"

it right now "'cause" you know one of us have has information to discuss about that i think

'kay but that this is so is just scrapped

do you wanna list of functions do you want an explicit list which incorporates all functions available device

i do not want a full

to ten digits

for example

how is the remote going to look not any user interface that

a bit of a split know to look like

i'd put all the minutes i make into the shared folder so

folder so if you want to have a look at it you know where to find it

for it because it's time to fill up already

if you want to do it so i'll send

that's complicated but is

but is that so relevant because i don't

i wouldn't buy personally remote control without that and it's and i
