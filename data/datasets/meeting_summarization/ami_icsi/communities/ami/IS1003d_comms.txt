so we used to basic colour yellow and red and the shape
no i mean inspiration
inspiration is
so four point three point five minutes it acceptable
one being true and seven being false
do we have a fancy look-and-feel according to
it's it should be lemon like so
so we can set
she is true it's fine for
that for macrophone so
there's the technology inside a quick look simple focal comments and you can
it's see a cat
and you can to it so maybe it's take not technologically that's in that's it
see a cat or a white guy
so using the same scary too
use need to come on
you but this stunning can you
it's depend on the dangle it in the
i agree but i mean if
how you need to know i mean
easy to you can say fifty and fifty it's so
but look at the money's roo we've said
but when you're zapping it changing from one child to the other so you're passing through
if you changing your mind
course and from ten to ten channels like you
but it may be fine
as i said in the first meeting went to have sought a remote control that would cost more than twelve and one fifty euros and it's not it's
so i suppose but we have solar cells how
how many do we do you need solar cells to thing one would be
to thing one would be enough for such as
do when it's special colour you
i think it's really like the scroll are in fact you saw it

it's perfect
your judgement is biased
so i'll still play the role the cedar tree and
and our industrial designer about that
see i'm this would be the unique design the market so it's a fancy
maybe i hope so
so it's a fancy design and the unique design
we're still so much more the cat of you know for
but you know we integrate these are the different colours
it'd be a fancy
looks like more fruit maybe
you said previously that she cares some microphone inside and
really good point maybe
channel five to change
but then that when you're done it
that's the weak point because
it's nine or
as we have a battery right kinetic
and sample sensor sample speaker
just keep on calling just an idea
would case uncurved flat single curved double curved i think
rather four buttons on
that's special colour so
we i think we have a problem

do you think it wants me it was price increase the price
it would be that more like a lemon
maybe a pineapple
dating
that's a good idea that's great
i have no idea is that
a thought and then the ball if you want to obtain
first one is we have to just a fancy look-and-feel
it looks like a
that i would say they're small too much read
so much right in the basement
right it's so from one to seven
seven
look for it's true it's she is true it's
yes very easy

cannot find it so it's you can put it to the table so we can turns on the board switching to select the channel
and first one was
fancy look-and-feel
seven isn't that the maximum
no seven is false and one is true
this is mike for reading fact that for macrophone
one to ten to twelve button to thinking in the t. v. and this
so let's say it's too expensive
maybe to scroll wheel and we have the colours course to find scroll wheel

the integrated you know
done about what he's outside so what the
so what the inside is is what we talked before about you know as a cheap user
i mean it's not obvious
it's intended to
a like a time stamp if you take
if you take the remote so and you
i agree but i mean if you're from two

because mushroom was not in the trends and i was
and i was fruits
so you can't no one degree two degrees know
was thinking that but there's a lot of comedies easy to you can say
but it has to be on to since if we can assess
you just push too bad and a zero and one sixty
but that's different ski all so

a whole slice
and you can discuss everything
it's so long
we have harmed in a more no
zero four of the others
so we all already nineteen

i mean we're gonna try to measure of how good e. d.s instead of
maybe if you change if you take the bus and salads
it's in bad it macrophone this that
this that's true too function is this
if you're simply
and you kinda like to add to change a channel i think

and you know you have the finger so you're with the buttons
is it's better like that's
it is if they say that and a light so that it could be channel three channel four channel five to change
no you can't put a doubts as just
doubts as just your training from the base you need to have
if you want to turn you can't use it and then it's impossible

yellow or when you say technology could be small i know in the core of thing or
we have tactilely buttons
you four
i mean does that sort of agree but this one would be more five to me i'd like i
you compare with traditional of to do is not controller i
but you'd also the leading the but if you do not but if you go nuts all the brought in all the channel you can that's also a button here

this channel but if you really want you to do zapping you laundry know what you want to you kinda and it's just go through all the channels
easy to use it's very do that you would
do that you would three it's fine i think it sort of an l. c.
i agree
so reasonable useful is one
the best thing so

but anyway this is not a mushroom anyway so that's fine
and inspired colour and
a cheap user or whatever two and
you know you don't need to consider you know which
instead of just talking about we had

you if you want to ski from channel one to channel tool you use keep this if you want to from
that it's like fine from cost of fine if it's
of fine if it's cost if it's fine
that is cost to find design
three for three four it's it is it isn't it for three

maybe i will lead to be our two designers talk about some of their us
in the base that's the basic and where is this all
where is the solar cells
i think in a drawer you have three

genetically modified much room i was there but i couldn't speak in
you know senator it is yellow and black the
that's why if you put it in the table that you can throw some only that you could
you don't you dare is it

it's a life
much of a design
it's not like in a remote from the you have you know the like lemon you know senator
just three so

it's a likely you cannot find it so
that's the kinetic source
fine course and
if you were we really want to have a fruitful remote

and where is this all the solar cell
i mean fancy was defined by use fruit and veg it will look
be that are not that don't know what i meant
what one of them key point is solar cells

is it easy to use
i think it's quite easy to do some zapping that maybe it will be
it's than this prototype maybe
i think the prices

i mean you're famous you we
what's this is jerry
all ball the smaller that so you can't you can't contra scale that's in
that's in the traditional control how to control the scale

participant
if it could be one side and you
so are we tried to judge use it should with one to seven scale of one

for that part
so this is our product or prototype
so just have a look at the here is to be

you the traditional key traditional controller use button to select the channel and now we have
as a percent but
geez

and that's q. button you can
three
it's abbott

in fact this is this is a kind of thing you revolutionary so our receptor that we can put outside and from i don't think so i
is it you have microphone array in where you have
that's another really good point maybe

at that will have first two so
so when you say i want to go to channel number twenty that's you decided to go to channel twenty so
a comment says exactly

shit
this has to stay on the table
kinetic we don't have it so i suppose but

unique and the colour
so my mouse
that maybe it will be too fast

and used to look for it's true it's
it's the largest a pretty state prisons as entertaining
prisons as entertaining this was be fine

three i will say three
how the hell you know this end of that you to crack on
it's worry they because you know how many and channel are there in the

i think technically it's acceptable so
by pushing is euro left after the first one
as a number of them just three

you know it's a manual when you stop take a way to stop
and this would be more for browsing or
base you need to have everything in the hand if you want to turn

just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there's something interesting
good choices today be jordan
that to can all ball the smaller

it's maybe we can change from
therefore it's more than one so
you saw it on each on it so

we'll have if there is people just presentation by our user interface design a baby jordan and our industrial
that's the whole notion is a vegetable

if where we all agree on me for the kick off building of these remote control will evaluate c. d. in production so
you need to put it on and diana

this is made by plane
looks trendy

i read these are the small attractive so we
these we call it the martian design it

and the shape there's two basic shape the first
shape the first is the cycle and the second be the triangles these we

design it looks like so much room so we call it mushroomed design so this
so you can capture it's not quite strong different directions

and now we have it starts call so we can paint is all that to select channel is quite coming
is quite coming in for user to use it

get this done touch don't destroy your but still i have
that's the woods a plastic this on it then

you have to integrate the fruit aspect you know
fruit aspect you know there was

colour and very sophisticated matter so
no it's are we would buy it

so what we what i can add to
i what i can add to use that you know what she's done about what

so where's the battery
in the base that's

i have no idea for it you like
if you use funds

and where is the voice recognition
fine i mean they it's that i would say they're small

that's the second point first one is
in the basement

that's a it's a pineapple now
the clock is the colour as a two

is it easy to use
eight floors of luck one yes it's a might be easy is

so you can paint to change the channel
you know how we treat it easy to turn things to change channels

i'm not i'm not that's really convinced it's the best way to if you wanna jump from other one to twenty
how can you go or direct you to twenty for example

i think something that three
it's impossible you need to put it on

you have a clicking clicking i that's fine
no what's your opinion

roo we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be the main
that also a number you know

so you're passing through all the channels so when
that's true that's why we have the solar to get so

to go to channel twenty so you can say channel twenty one channel four because you really want to go on this channel but if
it's d. screen on off

if you want to from it's keep from channel one to channel can you can do is that it's like
but you have the bogle comments

but that i didn't see where is it to turn off to ten and twelve buttons would like it's maybe
it you can do it but you'd also the leading

most the time you have it's a sleeping
it's a sleeping remote control

so three
so which number

for three maybe can vote to
maybe can vote to see how many if we would use

controller i think it's easier than to do is a comparably to use
do is a comparably to use for these are countries have to put a button and i don't have to push button you have

this has to stay on the table right this
for easy to use for can say four

paul
so no button supplements

especially on their easy to use
as c. display in the interface

i think it's more like double curved
double curve

it's a terrific

a terrific i am i'm afraid

i'm afraid

this remote control is there a prototype

so where is the remote control

let's go for our detailed design meeting

so we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control and it's not

and it's not have an idea of the price that's this thing who knows

and in case if where

are the basic colour is yellow and red yellow it's

yellow it's our company colour i read

so this is the introduction of our per hour that's not something

couldn't speak in

it's a life so that's

so that's our key features of our pro prototype the first

the first day that's eighty five see i'm

the second key features that it's so called channel out so i sent you the traditional

the third stage very that stable at triangle be as in

in this state that is triangle basis of mars table so

you can see that this shape of the buttons and is mushrooms or

everything's much room so

room so we can call our remote control that much room

don't know but it but if you have to integrate the

that's and vegetables

so i think it's something usable

can see it's every day kind of readable but you know we integrate

i think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable by using you know as

you know as you know very delighted colours

i dunno whatever chips inside and you know

no but it is under breathe

under breathe if you're in the base

so use the money what's your opinion according to these remote control

we had three key use key points to for this remote control design and

think i've just let me check

you have colours

of this shape is abortion

of this shape is abortion i did

the city's unique and

i agree it's you need is

agree it's you need is it really

so if you don't know how do you define fancy

it's you have the lemon aspect of this but this is this the case

no was a lemon use but i mean it's not obvious

no maybe improving the text or like having the less small as

that's that's a that's a good idea that's

it looks i hope so

hope so it was these

if you want to obtain the ball is very coming in for you to change the board to change the channel

too function is this isn't much for it

the car is that's fine i mean

it looks like a pineapple the cherry on top of a

is it a bit tight

like greta in these easy to take me load you can be take them as you can being innovative

it's a matter of alright so

and you there's the technology

i think in you know sit there are a round remote control so ideas

do we have to it's fine

no maybe the most critical one

false

might be easy is this meeting use need to come on

can you just to explain you know

that this is a base so you

but imagine you

it just imagine you have fifty channels that

it's kind of divided by the number by the by history kinda a certain degree so you

so you got how many degree you it

but you have to go through all the channels you cannot do that

a way to stop the good point

then the angle you stop it and all you need the channel you

this expel

it is it from one channel two maybe ten or is it from

that's not the ecology car

to push button you have you just turn the to the ball that to can

sixty percent

this function is just for all brought in from one channel to the next line to make and that's the sunlight

in the t. v. and this and one two three four five six and things

all so you can choose how much do you want

it's not on the front place

the weak point because with the traditional when you just that one menu

but that they would be able to take it in the pockets and being used in the kitchen say i've lost remote control and nobody would take it

so that this is that the next generation conference

would take it a so and nobody will

you would never use we never lose this one

and nobody will last lose it

four maybe four it's i'll put four

can say four

for it's even easier

it's even easier to maybe

so i average

nine or three

it need maybe somewhat for the work but it's

so that v. project is accepted

but i mean i thing that's be good to do some more work true is one piece into pineapple if you were

how can we had a project to start presentation would be w. haitian so

so as we all agree to accept and the certain conditions the prototype will have a look to final some financial you

we need to calculate them production cost as i said in the first

and it's not it's if it's not the case you would have to redesign it's so

x. shit so has the energy

so has the energy source we have harmed

single simple chip on print just

chip on print just one would be necessary want

is this simple

as we have voice recognition i think

so the case

wood and

it just keep

but what would case uncurved

that's gonna be double curve

if you are rubber

buttons on interface

you may be too we have two special colours

we have two special colours pushbutton

five

scroll-wheel wouldn't

it is more like integrate this call

that's a wee and

i think this if we keep on writing thinks so we have to
