both women and
and the mouses
it's the most basic buttons for the user wants a to use l. s. imports
so they can say what they want to let's go to channel one and that's the kind of things anyone to maybe
what i have a little preview on the remote control to use some channel
is that manageable "'cause" it
it sounds to use possible
that's it i think is pets but the continue
which channel so i can said to
so it's it does did recognise
it does did recognise itself you have
gets the remote control where
we've all had at once i want to watching television
modes if you want to make a remote universal then the process there has to make but different morse code went some button was pressed that make
i think it's also good with the fashion everything so
they wanna pay for it people are willing to spend money actually to buy a remote that they like the way
a preview but i'm not if it's even possible for example of all
it but that's rules out universal remote control
but how are you gonna use that if you're i mean if your remote
low all box you can see t. v.s find it
so i think imply a speech really she's such a small apparatuses very hard to do
it's not mature technology
i think must be a way it went for the more complicated functions of the television presence
around to not the top but round the volume selection i don't know where
to try to find out that i'm not if this information available on this but

that's what my personal preference right
itself you have to set it
the losses the computer crest so
our recognisable which is battery park in yellow but
for example of all t. v. guide and you have a little
text things you can use remote as a t. v. it's even possible
you assume that they we'd correctly and i think
it's just like breaking have more individual work after that so
but we like some curve euros
perhaps you should also make something like a flash lights if you if it's lost the people that are they have they wanted
that people
but in total cost a lot a normal why
because that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries a docking station
we could either make a separate station which just sends the signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it

and the use you zap a lot of
but there are quite some issues
so far except for the much use to be used lights up a lot
i was it back
easy to implement should go for that and speech
versus good speech
because the television it's response to disagree on it doesn't know how it
or we could use a double sided for less used functions you
i'll put some paper and present
shall we also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote that
it charges itself we don't need a basis it

there was a little problem with my computer
i mean for example if you're into durability issue you could for example if
you always grab the wrong one was
to one of the trial your thing but
but they should be central you can
very important
have a lot idea i'm not
this to channel up and down
which are so but it's you're the remote
the what the paper cover which is so

what i wanna know first
there are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear so either
so either we lose those or
it's that's not as easy as it might do like
they have like a switch
because of the dinner at night that people
remote or not because that's that the missed anything i'm gonna do now
and five takes a lot of batteries again
that's maybe a bigger or less of the thing so you i think

this is what it look like a looks like it if you press one button so this is not think
say i'd have to i think you know have to make under remote controls make a basic one and
what we could do what could be possible as maybe not an l. c. d. screen with a preview but i
go for universal because were a separate company making separate remote controls to sell to do whatever's people i think euros
that far as especially
everything we targeted under forty so
what i was you use functions by buying or
at the back side of remote is just a little hole
i like to be part i think so

you don't sell it to sell the just
or you want it to recognise your favourite channel i see you
so i recognise is your favourite channel
has gone so
so we agree on the part that we need to get something on the other remote to find it somewhere increase in
then at the scene no sense to by buttons you have infrared
and since you're holding it like this i suggest you put the channel up channel down volume
so then you can choose if every decision know

the findings
it here again that's my story about the different modes if you want
i don't think we should remove the button because are always
the button because are always people who are using it but i don't think should
the mute button to people use that of "'cause" i'm
are gonna take triangles in your hand drawn
i would buy it myself

i have some issues which you discussed earlier let's just
'cause then the buttons have to send out a different signal and then they would normally do and
and they want to pay for it and
the most important thing about young people that they're really sensitive to trends are passing through the world's
for example if you're buttons are fading after i mean if you make it a remote there are so you can is by new cover i'm not it's
for you have to make it will decision between the part if you when you reverse remote control that it should do what people usually do with their t. v.s not the very complicated settings they can use we
that's true but it's only has to do so when you press a button that it's lost

that was only men so
'cause it sounds be expensive to
my personal preferences is a button for my favourite channels so
that's not the screen so i some new information
so i some new information on the project specifications or changing a little
i'm trying big but

so clear we should stick to existing symbols but maybe we could do a little
at first a tall t. v. new anyway
so i think it should be have less or very little buttons and maybe a second
i thought maybe we should move the buttons and then
it could be very flat we very
but you should find it's recharged was important

where is the remote control we've all had at once
you take triangles
maybe the menu button can go it in the middle
you can make a device that
at the end isn't that too expensive because that means

so other aspect
with that concept i start thinking so what i just feel nokia's idea i
idea i just make changeable covers for your i mean those cost hardly
i know it's just one one piece of rubber or
but just take a look at it because

this is where we're gonna do after it's just like breaking
i have to come with the components concept
once and you should isn't trendwatching because
but at the same time if you don't want recharge if you've got recharge it you wanna watch t. v. now you wanna be able to put different batteries in it to use it now and an half an hour
i think it's a pretty good idea to have like

so i'm gonna start to have no
so some technical functions
it costs a lot i think what we could
v. a. was it's like all buttons in you know i do

yes the functional
so that's all i also like to say go a little bit easy on the designs
park in yellow but i'm not if we i think we should
because we're working with different types of television so we're going to work

the findings seventy five
of the relevant buttons are the power the channel selection and volume selection it's the most
it but that's not very important
no for know i think it's just a menu you put over that because

seventy five per cent of the users find most remote controls ugly
that's is how it is done and all remote controls
so if you make a circuit board with the connections already on its then that's cheaper so we have to
is if it's useful to have a rechargeable but at the same

they want to spend money for a better system from that a remote control so we can do a
there's a chance it's not so
i think so i we need to some research into that if we can open the menu i think it's possible
a normal why would be better like

that's very important but
have to do all the button and especially the ones that are the popular buttons so those are was very
so those are was very first
i think that's the most important things that we have no see

it's like a button on your t. v.
you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your t. v. that to be possible
v. that to be possible low
or when you say one to it but it's enough right that

and another thing they want to was speech recognition
i want to watching television where's the remote control
fibreglass otherwise i made of copper that's
and into it and i said i live an indication

i come to some personal experience findings possible solutions later searches for the button
searches for the button
because you don't know which channel is this button so possibly
it's a wave of more make it more

a wave of more make it more durable actually
but maybe we could do a little investigation see whether of some symbols are in need to be replaced by all the
a remote control or i think that's useful
but they can also be recharged with the remote would why

like but do a study i'm working on that for the costs have to
no i think this is a good idea but
with an l. c. d. screen you can
i think it should be oldest think from everything else because it's

then they can do everything i suppose because
some paper and present the next time the idea is to
that's better
little separate signal or so

have a little bit of a real problem with cute
i don't know about starts say
a take your them as of last meeting that was

we should close on your own notebook i
it's a little bit the losses the
just make a button on your t. v. and just hit

is that people or may have all the people
i read and i think that
as out what way you wanna hit that if you want we

novel is it mine my powerpoint presentation of
the no that's very important
but what not so important is audio settings to display settings and

to sell the just remembers and the channel it you're on most for example you want the
you can put in normal pen lights be chargeable to but they can also be recharged
covers as far as good

ideas which you posted and then at work folder really
or should it be programmable it should
maybe we should make "'em" bigger or whatever we're

covered that yes user
that make it much more complex so we really need to
it was the same is no telephone it's in my

the designs i was that you talking about beeps and about video screens but the material
so the symbols want fade maybe a little harder
maybe it's more expensive

them all we can make at once in one piece that is cheaper
'cause i'm pretty much accustomed or whatever here at least in general but
i think it's important you need me but i

and so the cover separately for example it's a slow
can it appears to really everyone say i'd
may have actually the cover separately so that was my

i mean if your remote control is lost how you gonna press where you gonna press the button
then maybe to have to do all the button and
i suppose because you see the t. v.s have that insight in this other jobs a somewhere so

speech recognition i think it's very hard because reselling
so we have to look into either you
top of these that's what i'm accustomed to

but should be exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or
because even if we're gonna do those covers everything what people really want that so we need to know in this phase because
i think i have a idea

in this for peace you can menu and you can it's like everything you want to decide on your t. v.
idea to have like sort of a maybe a base station it you put on the t. v. to be slightly to insert your remote into it
it's a very small i'm trying big

is work i showed is we have forty minutes to
is we have forty minutes to make how much time we have for the meeting anyway so
was imposing something so

but isn't that expensive than the entire package
that's a light possible
i do people actually want that to pay extra they want to pay for a rechargeable

welcome
just a text only not colour just a little text things you can

this project so
so you have a transmitter here for example see that

with them as we use we tested the two with that and then and we ask them
and we ask them to what's the remote to the for the feel like an what

both women and
we can hide those in a menu or something

that's pretty shocking
you could that's that's have that's not even the same a bad idea

you want the you wanted to be program for example you program
we have more technical specification

because the technical aspect that's be much covered we can do that
everyone wants to buy it so

there's nothing more annoying then faded symbols because you don't know
is it manageable is it easy

increase in the durability of thing so
we have to either that or make it integrate with with the docking station

up with what's possible for the budget
i mean those cost hardly anything i think and

now we're gonna let me
the a lot of technical parts in the remote control so

that's which buttons i want that's is our
is our remote control a universal or should it be

and how big easy remote control going to be i'll tell you why
i'll tell you why that's important to me

work that way i think we can just scroll said
cover we can make something that you can only remove this you know what i mean

said then i have read more integration of materials means less cost for the production them all we can
i like the covers does bring idea

you have infrared and into it
to look into either you could change both the buttons and the cover or just a cover or not

people now because our
it's a slow marking it could be applied so we

this is a new product and with this new product want to appeal to younger people which
your p. we define under forty you so

it's for in go with that anyway so and wanting should
and wanting should be important is that the corporate colour and slogan our recognisable which

it is just a slap on speaker with the button which sends out a small signals
a slap on sticker you mean as like a

maybe a little harder plastic or a special
one part it's it's a good thing to recharge it

if we make remote control with changeable covers then we can also make a cover for every language area that
you will be able to find it

i'm not it's hard to make that's
i'm not if it's possible

or just a cover or not which was easy
but so you can put your remote

phase because that's gonna be essential final design gonna come up with
the user

the user interface is pretty obvious thing it should be very
it's a speaker so for example

thing it should be very intuitive it's
so you can put your remote on flak for example

like you said the the sound options and the surround whatever the more complicated is to come
complicated is to come under one menu and

a double side a remote control or
we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either beep or flash into the thing with a little separate signal or

no but basic functions the functions
anyway we could do some work now on the design for example i mean

because usually the menu is the menu button is usable between different brands so is it a big ones the big brands
everything else because it's either it's both kind of maybe the shape can be a little

i assure you can press a research and if it's possible i
possible i think just them and the navigation

i think that our remote control should not look like any other for
grab the wrong one was the fault of the buttons is exactly the same point the labels of different is another

we get a general idea
another one here as you

that's fine think
these are competitions so i think people

in the middle it's usually a they're not
i think this is a brilliant product i would buy it myself

they wanted the deep
but for example of a class in your armchair or not see the flash

by accident but shouldn't be stepped away somewhere
i usually i see on top of these

mute button is that some way here is that used
you need me but i think it should be make it to put somewhere here

or if the volume selection
people are "'cause" into that it's

triangles in your hand drawn triangles but
that's premature people are accustomed to one

the city by yourself
as want to try to find out that i'm not

they want to pay for it
one but they want a rechargeable one

so what we have reached you have
what we have reached you have a think you have a thriller

and for the marketing or so

mine is so you show

where the is late the late or whatever so

no have much time anyway i or

again today functional design phase

to know each other a little thought so what your vision is and on this project so

i thought it that's new project requirements from project board so

so on and off of or those later but

but wanna start with the you did first so we can see

we can see what everybody can of worms and

and after that we can have the new requirements to share

with my computer so not the press station

i want to open the mice

the functional requirements that's that's very important for the user he wants to

he wants to

dump them at

dump them at that we use that it's not the slide because

not the slide because of one with them as we use

an what's important they

men so

so that's the most important things

on a novel

l. s. imports ten t. the text

on a scale of zero to ten they six and have and

that's not important is the channel selection that all

which channel selection

you know preference and preferences and

and beep to find your control so that

so that was a can that's the most people of a five that irritating when they cannot find their remote control so i think

so i think it's a beep to sounded to know you can find it and another

anyone to maybe an l. c. d. screen

to look at what's on every channel and what the when one of the

my favourite channels so i can and so

so i can said to my for quick to my favourite channel what

channel what i so

i so the remote more most c. or most see but mine preferences are for which channel so i

you program or you want it to recognise

i see you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel so i recognise

recognise

maybe it's easier to to say that but

i don't know it's manage moment

a little bit san of it's a little bit

let's just start with the method sound really

sound really easy what

easy what does the user do what does that remote control do but there are

the things i'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect because the technical

we can do that what goes

what goes wrong but the user gets the remote control

where's the remote control that was one of your

that was one of your ideas which you posted

work folder really good idea these

these are just the issues i come to some

those or we try to make it a little bit more clear also

also symbols tend to fade after while

presses the button

usually when you have a lot of buttons are small so you press

so you press more once remote control goes couple we or something like that so we have to

buttons should

that so we have to pay attention not to put too much too many buttons on the remote control and

and possibly also the side so more important buttons because i

they can bigger even more true

so this is what i had in mind in that tape to symbols locator a sound

it's a pretty much covered so

but more or less buttons easy some bigger buttons

so that's what i had in mind

this is not the final design this

the final design this is just a general idea of how i'd like to see be general idea

must say that

i was it has gone

i think it's really good idea

other aspect for the c. and we came up with what's possible

the minutes

the message that there are a few questions that need to be answered you already

you already talked about it that's which

it should be programme crime all then we need something like a mode that you can switch it "'cause" then the buttons

but the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already so keep in

so keep in mind that the thing that you keep think of it has to be built so

my first

costs have to check out how far can go with that normally a

normally a circuit board is made of fibreglass otherwise

and all remote controls work that way i think

maybe integrate them all to the circuit board

so we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again right this is what it look like

i think you have the power coming in they have like a switch

switch if you press it then some electrical charge goes into the process that things of a morse code that's how you should see

most would go to the amplifier then at the scene no sense

i live an indication like that you know that it's functioning

so we really need to have a look do we want that's

i don't have any personal preferences so far except

back to my thing

or changing a little like is that

like is that that it's not very popular anymore because of the

night that people will use teletext anymore or hartley so we can either

so we can either i don't think we should remove

but i don't think should be very should be one of the big buttons for example just put it somewhere

just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever so in port

so in port a more

a more are targeting young people now because

they like the way it looks too late functions so they're actually gonna spend a spend money on it

if we i think we should keep the logo in mind because

in mind because with colours you can have a lot of fashionable covers everything on it which seems everybody stay so

anything i think and people can even spend extra money i'm buying it covers

i'm buying it covers have an entire new remote control that they like to see which is

for that we could make it different than a basic design

make a basic one and may have

so that was my idea what we could do two pillars product or everyone so just

i if you came up with anything you meantime have to make a presentation was

i think we should lose the l. c. d. screen like you said i think

like you said i think for example it's you which i think is an issue which is it consumes

which is it consumes batteries like l. i think it takes

i think it takes a lot of lot power it costs a lot

costs too much to fabricate so

so on a tight budget here

it's even possible that

have to check that i'm not

final compromise in that but

i think that that because very simple thing to implement just make a button

on your t. v. and just hit the button and beach somewhere think it's

think it's easy to implement

should go for that and speech recognition

if you want we wanna but on the television

then i'd like to know now if we want universe remote or not because that's

i think is universal i think we should go for universal because

people i think euros remote controls be possible

i think we're targeting everyone so right

me but i know what to look for

hard because reselling across multiple countries so

i don't see a rainy and people speaking one two whatever

that the technologies are really super so that

so that is a problem in implementing those

it's not mature technology i think it takes one

i think it takes one memory and everything in a remote control set

idea but it's just not i don't think the market right for that

nothing it should be in for men in a remote control yet so we have

why should you should look into the in into the material so we'll durable

plastic or a special but then maybe to have

far as especially for older people that they can read it in or nine which

we're not we're starting older people remember that

people remember that everything we targeted

that's a problem with that would the text then

same a bad idea i

that's a good the bad idea

i know that the buttons are like an old telephone on once leave so

leave so you don't have to change a whole cover we can

telephone it's in my

which was easy

work after that so this you reach c. d.

speaker so for example about a remote control last week within t. v. a. was it

buttons in you know i do it does at first a

and maybe a second level menu for the advanced things or maybe just stick

things or maybe just stick "'em" under menu like you said the

under one menu and i could it's pretty

it's pretty in this for peace you

is it take that technically possible to send a signal to television and then pops up a menu because we're working

so we're going to work with that

it's an in built menu isn't it yes

i'm not if it's impossible there's a

but the cover it

it's an idea to overcome these issues because

but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons for example you have a sony

for example you have a sony t. v. they have the buttons what function if you have a force only have one i prefer c. d.

functions the functions which are not frequently used because if we use a

because if we use a universal remote control are going to have most buttons on it so

they can use we do that with either the old remote controls they hit the thing but

you can you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of t. v.s i think

that might be broken

i think there's a i think there is a standard for example between because

i have a universal remote control i can

i can use the menu button so i think

so i think i assure you can

them and the navigation is very basic should be

the television presence if you old remote control is broken when you buy hours then you should be able to get everything out of the television that's it that's what i was you use

the menu i think it's possible to sway have

to sway have to then

any other for instance the sony makes all the remote controls exactly the same for all devices you always

maybe the shape can be a little different it's

i have some ideas

different it's a little more curves or whatever

that's your decision

and with different colours

is we have forty minutes to

for example i mean what a one to one of the trial

and erase all the others

that will smooth inside

see that you know what would be handy i think the

handy i think the buttons should be the channel buttons should be on the run it on

and the light

the run it on that

there's always on top of the controls are there should

so you have to be up channel hm the

the volume do we want that are zones over to

this is what people or customs do so

but this is just a general idea maybe the menu

we could make a combination the goes beep in that you that some light so

i thought up for deaf people for example so

just a light on it or

so we have be basic channels we've got here

got here the power button somewhere over here

be you shouldn't press by accident but

i think that's gonna work

think that's gonna work

what would you like to write

and then put it here for example to

in your reading format you always read

you always read from the top to the bottom of it

on top to bottom that's true you should think

true you should think about the power but should be on top is

be on top is first thing is that trade on to power

trade on to power button on top

are they i think it should be at the bottom somewhere

is that used often the mute button

mute to design of

it's not that important now

it to put somewhere here

you i think this should be channels and

and r.s

i'm a cousin to the channels being on top

channel i got this to

remote that you don't have to buy new batteries it every

for that as it's one part it's

maybe should work but could be possible as

but could be possible as one with rechargeable batteries for example we have

just put a light batteries that are rechargeable because it's

because it's it's very annoying

i'm not it's if it's expensive but just take a look

at it because it might be a very good idea is if

you can make a device that i'm not how does it's possible to that you can put in normal batteries which are so but

you're the remote also can act as a recharger so then you can

would be better like like a p. d. a. hand-held you can just put it in the a christian it charges itself we don't

so you could put that on the t. v. for example it could be

that is possible that's true

very flat we very small it's a very small

we got to use redundant recharges for example i think it's very

for example i think it's very sad

how much are the costs a lot that's better

it's just an idea we have to find out if it's possible

but that was not that i have asked

so i think people will pay they were wanted to pay for comfort this is comfort

this is comfort

can we save this or

but it's a we insert the
