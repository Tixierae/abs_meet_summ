the button because are always people who are using it but i don't think should
the mute button to people use that of "'cause" i'm

where is the remote control we've all had at once
where's the remote control that was one of your
is our remote control a universal or should it be
the a lot of technical parts in the remote control so
that's is how it is done and all remote controls
and all remote controls work that way i think
say i'd have to i think you know have to make under remote controls make a basic one and
a remote control or i think that's useful
i think that our remote control should not look like any other for

presses the button
usually when you have a lot of buttons are small so you press
that's true but it's only has to do so when you press a button that it's lost
if you'd you press a button you can see it right i'm

it but that's rules out universal remote control
then i'd like to know now if we want universe remote or not because that's
because if we use a universal remote control are going to have most buttons on it so
i have a universal remote control i can

shall we also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote that
we can look at the possibilities for an l. c. d. and
just look at the possibilities and because it's

what i have a little preview on the remote control to use some channel
do we put the volume control and the channel control here or do

there's always on top of the controls are there should

remote or not because that's that the missed anything i'm gonna do now
but they can also be recharged with the remote would why

so you press more once remote control goes couple we or something like that so we have to
i mean if your remote control is lost how you gonna press where you gonna press the button
i know what i'll already said just and they are the remote controls are always lost but it's

there are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear so either
that so we have to pay attention not to put too much too many buttons on the remote control and

so you can put your remote on flak for example

because you don't know which channel is this button so possibly
i think the channel buttons should be in the centre channel buttons should be used
channel buttons should be used stick together for example here in the sections "'cause"
so we have channel buttons here and just wrong

for you have to make it will decision between the part if you when you reverse remote control that it should do what people usually do with their t. v.s not the very complicated settings they can use we
but a big remote control probably not something with people would like

searches for the button
i don't think we should remove the button because are always
just make a button on your t. v. and just hit
have to do all the button and especially the ones that are the popular buttons so those are was very
buttons in you know i do it does at first a
i thought maybe we should move the buttons and then
want so then i can work with some buttons where to put it
just play a little with this buttons
would i would say have to step we're buttons or else and

where would we want be teletext button "'cause" we
a teletext button just make need to go
