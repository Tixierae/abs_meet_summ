we designed it to be good looking
we designed it to be good looking at all
i i think so it's it's the point at what's the use of course if you look at the design and the colours and everything and all that

titanium and has the titanium corps of course the look
i mean this is the same titanium it looks
titanium it looks like it

i agree with the l. c. d. screen you if it's
but i think you'll agree that the that we that now we have this screen it's very not practical the had to consider this after we've designed entire thing

which of course parts back actually because
which is made which is also part of the back and part of the titanium titanium part
the back is of course to be titanium and
to a because the titanium back

when i look at it when i look at this side view i think what i have that in my head it's terrible it
it's not be looking at looks remain
looking at looks remain the same

a desktop and then one is used to draw
it might be useful for drawings i agree on that

but would i would then we have to lose the l. c. d. screen
l. c. d. screen but i think you could better change that i came too hard kind of plastic looking like titanium then lose the l. c. d. screen because

the first question is is the size good-looking because normal
like that of course but i think they all did they think that did that came look of it is also i think it was a good for them so
people so i think it's very good looking and not only for
four i think it if you look
look that's the costs at this point
and then you have read each shoe prints will be looking dom remotes that and that no one would buy
i haven't looked one time directly at the camera that

but we'll have to design much more be cost
design but we don't really considered cost so
design and then you get the costs we had to do with creativity

for as far as i can see three of us agree and
of us agree and one wins

why don't we replace the titanium it's plastic call what type they mean the
they mean the titanium coloured plastic
we use plastic
so you we use unfortunately like a yellow colour of plastic
so titanium coloured plastic for the back
and i'm plastic times do we know
no wichita or plastic i don't know

menu for the l. c. d. screen
you if it's your palm like this you can what's what's screen and if you have to play it
because if you have a screen on it you wanna look at the screen
we need to have the l. c. d. screen
but you can better damped l. c. d. screen
at a team or don't l. c. d. screen but
screen because you have lots of functions it in a two
that it would have been useful if i could showed is on the screen

the device easy to find if you lose it
is a device easy to use yes we have

you have to use the advanced chip if you have to l. c. d. screen
but if you have a regular chip you can't have the l. c. d. screen

and we're using different colours of
using different colours of course of the launch we use the basic up the colours and
fruits that's true but do we have the the spark a fruity colours of course and
plastic is already in colour i think
