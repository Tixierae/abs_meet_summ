so i have to fill in
these are very important documents of course these drawings
it looks like and
that's a bird but what kind of
but what kind of them
you have to push harder
just the child
and then a new blank document
when you choose a new colour and then you then why also for mart
and the other fifty and
what we can sit down because
a new remote and you don't buy remote if you don't have anything to to control with that
because we look at competitors and if we
triangle shape but that's not a very recognisable
ovals like
one of our aims just that it has to be original and trendy so

then we'll look at the project plan from real reaction
different colours and different then why it's the line the bigness of fitness so
big bird
you're standing in front of it i can see
there's no way but we don't know what's exactly the isn't it isn't dollars but children euros
maybe it's important to make it compatible with the d. v. d. player
they would be a idea yes
so you can you should television and you d. v. d. player with the same remote control
furthermore it's important to make its acceptable for the whole world for different cultures maybe because we onto
are we could make more oval or something and then

so size does matter and
so every time we will do some individual work get meeting talk about it and then i'm going to the next phase
you know it but it does work sometimes
it's just like more paint so it's
so that's the test it
the nine all but
don't count on it
you want to erase it
pads and i one hand has to be here so the other day
it's new

and then we can individually do or things and then we'll
and it's worse just like a ball pen is it just
yes i'll eraser like
as it it works
this speaks for itself
we going to try it
it's a document and
we could use another form or shape or colour that kind of things

the opening and then
and then we'll meet each other but then we
there's also a different colours and different
can i call
colour and i knew when you choose
and if we pick up the good things about that and you deny design
has to be different and familiar at the same time

and friendly so size does
or you just click on the folder and you open that everything you put in it with your laptop so
and officially this is my idea so
i have spent all right
what kind are losing time that
we're losing time but
of the first meeting is just a bit use it as an up with the meeting each other and

but open it on the smartboard so we can all see
so i'm pregnant so i
eraser like
i think it's it's important to look at the remote controls of our competitors
no but events
no but young people want something different than

chief i'm the industrial design
it's a rabbit
looks very right
it looks amazing
no i don't it's just a bird
why do i have to do the difficult task other

the school the kickoff meeting so
i was a marketing design
we can take notes and
less some remarks about the current remote controls
single you can make it a triangle shape but

and then you go to formats i think and current
and current colour and i knew
super pick
so that's we're going to use when we need it i
they see this exercise

we're we want to say that's twenty five euros intonation think there's no way but we
now our ideas
try to merge them into one universal remote control on our corporate
so it doesn't to become too complicated with too much buttons
but you still have to know what's the remote and that's another

have an a dinner
and then we'll close the meeting and then we can
can you select then you can draw anything you want it's a bit of a
i hope this was part of the assignment or not your no but that's

i want to be original so when i say
and what their the rest are also were same so when you open a note that you wanna use get your things you
we just to have a list and here
it's a bit of a child is you have to write it's not

as i just showed there's a project management folder a project documents folder on the desktop it just works
it just works exactly the same as a bit or you
it's what does it does take we can
grossly there

i'm to restate sum it up
so now the next one there
and then save it in start and blank documents
and i think the people will buy our remote already have some experience with remote so

a very good it's it's quite easy
i feel comfortable now they see this exercise
i that's terrific
i feel eighties

user interface
i think it's for the resembles the animal drawn by
what kind of them was that then

do so there's not a very much for all i'll show you the
i'll show you the tools we have here so that we can we use them then
but it's quite important that it's just

we have these two smartboards
this is it drawing board
you have these difference functions on the board you can

pen is it just
of course but it doesn't work anymore
maybe you should try to write on the big white as it

wonderful
we can delete but we don't do we have
you can you select then you

looks like at this from sesame street
that's it but one big happy
but one big happy family no then

it doesn't are all circle set that easy
but we have do we have to name the specifics p. c.'s of the bird
then that the serious

just the child is better
our profit aim is worldwide fifty million euros
except if we deliver it's together with a t. v. d.

no first
first and
blank

line live in you can choose a
when you change it
just save it

and erase things
super
good for the group spirit

you are that's just start i've
you have the data already i think so

i've made a presentation
we are designer so we have to have a more a smart board so

we'll discuss about our first ideas about the project and then
something different than it is

or things and then we'll get back here so
a sort of make my know why read that

a trendy it's also for young people we
people we have to just to make it morgan

and it has to be and then the right the right buttons on the right place at those kind of things
i haven't to be three stages in going

right your favourite animal
so i'm to going to have to draw can room but i'm

yes are for your favourite so
most people do

i just said it's not my idea but i'm pregnant
but i'm pregnant and officially

better because the system
it's just a bird

i think it's mouse for a rat
it's a high powered

i'm the industrial designer
recognise i thought about like most a remote controls are along box shaped single you

say to start a new save
maybe i'll put in the project folder when i'm done they're just

i start a new black the top of a blank documents
these are whiskers you know

he deliberately control so i am all we do that in each word for
it speaks for itself

work with
it's miles nicely

the line width is to stick with a
we want to keep it a cost of twelve and a euros so

yes alright it's a cat
it's a cat

because presentation can we can take notes
get a good points try to merge them

no mine the buttons have to have to have international recognisable buttons and
monday remote sense too much buttons i think

and maybe we do i do we even have more than just a d. v. d. player don't we
so we can keep in mind

we also just the release the t. f. t. so
so but that's kind of standard the television so it also works on that

we need to the keep it consistent with other that
but it's has to be usable

from the way my to speak

so it's in the project documents because

documents because that's what we can find

so is the opening will

with two design a new television remote control you have the data

so when i say a new design

in going to a functional conceptual and the detailed design

so you can make word excel everything

things you can throw this is

so you have a pen and it's worse

take we can you can save a file so if

a file so if we'd we have to save everything don't throw anything

don't throw anything away

just we can start a new one and we just go on and don't try anything we just to

write it's not as fast as you were you know it but

so will i going to draw a animal on the board know my idea

know my idea yes

can room but i'm going back they're not going to i'm just

to i'm just a going to draw a be so i don't know where

be so i don't know where what i'm gonna do the nine all

no but that's part of the time and not your personal enjoyment

to start

i hope our industrial design that is better because the

no have a few lax

pulp i

i i still make it a town now

they've got in this world

i'm amazed much or drawing skills

it's a very painful but i think so

and now where are in this design i can i draw it's the most favourite animal

is a very important

we have to save everything so now

so you should to try it but

but just black

is the plane

so we lucked use a new colour and in new pen wife so we can all see it's no

is not like in paint line live

in you can choose a work with

and i control

you can stick it

it's a pig

i think it's a pretty right now

it is an office

save it and start a new blank documents

so i'd depends a exactly calculate how much we have to sell we

so keep that in mind when we talk about our materials of the and the marketing research

now what then we'll we can sit down and discuss what do we think about our current remote controls first

first ideas about design about in a in the market etcetera

i didn't have to prepare anything about but it's not

but it's not it's not might have to talk about the experience with current remote controls but

on our corporate site so a new d. v. d. player we're gonna produce maybe it's

because we onto we want to settle for fifty million

yes fifty million designed to our profits so

so a lot of people have to be able to use it

numbers and then that every culture and people are the card you can recognise

make a note and then

i also think we should not that too many buttons monday remote

you don't use the half of them that's another culture

culture intonation

maybe you could make one button to switch between d. v. d. player and t. v. and make the other

and make the other buttons and multifunctional or something

we should maybe compatible that's with everything we use

in stereo us the audio is lisa

it's an it's a new remote and you

disable we'll have to be recognise i thought about

we can use it as a game pads and i

it we already one of our aims
