and no we put it in but that would be handy
but that would be handy your this the
valuation
can i draw here or
lose it might it is no hard to do
hard to use alright
now material isn't that
i think it's a three
are the features that might phones
feature and that you can change channels feature and that you can
you have channel features but you have the
and a half we
feature it's something special
so we don't exactly need a single we don't need a curve it's possible to

we made a prototype
to use it for would put an hour and an extra button and we can
that's the logo off the
is remote control fits in us
first question is the design fancy
let's leave it
that it's hard to know it is
they said maybe i could ask one of you to sell it in so that i
this one is curved like this right if it's
curve you made notes curved like that's

'kay my task was this time to put up a questionnaire
but which you can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we can my requirements from the of the users if i made
questionnaire was seven point scale from one to seven from two false like question
like question is more big enough we can say it's true or false by steps
but just make the back of this part a bit bigger so that it in a student
so that it in a student or
i'll have to rate is
false is seven
i think this is easy enough think
this is easy enough think i think the options buttons are not but the easiest way to

this and remotes
but i think you should make it one scale with one being good and seven being then because otherwise
i think it's a three
you can use it so the mean you could make it a three
it does everything that doesn't function
a remote control may
remote control may be sold to younger people
no i don't think there's a because of colours
we have the colours to have
those are our front it's not the colours

of the screen so it's very in your
in your we use it doesn't the coming at eighteenth see "'cause" if you put
that's we about single course but it also
course but it also make what colour not as one single colour what would like thing
too flexible because it has l. c. d. screen
you could call it
that might phones feature and that
or make it abundantly you can see

would it isn't wood
you can make a print on rubber and you have
that's a as a one isn't rubber
it is this a it's a six
i think it's a lower numbers or better because
l. c. d. screen scroll
or maybe stick to but
that it does this have now you have a black one

it's an idea
at least the most useful remote control of are to be manufactured because
in it as a more fancy functions not really many features or something
i think two or three
you in a three
three i'd
say three so do we do is that it or

let's leave it still is
still is a innovative
'cause there's an l. c. d. screen and then microphone
it's fun rubber
it was a big requirement of the old people
l. c. d. i. l. ski to touch screen as feature
the microphone is a feature

i think it's a three
to use it has to be easy to find all right away i'd i
away i'd i think if you have the button at the right i don't think you can find the option button that easy
but you don't have to use the button right you can't touch it
they don't want be extra options right
hard but
but a hard the hard to use is good so

we have many questions
if you put a co workers are not able
to satisfy younger people
'cause everybody's a critic recall and
feature and that you can change the volume this feature which can
which can change options of the remote to something
and then you have the audio settings channel settings video settings

how did we worked together and what are the results
and in the middle the mute
i used to powerpoint
i was in nebraska
i have a problem maybe
with two result somewhat course

and we have evaluation
quick i think it's i
no we don't have push button
because when you push a we want as it possible to see
is for properly for units

'cause if you put it on the top you always get see the options menu
as people regularly read from last top to write that sir
so it's hard to it i
this a it's a six you think
or if you're a six years old your demands

of and is it easy enough to use
because we designed it to be very fancy set
but it looks like would it isn't
so then is that it is almost room so too
it's that happened above also the bay

so all fancy
i have to agree all colour colours or doubles never did that much now solid
i don't know whether older people use it but
you could make it a three and
it's not the colours or maybe stick

because you want to make it rather flexible but not too flexible because
is that off just finding out what i can means on a button
and you can navigate easier because
do that because i draw the
but now button supplements we don't have a button supplements

you are and it did you do something with the evaluation criteria go and we have
a. t. and a half
know what i feel would be if it is a new
be if it is a new feature it's

any questions so far
it's an idea so
that's a single curve me
and you have the data

this the one number two numbers that so we know that the patients
take a harder look
i remember
curved double curves of it and see it a three dimensional but isn't three-dimensional

better indicator
no the single curve idea was
that's i way if you add that to
i'm gonna works

project manager where you think
so if you flip it like this
years and
true is one false

remote control is sort of colours the different step me different target groups
not exactly but it has some games on it or something like that but
but it's for remote control i think it would satisfy that means the speech possibility
easy volume up button

to have the buttons are not that much
a two it this in order to have some we had to
we have to count something so we have to think
is that a battery

one of the it's the colours
and a menu was to say that this table is easy to use
so we're going to erase feature or something
but the excel sheet in that

no i have a my my information so
and it wasn't to manager
but you should direct
integrated scroll wheel and push button because when you push a

and then we have to look at something which is less that's fine
that's fine and aspect where we can afford what we have designed if we can
that's pretty

we made a prototype for
the the low
and the next question my god

for start with the overall
it's very fancy i think if he ever seen a remote
now we're fixing alright

this is about the total remote control could maybe three
this is harder to
that those are features

just example colour so
colour so as one of the colours
first question

mark from could be just a minor the whole on the button
but that's fun to just l. c. d. screen you can have text
so which number are we going to fit in

we also made some ideas about how the options many would work using
he was a scroll button
side and so

we can modify that later
but you have the screen features are the features the
the average

to make any comments the next
we have sample speaker or
but isn't three-dimensional isn't

or at least it should look like it and
seven means true
to powerpoint so

i'd say two or less skill
then because otherwise we count calculate anything from the results
it'll make them in different colours so

bit harder but if you touch the options and
let's hear it too
most because we option to

up with anything because i'll think it maybe it's easy to use it
you could touch option of the second
he said that is a

can't touch it
right i think they'll be quite a net do with their expectations
on the front so that you that's

are very enthusiastic about your own designs that
so i don't have to calculate anything because of these missiles good
the curve that's a very

because it's not it's not that they've called you say
the speech possibility to colour
to know and the screen

i think a sense this has to be something like isn't overwhelms
because we designed for
you can see the remote control to the armour

we're getting paid we getting paid
a spongy because of hard rubber
hold it was hard to lose

the video use a spongy that's a as a one
yes but if you few features
i think it's easy to use their regular remote control because

now you have a black one of
easier because of the with the you have to push the arrows and with a normal t. v. remote
i think that would be quite hard to learn to use you know not convinced

because was they did a little bit see in our shared project documents folder i don't know if
no that's just one big document so

i don't know if everybody put their own documents in the right for which is for the
normal scroll-wheel

which is for the detailed design meeting
on move this one

time yes i have it on myself
the numbers which is to use it for would put

the detailed design meeting
only what happened to the single curve let's talk about something

that already in i'm still going to take some minutes and
we have once we want that have to couple it have to go at all

and if i'm right you two are going to give a prototype presentation
a look on that and we're going to calculate the production cost or if they are

as one of the colours we would like to see you know about that
and then evaluate himself

big so people know what's there and
an l. d. for you to their deaths

using scroll buttons sides but
remote settings of

and dropdown menu or pull out menu comes out and
comes out and you get and get options become available for example it's easy settings remote settings etcetera so

and in a all the goes visible
how about that and not that bad

a button that one yet it has a name
of only make also yellow one

we know that the patients out and
we do have to fill in this colour know counts

like it and the options the teletext
buttons so i

and i just missed when i was time we are stands for
our age

methods
although the special colour especially

bling
he's you make the side where he's he's

add that to them
young means sixteen to forty years an l. d. for

suppose that
that's a one i think that's enough and you know

it's going to be a little bit sketchy at the top
for the search function

because they write all your screen
solar cell now it to a battery

no they're not but there are they are easy to fight
they are a lot easier to find and and then on the regular remote controls where you have

a two year two three and
two three and what you think

controls lie as you can see the screen out and
one or two batteries and no

you don't have all the other options always when you screen so it's i think
maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use

three
three i see us

jimmy more
remotes all four the buttons

a seven is that this
one two three

or false
scroll options

but then when you switch it does come up
we can use "'em" spongy

we have time
we have no the money

it's very spongy all that sort of
that's you've got features that don't exist in excel sheet

i'd say it's not the most spongy thing
all that sort of a spongy because of hard

you can break
is good so it should just a question to be hard to lose it's difficult to lose

to manage
to manage to make it a two

to not lower
that's pretty good

let's see you didn't ask to save that in that already
but i am willing to try it

and i'm not about put in the project a look on that
or if they are under or act twelve euro fifty

let's hope so we're going to
i think it's still might them documents folder

something so we have to think about some things we do have to fill
we have the scroll wheel right

count it you get excel to that
the number of

a battery one battery right
no solar cell won't no

an advanced chip
we already on mine

single curved is like this it that's the only
it that's the only curve you made notes

we have to a know it with six points
it again push it you have to tap the options we know button here and then scroll down with today with the but

so welcome

welcome everyone as

as you may have noticed i

created separate folders because was

safe in the folder so it as project

big document so you can use that where it is and we have

not main documents this time

the detailed

we're finally getting somewhere hopefully what are

go and we have a correct agenda and

if we can comments the final part which use the production or project evaluation how did we

and what are the results are happy or

are happy or we have those

finance will be better now i'd like if

to help them there is a

it's a fresh folder and the

and the screen light blue

this the scroll button on the microphone on on the side here on the anti r. and r. logo

anti r. and r. logo just

i just i just an idea about how to win that could also be possible

that's the place are going to be that's

it should make it a bit big so people know what's

the function it doesn't really have to be some a bit of course mark from could be

you push the scroll button and it's that's out

so you can scroll than two scroll up button

button is to see is

here just push it in

in the menu comes out like this and

but you could also touch it so that

touch it so that it comes out and

it comes out and use the scroll being as which of things

there's also i see that we make the small menu the options menu become available one pressing the scroll but in any

in any opportunity to use the teletext they were

teletext they were which is used this is still be used everything

still be used everything there it's very handy to put it not under the options menu in but

so the separate button for

a separate button

that's true should use the teletext side and

i forgot

this is that tells all interface of the l. c. d. screen

erase it but it's the button where you can switch channels that means when

that means when you are wanting you go to you can off you go to five you can go back to one with a button

previous but

it has a name and

it's quite large

and this is the you know the on off or crawl the standby

yes exactly that's the teletext option menu isn't taking the much it's taking much part of the screen so it's very

i will put back on the on a agree

it's a that right now is only a rubber

i would've recognise the for the right course

"'cause" our age

the evaluation criteria

full screen

if i made my job

i imagine

one means i should not true seven means

that's really important things off or fact are a form of this year is are is remote control

is it in innovation of and

is the design fancy enough

it looks fancy especially with the green colour and the curves which we decide it's

i would i smartboard i

my for one time

so it would be something like this one site that little bit of a curve you're right

so it's also a very handy if you make a site curve way to make the remote control very thin at the bottom at a bus am i supposed to make it

make it a rustic on the top because

on the top because not stop it has the screen which

the screen which takes a in some space and

space and the batteries can be located over there so

with two berries the whole but and then top and if you're holding it quite a lot of think

i think and the battery should be in here because that's

in here because that's just nothing so if you put

what we have two rates you think that

'cause otherwise i think

have to rate is have a snuff true is one

so all fancy enough means does it's comes to younger people and elderly people

a if you don't make it green then the other people like that

now solid design

i think that special because the microphone and the l. c. d. screen also for a new

for a new thing

fancy all of people

that's true so once very fancy

it's it's it'll that's strange we have

it'll that's strange we have to just that or something

so one right so it's a very short

right so it's a very short is and that's true

if he ever seen a remote control like this

so it's fancy

that's fancy enough

one to that doesn't matter

to that doesn't matter that much to make

and a scroll is rubber so it's

also the buttons are easy to find it was a

we use i don't know where you search

are all the buttons easy to find not only these buttons all buttons

you options are a little bit harder but

it's easier than the regular a remote control

and you use these buttons the most

controls where you have to find out what which sign or i can means on a free button so you have to

so you have to use the manual to understand most

i think it's it's just to at least

it's not perfect but

you can touch it

you can touch options

instead of the options

but you have three then you have here is written option then you get teletext button right

option of the second one

it's the box below it had

my god

it's different

as easy to use as for a number of elderly people

for young people i think it's easy to use

yellow or

in the entire may i

also if you are sixty years old

because i have the regular controls lie as

so it's i think is really easy to use you want

you want these options to

as for you for the older people

as you if texas as usual we will do one of those things in your hand

no but we're going to make this for all kind of people so it has

and would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition

of people so it has to be

i think it is it's a region menu

that they've called you say required to do the to the speech recognition they should

channel one channel four

they should a question and the answer and that i've seen

and that i've seen it does the speech recognition

maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them

is all the people count

also to but the seventies

to but the seventies

i would also say three

two or three two or

the look like would like something i think

so three because you want

hard to lose it is and is easy to find

you can lose it if you see assault if for some sort of thing

if for some sort of thing you they didn't adjust the set the microphone and then you lose it then you have lost it

you can lose it might it

it is it are no i think this is a two or three

it's hard to do so then is that it

the bay when you scroll away and back it will be normal

remember

numbers or better because we design it for young people especially

younger people it has

a critic recall and they wanted a lot of features on this thing

i suppose

i think they like the speech

you could call to know

yes three features l. c.

i'd say that features

those are features

and younger people usually use remote controls put on the volume they're not turn up the volume

touch it i should

and features

touch it i should i think it's one

you have all buttons on it which is like a microphone extra l. c. d. screen extra scroll i think it's fair

i'd say three so

but the logo was on the front so

x. marks but and

remote control because when you push on the options menu you get the the various options intel explains entirely explain

you can never

that's that oriented

know not convinced that's goes for

i different

different

that's goes for i think it would

but just to this one three and if you want

remote most have to use so it's pretty good

to the average is a two that is

we can be happy

it's like "'em" but this is fine

that was our evaluation she

the next part might be a little bit difficult to do in a group but

the big as all we are going to look at that finance and

finance and i have a excel sheet to do that

greta i know i

we're good and evil enough we're going to redesign that we have to that's

that we have to that's a very quick i think it's

fifty five euros

folder think

we're gonna still going to be retired o'clock i

i would hope that's you've got features

the microphones

no they be a good script scrap it

as was the l. c. d. screen

sell it in so that i can also take minutes and

and maybe the r. can use that thing to count the numbers functions

dialects that i quite a bit

know counts a number of functions because for every

functions because for every button you have to pay and

button you have to pay and there are different screenshot so a different screen so

do i have any i'll do that because i draw

and no one battery but too small battery

but it's more about the energy source and do use a hand

and do use a hand dynamo battery kinetic or solar cells

a little battery do we do is that

no hundred number and

electronics simple chip advanced

or the what we also have sample speaker to

what was single what

what are we eight

we have double curved

single on a single curved double

isn't curved in a

it's not going to work or people we have rubber

or just fill it in

right if it's goes like this

rubber

although of course like that and it had to call for

all kinds that as a or rubber

wheel right if integrated

if integrated know

i don't work

l. c. d. display

we don't have a button supplements

we don't have any buttons so i

we could lose the curve

i will also curve

we could lose the scroll wheel we could make a just

we could make a just a regular scroll wheel

which can push it so you have

i think it will be or best bet

so normal scroll-wheel

and i think we should lose the curve

i think we should square the sample speaker is for

no the curve
