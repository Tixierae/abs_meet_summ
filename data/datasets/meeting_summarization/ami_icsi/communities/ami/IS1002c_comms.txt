because we have a product market and
so what i'm saying is from my perspective i don't have a product to market right now
so a new product i need a product
i need a product to market and i just

and need something the market about this think we're
till the last thing so what we need to know all in terms of marketing and project manager and are there any other questions that we need to answer night before you guys and one bulb s.
that's why the scroll needs to be really the last

buttons or do we want it for the two scroll field do we want to go l. c. d. do want
for it you scroll button and the menu isn't it
and i see the scroll as a great mechanism for surfing it's that one button to

we can use a scroll-wheel with an integrated push button and l. c. d.
know what i see with a scroll wheel is everybody has buttons so from

to it i do like the idea the scroll wheel
if i had it on your t. v. images are we can really fly can have that a can't have the scroll wheel which i think to really idea that would sell me on a little then maybe

because the scroll wheel comes up quite a cost

my name is in the amount i i see it on off button
see it on off button a sheep
so taken that why you know of the of the problem but rubber buttons are the more reliable it's the
on it doesn't have to say the on button not exactly the details but do we have
it is it's one extra button you say
button you say programme start and then type in "'cause" you still
so if there's a button for each side
still white then the buttons to
then the buttons to like what buttons bit

so it'll look inside your it really all looking remote control you've got
make a remote it doesn't look like remote

that's not a scroll wheel
and does anybody really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should be that's that off and forth
my question is what would the scroll-wheel do
quite understand that scroll-wheels of the quite expensive to make
be lose the scroll wheel in or out
or do we really need the scroll wheel as because the scroll wheel
so the scroll wheel in or out
for me i think the scroll-wheel actually may not be so bad i don't know
that was my intuition of a scroll wheel would be

more reliable it's the ones that put a lot would allow us to market our product as being you know last one to damage and more resistors
"'cause" "'cause" right now i don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we have a product
and from talking the mike user we have we can market it more expensive product now
that's it is a marketing standard i need something to market to make this product unique
again i think it's the more unique miss you can bring the product be easier it is i believe me to market
because what it one other thing for marketing about this product is this is the last one you ever need to by your television that one of the marketing

display or multiple scrolling wheels
and it didn't say specifically but i have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel in the multiple scroll wheels
no we can do multiple scroll wheels but

so if we can market it in terms of that and the other
maybe in terms of marketing is that gonna make an offer that seems to justify the cost

or maybe you could like have a smell or am i you know you push a button
i you know you push a button minutes put sense think you can
'cause a television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push a button so can

it to be the market is senses not it's not a relative we can are we can
i'm a little bit stuck right now and that what what is it to them what the market and it with that special
that when we have something like a cradle or something if that's it is a marketing
and i just whatever pride you get put together will find a way to market that i'm not concerned but
but you're the thing to target market is because
market is because i'm not our target market and a student
market and a student but
so you can market that depending on that

and you've got all these buttons which kind of press down little rubber not be ease into these little holes that where do we
what he actually had to press the button to make it recognise so if you press and then
but the ones you just press the off button
