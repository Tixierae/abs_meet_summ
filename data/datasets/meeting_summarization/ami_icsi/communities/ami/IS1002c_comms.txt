there's all the camera
if the t. v. is working that's
that's it i mean if somebody
and fighting for the remote would that be fun anymore and
be fun anymore and i think that's the things we wanna keep
what he actually had to press the button to make it recognise so if you press and then
but the ones you just press the off button
losing it will a small the remote control one side because
but i think we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that so
so we're suggesting in as a scroll-wheel thing for the volume
size or something looks good and
good and not too proud to get lost
so and two functional requirements or trendwatching
no trend watching a year's
and from talking the mike user we have we can market it more expensive product now
give me a higher price give me some new technology
don't give me the same thing and everybody else putting up there on the shelf it's at the same price
function wise what does that do they
so what would you imagine it being
the channels think it might be kinda need to be able to do it like that
but then that surely that depends a lot on the t. v. because some t.
think it has the same exact functionalities two buttons
i think is you know the there's so many people are they're surfing or television servers and i see
and i see the scroll as a great mechanism for surfing it's that one button to
but if we have the option of scrolling chip tick it at any particular speed or the option of jumping direct so i can

you press the senators
so you've got here's a transistor in this amplifies your signal
double curved i believe that the tech department in there and there's a message to me that they're referring to the number of curves in the bottom i have no idea
i think we get some exclusivity in that you know we
because i think as far as durability it's not a big
maybe that's close
but you guys are the ones that have to ultimately create a product within cost
i a little tiny speakers gonna be quite cheap it's not gonna
i really think that's a really thing for surfing
just say no though it you did bring up a point which is very valid is all i. t. v.s war the t. v.s will respond exactly the same some of organic
the same some of organic at a slow switching see you may
see you may like to walk like fifteen channel changes in it'll be like flip
so i can goal presuming i have on my television something that tells you what channel one i can scroll directs from channel five to channel thirty two
the television tells me what channel it's on wanna change it so
so i don't know that really that's gonna be a problem "'cause" a television
'cause a television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push a button so can
so can we create a kind of interface within a scroll system image they wanna say
image they wanna say
i think i know what you might be getting it or or

a piece too much it's gonna be to have a
it's actually a normal thing because you
you didn't have actually any concept of what the differences between a simple chip an advanced chip
trend watching a year's trend watching
that's what i understand so i will
i don't say special
i save it's a different than what i'm
than what i'm looking for is marketing its give me something different it
something different it give me a lower price give me a higher price
that i'm not concerned but
my personal preferences forcing the product on the idea of the the case they'd be talk to parents it to charge it we can target like environmentally
mark it's easy to differentiate of rubber that's
because the whole product gonna need to be more durable that's because you're not going
maybe in terms of marketing is that gonna make an offer that seems to justify the cost
it should be really simple signal so
and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing "'cause"
i think what would be used like them i'm like this where it's maybe you know a digital we right where it's contest into it you know the same
why it'll tell you when you flip the channel on the t. v.

and what we may be able to do and i think this may be the best option is to combine some a couple of these my recommendation
so and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber so i'll but
that makes sense
that is one thing with a button that you can use
but i think yesterday it's still i don't
know what to say when i see what i see the one i see the product i don't i wanna buy i see so many of "'em" out
that's no that's not a design that's just
i like the idea of the scroll make in
do we go basic or do we go for features
expensive but and the other hand i mean it is an alternative if you think that's gonna sell some you know if the if
you know if the if we're gonna make of the extra cost by any extra sales i think maybe it's worth it to do it but
in that you know we got something that nobody else has right now and that
didn't do we want to do anything more basic with the a bit more advanced of the user interface in terms of do what school for buttons or do
having an l. c. d. "'cause" it's an increase cost unless you can think
it just might be frustrating where you can make it goes fast as you want but i

so that flexible it is a on the kinetic provision of energy so that's
v. it might not be completely confusing but
more reliable it's the ones that put a lot would allow us to market our product as being you know last one to damage and more resistors
more resistors those things like spillage of liquids over it or you know
it or you know we streets uses as it happens of remote controls
it's not that it's four buttons that are under cross out to the t.
out to the t. b. it is it taking control all of the important as from that along
instead of play stop rewind fast forward there that's up down louder and quiet or
so i think we can you go for something that size or something looks
because the scroll wheel comes up quite a cost
for it you scroll button and the menu isn't it

rather presentation and then hopefully
does anyone really want to go first
i i'll go first
a simple chip which is the least expensive but i have no
the numbers the volume control and channel control teletext i says the volume and
that's that is the next step is technology
i it's just another way to do the exact same thing the buttons to
that so i think it is it makes it easy to mark it's easy to differentiate
the only thing i'm the interface side of it is that i see the dilemma
you'd need a display and they do anything

i'm gonna talk for that but what we're gonna i'm
i'm gonna take some knocks rather presentation
you don't have my name
because of the book of rather than a that's
i like a wave right
this think we're a new for
make a remote it doesn't look like remote
just another it is just a an idea i don't know
that's gone and this that money that's a trap as

design we have our choices in materials and
i think a weighted i can't
with the interface we have the following options we can we
we can use pushbuttons we can
there are so many people making these products at this price right now what
it's an area
know what i see with a scroll wheel is everybody has buttons so from
so from a marketing standpoint i have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique to create

my name is in the amount i i see it on off button
to make it to make that like i think plastic inner shell or not
shell or not kind of a and to have the rubber out or some make it more durable and also maybe
the rubber
and if you make it from it's super rubber when you drop it on the floor can bounce right back up in your hand you don't even
the advantage is a working with plastic and rubber is what we will have a lot more options as in terms of shape because you can next
of shape because you can next should plastic and initially do you want so

three people in that sense and
so the basic battery versus greatly a
i like the kinetic
is it is more i mean it is more eco friendly than the cradle "'cause" you still
that when we have something like a cradle or something if that's it is a marketing
a cradle and also having of the the actual design of the the case itself having like this like rubber shell made with the plastic into your hand in it look
hand in it look really

so taken that why you know of the of the problem but rubber buttons are the more reliable it's the
it's been so long
because we have a product market and
if you give me if you give me a cut out what everybody else has and i need it any define the lower cost
and what i keep throwing out that i just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this saying look or act or in some way identify itself is unique are different
not necessarily you
necessarily you could make it so that it'll i was just gonna be send a signal to the t. v. the t. v.s that so if you send a bit fight for channels if you do that it's gonna fight ones if you do that

alright we get some science read yes
number a normal
you can use a basic battery which we've already discussed
a tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that i don't know that's
but i have no numbers to give you a regular
we could use another one i made it this report you know the information are we discussing here and so

the cradle "'cause" you still using power off with the cradle so
in materials and traces in the general shapes that we can do a matter of choices are
a matter of choices are a plastic latex tight are plastic or rubber latex type thing wood or titanium if we do
if we do with titanium we're gonna be a limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough
because it's tough to shape the taking it and
but would get would give it a lot of them are conditioner

we can are we can accents we whatever party
i have no idea exactly what they're talking about but that's that
but that's that will be uncurved flat curved or double curved
right that makes sense
and does anybody really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should be that's that off and forth
right now is right now there's nothing coming out of the t. v. to receive so

axis and double curved is curved into it
so the only information you can display in this remote is what channel you just sent to that less than this
the questions that i we need to this thing about
thing about do you guys have to label and it's a good idea till the last thing so
again i think it's the more unique miss you can bring the product be easier it is i believe me to market
again the pushbuttons i c. r. or everywhere and so

so presentation from i design would go best next
i can not the picture that's no
buttons or do we want it for the two scroll field do we want to go l. c. d. do want
i know personally that would be a very attractive features to have a have a button i can push to find the remote control
it is and we're gonna need a speaker then something like that as should be
it'll be really cheap

you've got leds here and the end of the an integrated circuit board
a. batteries this is pretty standard remote
so the what i would propose is something more or less in the direction of what is to use the right to that slide but without
trend watching and
to create something more complex or more expensive than i don't know if that makes it a marketing necessity but

so that's like that flashlight we have to shake it we've got solar
we've got solar cells which
interface concept
yes but has your name on it
and for marketing is the height product and we're gonna be selling it to people are buying t. v.s as presumably

that is that it's better spam
so a new product i need a product
or do you think volume would be
i'm thinking something like can almost like these pens you know where there is you have plastic
have that and i don't think it's all these natural so it would be used

so we've got it in this drawing he are in this example here this is the eighteen and a chip but i dunno us
dunno us to double a. batteries this is
a management said yes that is
so bad i don't know exactly what the increase cost is gonna be but i think you

for electronics we have these very technical descriptions here a simple chip
till the last thing so what we need to know all in terms of marketing and project manager and are there any other questions that we need to answer night before you guys and one bulb s.
i think if you can have the base station with the locator i think those are two very strong features if that's something that
if that's something that can be integrated with other much of the extra cost

are manufacturing division wanted speech recognition they say
speech recognition they say it could put it to work but
to work but we don't think so
it you'll be you know be affected by the the speech in

no we can do multiple scroll wheels but
so the scroll wheel in or out
that my personal preferences it i don't think
i don't think the cost is justified for a little bit more unique spin already have that and i don't think

so are big decision then is like how do we do like we have to decide
it receives no information
so i don't see any reason for having an l. c. d. "'cause"
but we we will need a receiver

not tutsis it's been listening to like a piece too much
that as as soon as
and so on so when we have a cradle when we have some kind of design so

and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now
your name is a name
is it the television can tell you can

and you've got all these buttons which kind of press down little rubber not be ease into these little holes that where do we
broken remote control right
let's get a product that

so here options for a power source as you can use a basic
but in the like it shows that big ears bigger remotes get less lost about
and if you just think about it as to one to the white but the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe sent a one but teletext

but it's interesting "'cause" you shake it like this or like
i can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote it's just
it's just the indy technology really you know

it to be the market is senses not it's not a relative we can are we can
but these are curved and double curved i believe
and it's also be really durable

whatever party put in there we can find a way it looks into it
that's because you're not going to be getting it is often it's gonna need to be more
it's gonna need to be more expensive because of the week real

and it didn't say specifically but i have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel in the multiple scroll wheels
i see so many of "'em" out there's
i personally you were saying about be plastic with the rubber

because we want it to be a wall and design but
and need something the market about this think we're
we could for the television

i'm a little bit stuck right now and that what what is it to them what the market and it with that special
bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like
i will tell you have to go with a like a meeting chips i would imagine

it's i it is different at all say specially
at all say specially
the itself but that's kinda either

i believe kind of
be lose the scroll wheel in or out

so we've got the conceptual design meeting we've all got
rarely and all those

and fixation in this case
and it with that special or increase marketable features i don't believe the product as a consumer demand

so it'll look inside your it really all looking remote control you've got
board you've got a couple diodes here for i dunno who and what that so

and if and we've got our cradle i park real idea
right i think that too big just points that we have so far are the having a cradle and

that are either screen i think it's
that's it is a marketing standard i need something to market to make this product unique

a normal thing because you could sell as a novelty this should
a novelty this should be actually see this for many here you can

these my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell to make it
so all our big questions here really are we don't on a cradle do we go basic

in your hand you don't even need to read only did it
we can target like environmentally friendly ideas that so i think it is it

i would this like this panel would be kinda like a double curved where it's curved
where it's curved multiple axes right i think curved

or six i've no idea
i think it might mean something like that so shape because of the book

yes the difference is with a simple chip operate or
or was in the scroll up

previous a simple
a simple chip is required to operate pushbuttons

even still there's gonna be interfere but there's still will be interface from the t. v. it might not
do want to do is they wanted anything else on it

it's still i don't think it's practical i think is a bad idea
i think is a bad idea for a

that's not a scroll wheel
and that means we can make some adjustments and the reach a little surprised if we need to it

is technology and then there's technology which we're moving into the next phase
and so we're gonna have to new technology to enhance the marketability

at again i'm not sold on the product because we don't have
because we don't have a product in my opinion

quite understand that scroll-wheels of the quite expensive to make
but i think you guys have a point it

is that they sense that she for a grip something like that
no made maybe

no made maybe a bit more than design here but do it
and from my perspective i think l. c. d. is a mistake because

so all the questions that i
what overall things that we not the same dunno

what you guys like in the user interface
it's that one button to but it is you did you did i really

makes you live in a more fresh is your office
with them over time here

over time here we've got another ten minutes i think that's
i think we have like it's not very usable and it will bring

'cause it's it breaks down easier
for me i think the scroll-wheel actually may not be so bad i don't know

and so you see you're talking about now
it's just it's it's just of look-and-feel think it has

so do we need to retrain mic on how to put is mike on

probably not tutsis

just when you do something exciting

get ready to go so

we've all got exciting ideas now and fixation

case so the user agenda our agenda

but what you guys talk before we make decisions

component i think

my name is

jose him and it's

see it on off button a sheep

so i had to this and with a rash

a sheep

you've got a pretty it's a pretty that circuit board here and you've got

but with a broken remote control so you've also got

so you've also got you get a chip here he batteries here and some sort electronics

it is you can kind it is

i would change that

i'd i got a flashlight and but it's interesting

i dunno we had some good i think guys down there the department so

so that flexible

cells which i don't think is very good idea because we could not use your remote at night three people

so we have a battery that's true

case design we have

and also maybe it i think it feels a little better than plastic

he you get be clear on the rubber

i think curved means just curved in one axis and

we can use a scroll-wheel with an integrated push button and l. c. d.

and l. c. d. display

display or multiple scrolling wheels

so these are all options that the user interface guy from o. has is just as to put together user interface

a regular chip which is like the medium porridge the medium space

an advanced chip is required to operate the l. c. d. display and it didn't say

let's in a my presentation

technical functions are interface concept

but other than above board for it's as

some of the things to bake but

i mean if somebody says up in the middle it television show it's gonna change the channel

so if you press and then

that kind of wouldn't wanna do that

that would kind of lose it

controls as for the point are we making about losing it will

but without with a light less complicated design so

the volume and channel control can just become those are the four button or a as in if it was a round dial

trend watching as a later date there

there's nothing about the product it makes me wanna choose at product over other products are out there

that's just it that's just something he had a graphic to use to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like

"'cause" "'cause" right now i don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we have a product

price right now what are we gonna do to make this one special and unique

what is special and unique about a scroll

give me some new technology don't give me the same

i'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go to create a little better then we have that as but there

so what i'm saying is from my perspective i don't have a product to market right now

my personal preferences that we make some adjustment in the cost i do or develop an

or develop an integrated new take not technology that's that

i need a product to market and i just

and i just whatever pride you get put together will find a way to market that i'm not concerned but

my question is what would the scroll-wheel do

about that was in your presentation so

but again from marketing perspective i want as much new and different about this thing is possible because

this thing is possible because for welcome what is a very competitive market

that they're gonna be more expensive but

it to do it but i mean i would just use if i was gonna do this i would just use the scroll-wheel for its channels up and channels down

i don't think value or do you think

that first of all the menu and

i'd i like the idea of forcing the my personal

and if we keep the rest and the format that is durable because the

so if we can market it in terms of that and the other

if we need to it also can create it on demand from its uniqueness

we have to decide on it doesn't have

on it doesn't have to say the on button not exactly the details but do we have

what state of casing i personally

where there is you have plastic bits and then

but just kinda like if you used the plastic with rubber on the outside

here but do it just is it kind of an inspiration these pens i think a kind of

because this is a universal remote and all

remote and all you're doing i mean it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television so the only information

less than this is not a lot of information you know they're it receives

unless you can think of something interesting to do with it

to receive so who knows technology changes and information starts coming out of the cable box or something those i don't see that

we have to i think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the in a user interface is gonna be lose the scroll

thing we're gonna be can competing in a broader market then if we go with something unique

i don't know about like the flip phone idea because

i mean what i say one of the things one other things you brought up in or your presentation is you get children there's task it's inside the circuit really get dirty they get messy with drinks and this

and i the question that do you mean actually knows whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go and sell at a as a very different product or

or do we really need the scroll wheel as because the scroll wheel

i think they get in the cost effectiveness i think if you can

the locator is gonna require a radio transmitter which

integrated so

cheap it's not gonna need quality is it is

or maybe you could like have a smell or am i you know you push a button

i you know you push a button minutes put sense think you can

guys have a point it might push somebody or the edge one they're looking at our remote versus else when they see this one has a scroll-wheel to go up and down the channels

t. v. because some t. v.s are quite for changing channels from obliques all if you've got a scroll

all if you've got a scroll been used you have to scroll what really small we just saw that you're actually keeping in case with the t. v.s ability to change channels are you have

that was my intuition of a scroll wheel would be

if you just centred one

that's gonna kill actually i

fast as you want but i think what people get used to it i

to it i do like the idea the scroll wheel

i know what because it's on a television the television tells

i see so if maybe if we had an l. c. d. of the top they just did a number on it right

what about this what about if you can program in your favourite channels into the scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels in a

in a big

kinda either you program it though
