along with the colours are clear evidence have a set of people said they'd spend more money on it
can apply i can take notes mean as the they don't the only use the word for the television or
do it like that and then i fall i've got six remote controls for us their system additional box d. v. d. player video player t. v. for was
i mean my beer is to use multiple things the same time and more
but all the logo on c. and but it's all the functions like audio settings are hardly are you saying is very
d. displays but the data wasn't there so
is just a drawer it's a
possibly this p. recognition as possible someday that into the design of a lot of
of the thing i'll read it should have functionality
it should have functionality it like people's brains a functionality the relevance to the remote and how often do you used so
given that some be
if we wanted something different truly difference in the bottom those remote control we'll be
i can say technical problem so that's in terms of the you know the sent to the television "'cause" it's the actual
'cause it's the actual television says that heidi very handy watching b. c. and then at night change itself so it probably needs
a part is central to
i'm it was in the plenty of people could you could still eat lose this remote
r. that's us but as known
to make use a desirable that people use it they mean you can buy another one and one
given that we bought it i have an extensive discussion
there's a user centred one and an engineering centred one put her pictures
put her pictures of and
we have to decide what's gonna make our product different
since neither of them are fundamental decisions to make before we
the number things you buy these days but never had a lithium or so the battery in that's

so but we zips
eliminated so the between
and i start
which is a plus for us we could
and more public what's really like twelve maybe if you
these regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels volumes
having a big issue is that is use only
'cause we forgot remote that like or
that like or off some of the signal of the like a teletext but
but it's not frequently used is
which are a wall relevance and really
to be seen the new more mobile phones have
a power then they have the like texting and then the numbers on one side so you could
"'cause" you know audio settings naught point eight percent and if they want that
rosa to attend
if you want to make this so simple the any be to walk into the room and lift it up and sign
and identify what the necessary things are what people are not you really wanna have a remote control do and then there are
and this is the engineering centred which
something like this shot you know
that possible but buttons like that but with the entire
this just types as the energy source which is in

simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of to have interchangeable
to have interchangeable for a shows that people can
but possibly keep the back to the mountains but the reality that people even though they then on the agenda teletext anymore but it's only the look of the things
the logo thing on the bottom the screen that the two lost in grey against the yellow background
this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of ideas about making it attractive to that to the markets that so
that so do you do need to do some constraints as to how we might do that
but they will say we want it to be simple to get to market quickly we should
again the idea that there is no you're
and frustrations
frustrations of like people this remote control them
got small things you can fit and this presentation
what we can have was more proportion of people using remotes were in this particular age groups and
volume yes
and that would be and in the been told to ignore teletext
white that's again except that the risk of losing it
it the right so the case or

that switching as easily
and that they don't necessarily agree with what we we sold and
what is not quite clear from the direct is whether they mean the
and on that basis but i think we need to do that in mind
it also has to be simple that's amazing
i would have to be checking run it so we're looking
we can we don't know you do it but it's a proportion the religion as an age groups
with my personal preferences i think this one is easier to use it has
what the all the different technology i mean
and i think we've also had mentioned adding a locating device on and so what it does get stuck
just everyone is guaranteed to last five ten years and

that is use only use ten percent the buttons "'cause"
that big a structure we're looking at so
the cable box and have it just go on the t. v. and
b. c. wall
r. t. k. the limited functions that we don't
functions that we don't we use much little glory to
little glory to get teletext but
is just about the technical function is so
which maybe i would have that features switch which would send signals
and that's pretty much it

because we're looking straight is a team here and
dick and people can really aspects of all this is like you know what they want to see
so some can use i'll should be incorporated it was lovely
is used the most so
we can maybe even start to cut down on or
or suppose you thinking of a design that maybe some other buttons or even for maybe they use like our folding
to keep the volume selection and channel selection very easily
and so what it does get stuck are the couch cushions as a then we did you can find them is that and that's

and it probably this is one that people complain about having too many buttons that you don't use
with the top and i was thinking maybe if it were white or at the top and that would be easier
when we're talking about haven't losing it may
in fact but when you get that far
and the circuit chip is a part actually composes different messages are within the remote and which will then
many user interface which
interface which controls the chip and that's the messages and
a circuit chip but in that to control and send the messages and last centre and receiver

the people might want to use as in addition to the existing remote controls
screen the want to watch a lot of
that big a structure
you're saying about it could take a bronze of like us on television saying the channel number and she's we can do have like
she's we can do have like an activation
and again they needed to the technicalities of
i mean that all these remotes a presumably infrared not have been

the also last if we would people pay more for speech rec is and the younger people
is and the younger people say they would
may be incrementally anything but
on one side so you could have the most used buttons on top and
and the this for pay more for speech recognition
so we're looking at we can we don't
what people miss them

almost like that so the a common walked around for a t. f. and so i was using the day but
incorporates the italian and then the colours and
of and then we can have to decide which one that should be in
and i've seen a musically
before we making a
perhaps we should have the disposable remote control or

i mean you could and as you print only
and so for this product it's gonna be television only and then it has to have
for the company and the colours and so
we want something that sends message is easily to the television and i was kind of wondering
they probably clip two euro
making a point that the big energy sources a very valid want

welcome to this second meeting this design group
all three k. through the nets so the last meeting
but that it gets lost
that's amazing goes along the first one and the way
it's that's what is eighteen calls than others are that's the marketing

and it just done in the fall and the hand that could be
that the keys might be concave simply because
you won't lose it
so i'll just a presentation on the working design
know the battery will last

that's a lot of the only digits use it who thinks about to get a first
as we went over
often but they are quite important when they used
and the other night buttons all
would send signals to the subcomponent and onto the whiteboard think it's a little light

if you click on the or the one that looks like a projection screen the want to
and but having a big issue is
more products and then just kind of trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and
actually cheap in that in terms of whether they do the power requirements of the so she's also compromise they are a need for a rare it being permanently available what the all the
also definitely a user friendly interface

and put the house or something
if you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing that's maybe quite a change my
or even make it even just have a left on digits
and tried to use it
receiver so that you get the buttons and anywhere in the room and the channel still be changed

losing it may be to have a button on the television that you present it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that so it's easier to find
that but with the entire top with the you know the infrared was have a source
so that's it's final feel direction so that's
sort of user interface which i think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that
it's just a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for this just types

and the hand that could be said anything to individuals because
the day but that had so speech recognition which works
which works are remarkably also
i mean that was certainly be a treaty different

but we may need to talk that's true
and the buttons are concealed country
if people really didn't use those buttons to an extent at all the middle altogether we could actually
docking place and so constantly be charged you

which tells me designer so you're of them
on want to just carry on with all
centred which has a lot more buttons and it
it has been quite a bit off your buttons

maybe like it'll beep or something
and that time take
so we could power on and channel selection and volume selection we have to really
and senate resourceful feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit

i mean whereas translation which is very high relevance is used
i would appear to be essential
if we can design something that looks interesting
no looks different

combined with decrease the r. t. k. the
all these are the two different ones this one
just general findings what we need
what we need it at technically speaking of remote control is some sort of energy source at some sort of user interface which

and that would be easier
and so we have to decide what's
different being unique
being unique style maybe have a light up so it's

but you shouldn't need to point the thing it's anything in particular
have it be kind of like the satellite boxer the cable box and have
that but they said you would spend more on a remote that looks better

and that it should just always work one of the u. or then use it and that
on those and will be challenging in terms of all we discussed at the first meeting
said

climbing item we have forty minutes to do this in line
but if you just if you open say channel one or p. d. c.
and if anybody many just about it then we'll give them a new one

or whether they don't want to pick up a big ears d. v. d.s source light boxes which i mean
which i mean we saw was paying fundamental to the to the exercise the
want to sort it all usage know the battery will

the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours
be simple "'cause" that's what people want anyway
we possibly need to be looking at something different initial range of the older radio remote controls where you change next tools

we should there is a choice but
i don't like slides back and the buttons are concealed
should we actually part of the policy if people

colonel calls not match the operating behaviour of the user i can apply i can take
there so that actually you know what the results for that where someone
i mean what we had usage by a structure what we can have was

is we can system of you press a button on the t. v. or
as i think a bit like something a system where you can if you something else to find remote control
they're not used often but they are

what we need to sit
our singing and just things are then we could make things
we could make things much more for like that but they said

or just kind of appeal to
the changeable face plates and the
and the lighting up and visible i was when we're talking about haven't

came to try to
try to give it a seven
and the user interface is that's just in that to the design of the actual route what you're holding hands and what buttons are we on it

where you change next tools to have a menu change channels
what's that i think they say if we going to it if minimum number
it if minimum number buttons is a partially then we should because i mean i really but the boats and then we'd use the buttons the absolute minimum know

think it's a little light up once we start want to start pressing buttons
buttons also send signals t. v. infrared bulb which
bulb which will be the part actually what send signals to the the television and then

and and he's working equally so
and repetitive strain injury specific remote

but we zips all that they the problems of existing remote controls were very a boring shape and boring colour
and then we suisse all the but we needed to do was to make the device control several items that switching as easily

it and that they should be too small but that it
network also

before like do that how whether i will get it through some new project requirements so
so the management placed on those and

do as it is also that we will then talk to the functions that we see the device and actually climbing item we have
perhaps you should either reduce the that's what the meeting parts even more but not even need a few components and

and they want to i need to cover televisions
we could actually have a touch of a remote control with

no it's inside and etcetera
maybe the advantage of doing where the buttons all together is it makes them cheaper

and i start
and then just i don't know if fault and then

for us we could make it look better or cost-effective we can put price
of the mountains the channel and volume and that would be and

again so if i'm say it's a separate set you say they zap a lot way to
they want i out up have some sort of rechargeable battery or

it may be fewer buttons which tells me designer
seven

you know to make it too complicated easy to use for a new like for some user
and really used to keep the

control make may possibly even use have to make it a few buttons like as you know
are and then give it a command

like as you know the whole mice a idea of a feel more comfortable maybe to
centred it has a quite a few fewer buttons and

and there was a section on our on the report for l. c. d. displays but
are the basic function of remote control is to send messages to another system the t. v. l. e. d. v. d. player or whatever it does

like our folding whether something so that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings which are a wall relevance
be a what i was gonna say maybe like the flip phones that they used to be seen the new more

just removable cover
battery or at that are docking place and so

so it probably needs to the posture as you need a button on it
it's all something just to identify the b. fifty the japanese years and

need and is a functional frequency and the buttons and so
and so that was a ignoring it ignoring power of the mountains

gonna have a really good option
which time i mean in a second on that digital television will be taken in the in that time scale

we could even have a sleek the buttons control that's the voice functions
this one this is the user centred it has a

i brought it would look better as
eric it certainly buttons a possibility for making it these really very distinctive

so what a remote
hm

what a remote control is it is you need to send messages to the television set you know turn on
and i was kind of wondering about this example that they have it

that so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that
so that's my presentation

not have been a long time
my personal preferences i think we it's

which ones are spoken to
which is in t. v. circuit chip which

and then you've got your happy little t. v. watcher there
so my personal preferences

constantly be charged you wouldn't have to you boring about running out of batteries are not changing channels for real a wide range
a wide range to us and the receiver so that you get

the any to be console to make it interesting that the

a shows that people can personalise it eliminated

so the between sitting down rooms

also we have so if the three presentations before

the not the management hasn't it sends all some this and

narrow than the new requirements

than the new requirements are the management team see that's teletext is no longer of any importance given the the most internet and

whether they mean the they wanted to cover teletext or whether

the the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television and

and the way for decide this it must be simple "'cause" that's what

that's the meeting a bit summarise don't know

said first of all have individual calls from everybody

there is no you're older persons here

i can i steal cable

no or is it functional requirements

or is it functional requirements from the r. k. i. statement a research lab dick and people can really

and it's irrelevant by the user so it may be fewer buttons

that time take into a new remote controls is

specific remote control make

more comfortable maybe to even have to hold such

or must be some telly at the extent there is to get r. s. i. from the television remote is on one side

but the also last

for that where someone may be incrementally

a full one of the cuts that i was gonna say you can't get lower side is just a drawer it's

like the power using the using that to switch the power switch on t. v. is how rubber's of nine but it's not frequently

i wonder whether we could get a remote control no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition given that some

net do we know whether they

forty you know if the full forty five to fifty five age group and also fundamental but i use a remote controls to a great extent has to be

the only problem i can think of what that is if you've got people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new remote controls if you just kind of take

digits but then once on top your t. v. never

on the t. v. and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are you won't lose it

but look at the importance of them the volume settings

what we need to sit at it for things that people actually need and is a functional

the channel and volume that in you want so

and we can still have a interchangeable for a she's even if it's in the so the yellow and grey

buttons all buttons as an option

i just a part is central to

i have seen that as soon as you said computer for as you see the

for as you see the address the remote addressing these

keep it depends whether

addressing these are and then

device itself

is this i've that's always gonna be a problem i think

have a really good option in the middle of your report

get teletext but as a channel setting make it make them to people sort do some people want the whole function of the way but

but to see if we're marketing and what kind of fashionable approach them a bit would be fashionable fashion over practicality

as we could we can make its dual function for the voice recognition and mean so that it but still have buttons on it and user

that's the voice functions controlled of things that you would do all the time so

"'cause" it does not have to believe that all bomb box

i think it was a number of buttons

i can do mine

it's i can make this work

and we have to click function and i have some fun

so this is just about the technical

the method i looked on line for example some other some more products and

and then there are two different kinds that i found there's a user centred

you know turn on off switch channels and volume and things that of that and so

and then it has to have be a logo was

it looks kind of narrow with the top and i was thinking

have a light up so it's usable in the dark the changeable

can i i'm watching you use the nichols great

nichols great technical problems are here and i've seen a musically

let's move all they're all they're

they're all they're not connected in the table it should be more

it's rather than then that the traditional in fact

but you use of how would you hands

such as i mean so you hold it like that possible but

possibly but i've got channel and volume buttons and on off and nothing else

so the recover it could have on the same top white that's

case or what do you all for some this

b. s. could use it on your screen

that's kind of

that's kind of

just that the near the household method of how the remote control works are the basic function of

it does this by you need to start been energy source and

and which will then be sent to the the television the d. v. d. to tell what do you many user

shoot and

i think we it's a big energy source they want i out up

i "'cause" we've got any statistics on the dark expectancy of remote controls perfectly so the independent ones

in that's net a replacing

and five ten years

at the end of
