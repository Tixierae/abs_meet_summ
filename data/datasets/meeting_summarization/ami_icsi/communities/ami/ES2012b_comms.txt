frustrations of like people this remote control them
that time take into a new remote controls is
the only problem i can think of what that is if you've got people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new remote controls if you just kind of take
and identify what the necessary things are what people are not you really wanna have a remote control do and then there are

that is use only use ten percent the buttons "'cause"
control make may possibly even use have to make it a few buttons like as you know
or suppose you thinking of a design that maybe some other buttons or even for maybe they use like our folding
on one side so you could have the most used buttons on top and
and the other night buttons all
buttons all buttons as an option
i think it was a number of buttons
it if minimum number buttons is a partially then we should because i mean i really but the boats and then we'd use the buttons the absolute minimum know
possibly in a buttons at all but if we can incorporate

what we need to sit
what we need to sit at it for things that people actually need and is a functional

so it probably needs to the posture as you need a button on it
need and is a functional frequency and the buttons and so
we could even have a sleek the buttons control that's the voice functions
that's the voice functions controlled of things that you would do all the time so
receiver so that you get the buttons and anywhere in the room and the channel still be changed
but if we can incorporate channel changing volume buttons and into the design then that's fine
but we clearly any need the main buttons although it t. v. and you need the main functions
and the any buttons are think we need are channel control volume control and on off

'cause we forgot remote that like or
for as you see the address the remote addressing these
i mean that all these remotes a presumably infrared not have been

if people really didn't use those buttons to an extent at all the middle altogether we could actually
and it probably this is one that people complain about having too many buttons that you don't use

no looks different
we're looking at a radically different shape

do it like that and then i fall i've got six remote controls for us their system additional box d. v. d. player video player t. v. for was
as i think a bit like something a system where you can if you something else to find remote control
we could actually have a touch of a remote control with
i wonder whether we could get a remote control no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition given that some
forty you know if the full forty five to fifty five age group and also fundamental but i use a remote controls to a great extent has to be
just that the near the household method of how the remote control works are the basic function of
i "'cause" we've got any statistics on the dark expectancy of remote controls perfectly so the independent ones
perhaps we should have the disposable remote control or
that they i mean they the actual to find the remote control was that you operating

and it's irrelevant by the user so it may be fewer buttons
it may be fewer buttons which tells me designer
centred it has a quite a few fewer buttons and
centred which has a lot more buttons and it

but we zips all that they the problems of existing remote controls were very a boring shape and boring colour
the people might want to use as in addition to the existing remote controls

and repetitive strain injury specific remote
specific remote control make

if we wanted something different truly difference in the bottom those remote control we'll be
we possibly need to be looking at something different initial range of the older radio remote controls where you change next tools

dick and people can really aspects of all this is like you know what they want to see
should we actually part of the policy if people
what we can have was more proportion of people using remotes were in this particular age groups and
what people miss them
i'm it was in the plenty of people could you could still eat lose this remote
to make use a desirable that people use it they mean you can buy another one and one
get teletext but as a channel setting make it make them to people sort do some people want the whole function of the way but
people prop i

these regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels volumes
but look at the importance of them the volume settings
of the mountains the channel and volume and that would be and
the channel and volume that in you want so
you know turn on off switch channels and volume and things that of that and so
possibly but i've got channel and volume buttons and on off and nothing else

the also last if we would people pay more for speech rec is and the younger people
is and the younger people say they would
