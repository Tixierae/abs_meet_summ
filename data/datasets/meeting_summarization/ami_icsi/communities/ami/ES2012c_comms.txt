i think we made some different progress the last one then
richer that's it so there for life guaranteed for life
advice and given that this has to get to mark it as quickly as possible
for example if you can preprogrammed then like numbers one through ten and preprogrammed
so that but if i can interrupt
if i can interrupt about the
about the cage on
for example if i'm using a mouse i like to have the slide up and down so that might be good for
like shape of a almost like a mess with
wish she had twice as important the second aspect which is
face things that we could have a fruit vegetable theme this year and whatever happens
also meeting topic that damaging
i did i mean is this are at the same interesting idea is a real swatch
watches where right only batteries ever got change and there's just
i know what you're saying and understand where you're coming from
or go like like more than just the battery like a complete different like you know it like
you know it like a good the space to but you
the space to but you keep this is expensive
and this is the microphone and this is the power
and this is the power source and then
then if you have people use a couple a one in the them are they wouldn't want to go and spend have many or lose on a new one not gonna do a complete near the window
that's just it would be covers use or tricky them into it continuing to spend their money on our product about making them feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product so
the gonna make this part of like a part of like it is the fashions
speak so

think if we since the meeting of the design group
our again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting
so again how will have a three presentations from the three of you and then
then this is where i need to kate's expertise advice and
sir know
to give ourself we're it definitely gonna go with the voice option would probably have to design our own chip and
i don't actually have any price information know
information know
i haven't heard anything at it and say about that
given that i made a frames incorporate voice activated i don't think so
so the minute that for slightly
that this information is from is this is a internal
and you know what we get then the fruit and veg recent that's just
to hold and then if you had
maybe a mass like a hairbrush like you get the that the way of that and the pen and widens
and the pen and widens laptop and you can fit all on
adjust volume the power could be wherever up the top or something for you guys think about

so that when people are happy with that they will be able to buy and everything else from as
which is sent a t. v. answer seen
however to not have buttons are to use a voice commands is the buttons might make these connections more difficult and i raise
speaks and his name it'll tell the number for you so
the double risk
perhaps we ought to stick to two buttons since the last thing
that sounds good
clutter avoid too many buttons and also
cage on setting a bad some slides controls on it
this one on one side or
keep this is expensive but this is like the chip
and again people the option of buying a new like a plea new thing the range
this is fashionable with
the although
are up here and then it would have a lot of wider thing to have to light the infrared light at the t. v. and just gonna change channels and adjust volume
bring it to mess and just speak so

that'd be the internal shape then
and us experts on these things but presumably there must
it inevitably had a custom design should is gonna be more expensive to into in a where
second aspect which is it technologically it innovative and say to so
phones that are just some troops an animal pen colours
what it so that it came and that
a lot of light sauces
on a button yellow seem to build a strong colour to make it a little
colour to make it a little think you know we're in jamaica
i know that i play
think you know we're in jamaica white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour
i mean we're it's simply required to incorporate it may be the corporate like a prominently
make that a fashion symbols
sort of a combination
i'm just i'm will is not here were discussed how much how good is gonna be to change channels to

and i don't i think a discussion was around the fact that if we go in a jail for a long lasting power supply then it's sealed for life and that if
that so that's your area of expertise and then
so i can you read just about one back up again planes
so as far as i say is you can't "'cause" mobile phones
pick a little picture of what i thought it could look like so just kind of
so just kind of minimise bit clutter avoid too many buttons
so thirteen easy to
i was event is running it from the in is the whole thing is all in a completely it's all the together and
i'd start if we
if we needed and that we're gonna talk about a pick a sliding all that and just build in a hole thingy more than having
have the power or wherever somewhere
but there is still channels so you know the brightness as wrong new t. v. or the contrast
given these states the technology you we want something that mean that we know you will work

and then the no they for design of the case is can this field and
just talking to
just talking to be components design
and produces a signal in a morse code format the signal sent a
the signal sent a transistor which
as for how we should end up use it as a remote of a warming questions are the buttons are you
that's got but is it the actual shape that people
and that there's no i've met possibility of confusing the two so
just pass those along
but fashions that don't last very long
so that you know when they hold it's because the
it's because the mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand maybe
and fiddle around and also

then the people at a premium just me best they've got lots
and the shapes that will be easily recognisable i. e. and as a trendy remote control and be as a real reaction product so
course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive you know hundred
i think they're about the same cost really i think it's just
the there's a lot of slide button that i think it's pretty much
of a depending on fire shape of a "'cause"
say a minute are you are
and you know the design the art else than that and it could be a make these and no this is not just a television remote control is there a
that in the we need

then the this is all be intimidated be the user interface with
and then if the next meeting it will be looking at the look feel and design can't really
i never thought i know sir
that you know something it kind of like a scroll kind of you know it's a kind of like sticks in a minute
up like when you get a semi
you get a semi circle use
circle use top one then like
that this is never been seen as a fashion item before
that's the fits in making

can use so i was thinking perhaps combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow to the combination
we have to do the chips of the cost and aligned purses off the shelf and
given the company wants is on the market quickly and cheaply that
that would pay to it actually constraints to an existing chip and the stifle conventional button technology
no not before we care anything else does anybody
it does have a question about that doesn't
the only advantage i was thinking of ten having the buttons like the buttons on one side for the channel and then the sliders that if you're is holding in your hand and you pick it up it's easy ten times now this is just the volume and this is the channel
on with this not that used and you know the
that's just to make it like a banana but

it's fun but i mean
i it's something we discussed since the sort of beginning so
and we've been talking about of the whole time and i'm in fact
and i'm in fact kind of inclined to say that we should just go for it
from my my presentation so technologically
is a real swatch watches where
source and then the m. one c.s and
than having kidding cheap the production costs
you plug right

and a key control the buttons for your fingers
and they use for problem is that some executive summary for us on the top three things want to buy consumer we've got reports from past
we've got reports from past one on you fashions
look you have to look fancy look-and-feel
and this is just wish
plus i was gonna say
for vegetables important to this year and a pointer furniture should can say
of like it to sort of fashion it we go over
like a cat times are changing face things that we could

'cause mobile phones expensive you can
six fresh my findings a second war sport aspect features that the device should be technologically innovative
technologically innovative
same question do we
controls on it i think the reasonable use pushbuttons is that the base it simple shape and reliable
so three because there's three buttons on the slide three but the channel up
or but the i mean that this is what state that's got but is it
for the volume but what do you guys think we can

then comes interesting it's suggestions for a tiny remote control our
that people use and
we get we guarantee for the life of the of the product and the shapes that
depending on the cost of the product itself you know could we have a cheaper bookkeeper power source and then just have that i knew we need instead of having a ten year guarantee within changeable
new one because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product
and they tend to rely the let's say a minute
just resting you want something that we grew up so maybe be

and if you have any buttons there should be very few of them in any for they use functions that are cheating tried to the people use
also we have to work within the company constraints and
i mean i think that's what we're suggesting all to address all three of those
so kind of maybe a little wider and that's that's pretty comfortable
that's pretty comfortable to hold and then if
it like we're leaving out the buttons for that the first recall you we
you we could incorporate that into the voice

it would it's hard to predict time
run it's a thing we need to make any
but the i was like this is pricing given that i made
are not so as far as i say
and given that it's never been done before
it will have the voice recognition if
if that means miss i miss make a four buttons but i mean the mobile same question

they've got lots of buttons on the
of buttons on the other people don't use and find
and we thought that's it for a new remote control that we want to rush and by
that we should look at speech recognition of the rubber of the buttons and if you have any buttons
right you could as a as like a minus you could
don't know what the weather that you had the fix part of it is the corporate but

and then you can preprogrammed the channels voice recognition and then they push response sample locator
they're from the fashion watch my past have said from vegetables are important theme for clothes furniture and she said she has a cloths
has a cloths shoes and furniture
it is the fashions apply different or should
apply different or should make this part the french
this is fashionable

but presumably there must be lines of them or the on the market that we can modify that so
and can do will be producing a model forced to to look yes so
it also with battery connections the company has some other than the batteries so we can use so i was
was haven't really been used much on remote so there's many chips
very good point

constraints and the company's an for me in the email that they're extra to push buttons or that seems
and that would be made it a one
less buttons and it's
and they're from the fashion watch
but do you know the shape of a kind of those lend itself to voices "'cause" if you're holding

expensive you can say is the voice recognition data is the wood and then
the wood and then
it i mean if you're given that the the technology's not developed and given that it's
top one then like you can keep going up but it's like
be still can just tell it to gonna

but and that's what d. organic you to look in at a t. v.
we should make the whole thing i don't know
the whole thing i don't know but you have like the yellow circle would are in it somewhere on a button yellow
and then people people demand more real reaction
it's sort of it kind of picturing like maybe a shape that some of like a mouse so that

transistor which amplifies it and
as opposed to be twenty euros twenty five euros
we can do that with without any there's any a price information that's a difficult to
and that's a survey want to get the mold said you can just what that different colours different pictures very quickly exactly

v. answer seen by the t. v. and watch
and watch change the channels
and somehow to the combination had to would maybe look up with something that will last a lifetime of the five ten years and we could
plus i

so there's many chips out there that would be easy to to give ourself we're
and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then
one and then you've programme didn't say b. c. for is your channel one is your favourites like to have a certain
but it doesn't matter

like to have a certain number of favourites and that
guys are right but actually the big
the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working
and whatever happens next year we can have the face plates

that as because it easy you know that you know something it
the actual shape that people in it easily pick it up and now you know you were know what is going to do
they like the kind you get i can't it's you know that kinda spongy
kind of

and spongy material used on the inside
unfold so that's different
but this is like the chip and this is the microphone
and you as a external fashions change then we get new you covers on the market is and inevitably available and

in at a t. v. didn't really get away from the the square look at most the current remotes don't know what the
'cause a set in a t. v. the corporate logo needs to be prominent in your display so
if this is the whole point yes you know a part
or a real reaction the remote control film are real reaction coffee maker or whatever and

shape or to you by one of the shelf and programme it a cells
i mean i'm not brown
gonna be we start to get away from the voice functional

yes i do think that promotes in like meant to change the channel on turn the volume or vice versa would be carried
within changeable covers which buy a new one every year and you are many functions can
and you do need to go ups also the middle i did was i was event

"'cause" if you imagine
'cause if you imagine a position the fingers would be better for pressing and that for role and just
we can still incorporate the voice of a less buttons i mean

or "'cause" a set in a t.
we need the manual controls and that
controls and that they should be that fall but

we want to get a four at that a longlasting battery that we get we guarantee
and it will be a in a prominently displayed is possibly the the transmit richer that's it so

you and then we'll make a final the final decision and
sort of a combination

we had some discussions last time as to how we might careful with them we'll
with them we'll found was that was that today

can't really i had the users use it and
use it and trickle say the product evaluation and

please and perhaps bigger to start
signals which are then seen by the t. v.

a pastor and the battery works in conjunction with a sister and i can pass or
what happens is you press a number or give a voice command and this creates

the chip than sense as connection and produces
i see such a marketing people to make turned into a fashion item

the shelf and the custom design will give us much more flexibility enable
flexibility enable us to incorporate voice function that we all seem to have upon how that's

it cheaper it's gonna be a mass produce a quite daring get out there faster but it's going to be less
this is a internal company information is it

and that pretty much sums it up
you know hundred and fifty pounds or something

sort of still in this experimental form
form so it would it's

a thing we need to make any a decision here given the company
ten and preprogrammed say you know nine channels and then just use

doesn't make a difference if they're just a few commands for example if you
thirteen easy to use it's probably a given we have strain

trick once you've got the whole ways chip in there then it's pretty much the world is that those guys are right but actually
it we go over there it looks fancy and fashion supposedly we have to go into but

do you like a person rooms think it will cost
i mean do you do we think the voice technologies fundamental to the project

do we need a five buttons the channel changer then volume up down and on off just as a back-up or just so that people can have to sit there pressing buttons
then to remove rapidly onto can go and

and also one of the things that people have used it as a slide button like you have on a mouse the possibly we
the possibly we could use that on the side for volume for example have the slide button on the side and then you can

button that i think it's pretty much the same sort of connection
kind of fun

but it's like a cold or something so you can take
so you can take up one time

all forms or just for the
i was thinking kind of just for the volume but

so that for you but said make it fun
that's my problem trend watching and

and so the current functional look and feel and this is just
was gonna say for vegetables

i know but i mean my feeling is the current power sources the socks that at all but it's it will cost you can make it last you have any long talking and that
and that can also make it cheap enough that people are the change the cover every we can buy a new one every other than that's even better

what if we include it the batteries in the cover
that a call to come encourages them to buy a new covers and

i mean if this is a serious up to
just another five euro to get

like they have for mobile phones that are just
maybe kind of a

it's a sort of thing that we want people to have problems is displayed on there coffee table to this is something about me
this is fashionable on

i'm a given that we've got a warm on off button presumably two buttons of a channel changing one slide and i see nothing else
that we need to decide on they just the basic shape of the thing and

on to it but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and
if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and i would do voice commands and

i mean i was just an idea but i had
the same idea so you put it in a bit faster than they spend sort of that sorta shape so the

you'd white narrow than a mouse of the time as you can
of the time as you can just resting you want

'cause if you're holding and you fiddling which
and you fiddling which you can also bring it up like that it's microphone

i've done on this about my
my personal view is that if it's not that people in these anyway

the problem with existing remote controls we felt as so they're ugly

don't use and find difficult to learn

and the decisions that we need to make today funny are what energy source we want to use whether it is practical

whether it is practical to use and a longlasting one and

and that if you just one is to run one then we'll give them another one and it will

to do we get a custom designed shape

user interface with that we get the voice buttons all database

if we could have to be three presentations again please and

they say i just i looked at what exactly the remote still they

they way if you press a key or give a voice command and then

and then this is translated into a light signals which are

the materials we're gonna need to look at the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and

and been integrated circuit chip works in conjunction with a diode transistor resonator two more resistors and it a pastor and

and this creates a connection with and the remote that has

that has the chip than

amplifies it and then sends it on t. v. light emitting diode and

which is then the train changed into infrared light which is sent a t.

are you are fewer buttons you have a guest a few internal connections and channel codes are gonna need

and i raise production cost

production cost something we should think about also we have

buttons or that seems to be the most cost effective way of producing it

and we could still keep that original idea

how that's gonna cost more but

gonna cost more but the off the shelf is gonna be it cheaper it's gonna

but it's going to be less flexible with the features that she things like a voice activation was haven't really been used

sir know so i can you read

and do we know how long it looks like to develop a custom chip

a lot longer than off the shelf chip we get we did

that the problem is the voice technology is not really highly developed it sort of still in this

just to incorporate the voice activation this is sort of the trick once you've got the whole

that for slightly different no

design

since the last thing we want to do is present the product that doesn't work

the sort of beginning so i think in our minds it's fundamental were don't

it's fundamental were don't know that the the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that so i think

i think if we're gonna have the voice recognition part of it and then we should have a full whole thing

fine it will

just because then for example if

so that might be good for volume to just be able to kind of role at it and then have the up and down and then there

that's great wheel drive

three but the channel up channel down and

if it if you go to channel up down to get this later on that as because

vice versa would be carried be downbeat feel completely different you know

completely different you know what you were fiddling with

like a mess with

so we're looking at some ideas for place volume and channel trying

just for the volume that

but on the rooms of a depending on fire

'cause you could have like i dunno a liberal is there look sick you can to control the volume is your thumb and a key control the buttons

but i mean it seems to me that you add it all also i see the dentist a bit of that to look really different and that there's

and the most important aspect is due to the look you have to look fancy

we have strain incorporate so

so that's different than

because i was like a spongy skin and they can just

and they can just went off and

we could if we could save depending on the cost of

and there's just be possible anyone wanna interact a fashion that this

that's the fits in making sufficient quantity

right i think it's easier sometimes to have them by changeable covers for them to buy a whole new one because you don't

but i mean they did it immediately come from our that she's that city's end of the connection and you

new thing the range of a replaceable cover is that in if it doesn't have a cover on that all it'll still territory

is there a fashion accessory

mean to be the basic shape is what we i'm a given that we've

display so that people's that's look at it and then that's a real reaction remote control or one of those

maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold

different shape so they could hold on to it but that way

sorta shape so the in the sort of whole day

anyway so this is sort of a mouse but held

mouse but held in s. a. is a hold in your

a. is a hold in your hand like that and with the eleventh have to do with the buttons

there's a very good point

i think we need to i think we decided that we're actually going to a place where is that in

they just bring it to mess and just

like that it's microphone ask

v. or the contrast is changing

it's it's certainly possible i mean the debris

i mean the debris we going beyond what given these
