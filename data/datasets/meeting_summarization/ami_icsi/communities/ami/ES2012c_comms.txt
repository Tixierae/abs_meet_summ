of buttons on the other people don't use and find
and if you have any buttons there should be very few of them in any for they use functions that are cheating tried to the people use

i'm a given that we've got a warm on off button presumably two buttons of a channel changing one slide and i see nothing else
so i we could have a menu button as we could have that channels
we could have that channels and that power and then a menu button and then the volume so have

and also one of the things that people have used it as a slide button like you have on a mouse the possibly we
the there's a lot of slide button that i think it's pretty much
button that i think it's pretty much the same sort of connection

so three because there's three buttons on the slide three but the channel up
the volume so have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons on the volume

do we need a five buttons the channel changer then volume up down and on off just as a back-up or just so that people can have to sit there pressing buttons
if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and i would do voice commands and
on on silicon most of all the scrolling button is actually buttons but you could press it you can press
you could press it you can press that has a menu button

they've got lots of buttons on the
that we should look at speech recognition of the rubber of the buttons and if you have any buttons
buttons or that seems to be the most cost effective way of producing it
clutter avoid too many buttons and also
and a key control the buttons for your fingers
it like we're leaving out the buttons for that the first recall you we
maybe you can minimise the buttons and still
and we can have it will be in the limitations from inside onto the buttons so
battery life so now women couldn't they make the buttons are having it's actually a unnecessary i think

maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold
different shape so they could hold on to it but that way

they say i just i looked at what exactly the remote still they
and this creates a connection with and the remote that has
as for how we should end up use it as a remote of a warming questions are the buttons are you
was haven't really been used much on remote so there's many chips
in at a t. v. didn't really get away from the the square look at most the current remotes don't know what the

user interface with that we get the voice buttons all database
however to not have buttons are to use a voice commands is the buttons might make these connections more difficult and i raise
it cheaper it's gonna be a mass produce a quite daring get out there faster but it's going to be less
but it's going to be less flexible with the features that she things like a voice activation was haven't really been used
less buttons and it's
we can still incorporate the voice of a less buttons i mean

pick a little picture of what i thought it could look like so just kind of
it's sort of it kind of picturing like maybe a shape that some of like a mouse so that
but do you know the shape of a kind of those lend itself to voices "'cause" if you're holding

so that might be good for volume to just be able to kind of role at it and then have the up and down and then there
i was thinking kind of just for the volume but

and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then
expensive you can say is the voice recognition data is the wood and then
i think if we're gonna have the voice recognition part of it and then we should have a full whole thing
it will have the voice recognition if
and then you can preprogrammed the channels voice recognition and then they push response sample locator

and the most important aspect is due to the look you have to look fancy
look you have to look fancy look-and-feel
it we go over there it looks fancy and fashion supposedly we have to go into but

they way if you press a key or give a voice command and then
what happens is you press a number or give a voice command and this creates
flexibility enable us to incorporate voice function that we all seem to have upon how that's
that the problem is the voice technology is not really highly developed it sort of still in this
i mean do you do we think the voice technologies fundamental to the project
gonna be we start to get away from the voice functional
you we could incorporate that into the voice

and do we know how long it looks like to develop a custom chip
i mean a custom chip
having a any a custom chip but given the you'd
