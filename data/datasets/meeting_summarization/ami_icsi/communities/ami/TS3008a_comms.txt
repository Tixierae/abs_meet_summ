no i didn't we started i just close to
then pen again
is it quite it's a little bit will light
another colour maybe read one
a small one
it's another one i'm not
it's simplicity
hold it so
orange

my name is name
and then we read through the tool training i
controls do you have no good experiences with remote controls were put
i don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls but
different functions of water

know i saw us all the files smartboards that's all weeks we can do that
i'll use this the same sheet
different colours
i have some of its favourite characters i like it's
i think that's kind of what the intention should be

f. five
i'm gonna draw at the right i finished
we're gonna brainstorm about what kind of can borrow a normal remote controls gonna be
but only about your experiences with the remote controls do you have

we have twenty five minutes
project aim is to design a new remote control some of the
design we begin with the functional design and we go to the conceptual design and the details assign every level
every level design consist of some individual work and we close it with the meeting you will receive an email

hope it's working
they can have a pariah no
don't mess with my birds

but for you have get the whole quite as part but we will motel are we all know each other names
we all know each other names ghost
wheels where's the white board i don't know

using right now you can there's a docking for
it's not working like a pain
she can use a pen you can

no just on the screen or whatever
probably is but i don't know it's a software is on a laptop but it's if it's
i'm going to draw a cat

can make new of a new blanks and you can change
on a blank sheet with different colours with different pen widths i'll
i like it's a sharp a razor sharp teeth plus

pressing a forward but you select and format yes like current colour or a line width
and make a new she is by pressing
is by pressing a blank

i'll tell us something about the your favourite characteristics of this particular birds
it's clear
your point it was to be next

that was a bad role
i'll draw a pain when whatever
i like it's admin s. i. and

the selling price of our remote controls gonna be twenty five euros and our
and our profit aim is fifty million euros very
euros very ambitious on this one the market

one thing you have to place and i thought exactly on the marks spot
it's important to place your laptop exactly on the marks for the affair

you with your brilliant ideas i don't know if
ideas i don't know if i can touch the power button

no i like a pitch
i close to that was

i've lost my screen
we have a smart boards that there's those two boards this is

that was that wasn't very smart i come
come on the back to me

welcome to the kickoff meeting i have forget to put
i have forget to put my name of it's

for today the opening is what i'm doing right now
we gonna do some equating is equations things

examples of the tool training project plan discussion and closing we have twenty five
so you can you powerpoint presentations on the screen wheels where's the white

it consists of the tree levels of design
all the buttons which apply to the text functions in one

you will receive an email with the example of a explanation of what particular level of design means to the different functions and only you probably
and only you probably read that's already so i don't

there's a docking for cult she to share documents folder you can
documents folder you can upload your or documents to the folder and then you can open over here so you can you powerpoint

can we see the whiteboard on our laptops know i saw
use a pen you can use an eraser

function is like a very simple page application
i'll try i'll try

we only use the same fell doing a whole day and you can
it's blue or

i we're gonna try out the other twenty white board every participant
every participant should draw its favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics on a blank sheet with

this is just a useless drawings on a t.
whether or not supposed to be green or whatever colour is this

it's the most simple and i know i think i
we get your point

i control so
so you can start to laugh alright

and whatever the weight walks or whatever
you could handle it

the weight walks or whatever your turn
i'm not gonna discuss some were we're

and you can have them at home
which is not this a case with with being wings and

it's handicapped cat
is it most gets a small you could handle

i don't think i don't think that darwin would agree with that
it's you have to get is trying with

worldwide and production cost should be a maximum of twelve euro fifty per remote control so that's
so that's clear to

controls but if you see elderly people all these buttons and then they buy new t. v. because the previous one was talking whatever and
and then a different remote control with different functions on but from places and half of the functions are remove whatever

i've got a touch pad you know how

no my laptop

no try a power button

so there are i close to

i close the

you've got a name

and of course the laptop

it's it's martin

what is the agenda for today

some of the age i object to started it has to be original trendy and user-friendly

goal is

ghost you know on tech

on pick "'em" up

i think we are already been to that part

so i don't have to tell you about that

first we're gonna they're gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here so you get acquainted with these and meeting tools we have a smart boards

boards this is a presentation boards would do which one am using right now you

i don't know skip that

it's if it's mainly you think for in the meeting so i don't think it's i don't know if it's important

is an explanation of the smart boards as

boards as it to war over here

it's quite simple you at

simple you at the pen function razor function is like

and you can make new sheets by but we put the person on the blank button it works like this

it works like this

and you can change the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing a forward but

so it's quite easy

no your role of acquainted with the different tools

i'll start off and i'll use this the

no i mean you some different colour is now

looks like a fish

yellow

plus the big for has an small on small actual face and i like it so

and i like it so overall aggressive look and

once to be next

nobody i

then pen

and so in the format menu you can choose the different colours and pen widths

control

i don't know what my you have favourites animal is but the

is but the easiest animal i can't think this is the birds i will

two three or

it's simplicity

maybe because there's also a three year maybe in the sky or something like that maybe

so they more a bunch of

what have a low next

i haven't got a favourite animal to sell all

pictionary

thank you all draw open and

all it is better menu bird

everything's better than word

what ever it's blue

controlling

i don't know why but i get this a very smart animal

i mean a bird

it's not very very good strong but "'cause" you get from it

you scroll big people sit because of the certainly is

and then we read

i wouldn't call training

this is a something about the project finds the selling price of

the market range of since national so it's gonna be sold worldwide

were put in all you sometimes are they

are they difficult to understand or maybe they don't interact with different kind of like weapons very

so i think what we need is our remote control with

a group buttons you know all the buttons
