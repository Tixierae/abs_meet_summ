the slogan c. g. quite small right they're not
small right they're not like huge so
the buttons about say buttons
that sounds good
to ten cents we do some hikes
but can you change any that is at all
that the pounds
that "'cause" that's fine just need
i that's a it's a week and my
what can i have a look at the excel sheet and price this thing and see if we need to
and see if we need to
and that's because the cost restraints is it
and the case was i mean by single
colours to me soft pop up a know
just one colour
and maybe a special colour for them and so maybe four again
be plastic so
are we going to eat she used this high-end product of
mean four point
that's a good idea
to twenty
larry good so
larry good so on this couch to reach for this we're not gonna have
we're not gonna have the l. c. d. anymore would just gonna
high court and as being about
so can we close that this is what's
be sewn is gonna have to that's fine
because i've seen there's lots of devices that there that instead of taking your standard nine square grade and have it sort of stylised and different concept that
discuss how satisfied we all are with at least four points with the room for
maybe we should do the design evaluation first
or a share what that was
and trendy as quick as possible
set up over here all of the the point of discussion from the beginning can use that as a criteria
and i don't know if yellow's gonna really be hit
a registered up and so whiteboard digital pens the room no of course
i think that it could be i mean it means any means t. v. remote to get rid of and that's the
i'll keep on diff answering
diff answering the question in those terms i'd say that actually there is sort of the keys of creativity because
i'm like your personal coach press and like that to me that

it might even be one a bit more complex l. c. d. panel with pictures like maybe the sound or you know the symbols of the various functions
that's a number pad
it's whatever else we want to introduce then that's functions and then i think that
so you have a v. c. r. e. having you know which input do you have
probably colour sharpness
one and the l. c. display
to be replaced with a regular chip
so what that means is that

you got three now
you can skip straight the channel using these buttons
to have kinetic as no
just report that has to be over budget or the colours
and because when you put on the shelf

the school we're headed that's
i don't think you need a power so
and sweet a really that i think it's gonna
elementary because when we're gonna probably use it to change anything that
by a three do

so instead of this is the
that this can be in the idea of colours is these are these the colours
we're gonna have again that this or for the you know from last time it up when you bit about
else to use the job done

you know it's like it only has four columns it's very simple l. c. d. like or as many
like or as many the minimum amount we need that the usual automatically know like this is brightness this is contrast
that's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one
and maybe a special

and and because we've got the l. c. d. and all that we just thought we'd then you start volume
not if that counts but
maybe closer to three or three
i was it two point five

it's maybe even preprogram someone's like
going singly speech are from one to oval or doubles the sort of thing
so we want double curved it "'kay"
pop up a know it will how

control like a sleek final decision
we're told thinking of style and look and feel in technology but build something for twelve and a half pounds so actually
so actually the creative use more and more like of sort of for from l. a. than actual

you have the space here and you mean
so pretty good
room think it means that you know

is it possible that
i mean like profile
so we can say than to have a possible or

child for volume
you can use it for more advanced functions like contrast colour
we need an advanced chip i think you can

contrast brightness
brightness know
to me to do my design evaluation last

so for this task are here
vance chip we
i'd go with three or four maybe

function you have to intercept so
intercept so forth a good estimate for
first one dimension to the thing which we needed to add and you might want an

star flights a fruit inspired colour design shouldn't
but the i mean it could be a lemon yellow colour it could light
much and as you damages very relaxed but

and all these four points my four point
four point i don't
you got different to

we're gonna discuss the look-and-feel design user interface design and we're gonna evaluate the product and
and the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control like a sleek

i'm then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report so
made at the expense g. and it will be colour expensive to have open up that was a buttons the inside so instead of

down and incorporating the slogan somewhere as i think i missed
it is like a balloon in a cage you can go so big it's not hit the side the constraints

b. c. one very small that access the menu through the scroll wheel and confirm
and button

that's and relaxing to discussed last time
things like brightness contrast

so what kind of thing it's gonna be
the l. c. you can adjust this place function leeway doing choosing in advance

here and you mean you have this thing on the side as or at the bottom
with wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something

right so you would still have plenty of space for so and see that
and say project

are working in it that be but the same size as time and
creativity because or as to work through this but actually the guidelines are fairly can try it in terms of in fashion trends a fruit vegetable colour scheme but then then

so one two three for centimetres past me
i was just to get an idea scale from your phone or china so you can power

six seven eight but nine to
'cause that's one button but it's the complexity of twelve buttons

so we're talking about ten centimetres that would be kids
we had something has to go to the chain of two point three euro so

would be that sounds like a really good size is there
that's great in this very bright as so

is these are these the colours that a production is just what you have available
it's adjust to do is list all the things that it does so i can add on the report

button to all the firm maybe two seconds i'll send a standby signal and apart
and apart from that it's can be used as a confirm button for the l. c. d. screen and to use

and then i think that in specify the
'cause our design of a series of colours that is more like a line we have like sort of a i dunno like the hardest line of the vibrant i don't

a week and my
a case

for this task are here par one is what we got battery to have kinetic as
we only have very sparse

are wanting them and no but
it needs to be more than one big button because if you're gonna be a form and then if there's actually one button underneath it says that kind of itself is single i know

four point three mouse
would just gonna have on to on the t. v. or so you are doing that i think it's for an hour

one the other thing could be that you could take away the l. c. d. and on a bus trip together because
'cause i mean positioning is we're gonna bring into the telephone kind of

do something on the t. v. responds every x. as so
so the user if you look to the t. v. and pushing this thing so we may not

hard can it be something in between
we have point three together just somewhere

normal colour buttons
i feel i "'cause" i wear my glasses right and that but that irritating you write it in

the buttons only refer to the pad so
so at this point we

take that off
it's factor show so

so then these just become normal clock buttons that
that might be some way of cutting the cost

sort of flat as possible
then they should of thing i'm quite deep sort of

two is not very high at all the user hi
slightly more than two so

it's probably just an innocence was getting
i think that's something that's very hard to catch so you

that fast as an entirely what use this reading that but you
alright so the way this works so i'm going to plug in the powerpoint and trendy

great i and i'm gonna write up r. results on the boards
the forty niners with zero being high yes

montana
just a thing is the question in terms of the first point or the room because

but i would say two or three
what's the scale one to seven right

high tech innovation
if you like a cage to within or whatever it is like

i mean it's really basic taking is nine
like give an area one

hundred pound hand
cameras that

just thinking about what we were considered
i it's leading the evaluation criteria or and i don't

i think to record it and i can ask just a minute
this one if i need to include in the minutes because if it's a very

next that then because it and fine downs is the project evaluation
i'm this thing and just can incorporate the logo winter the things one thing that the players

resume reality is it onto this is not reasonably created it's more just
what to do you feel it that you're able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing

actually let's take each point and everybody discuss everything at its is still on
at its is still on the topic of room for creativity next on the screen

you write it in it does actually you know affect how we believe you comfortable to communicate i feel i am hiding behind
i feel i am hiding behind the equipment run and in common is helping me and you know

and the time given also restricts
what applied leadership

i don't know if that means like if i get kicked over something i don't really know
i mean my sense on

we'll all sacked right

if they are kind of detailed design meeting

just from last time to recap said we're gonna

said we're gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no l. c. d. display new need for top bracket so if you're

bracket so if you're gonna be kinetic power on battery with rubber buttons maybe park

maybe park lighting the buttons with some internal leds to shine through the casing hopefully a job

hopefully a job down and

i think i missed

it if you want to present your prototype go ahead

ninja home are made in japan

not be changes made

this is the l. c. d. screen the start of a b. c. one very small

and there is an that it doesn't open up to the advanced functions so the advanced functions

so the advanced functions are still hidden from here but they're hidden in the sense that the nine years

doing choosing in advance function that like brightness contrast whatever they were just say you know it's like it

so number pen is

where we're gonna have the slogan

belongs

about say buttons about the size right so

so if this isn't a scale what kind of that mentions are you thinking about here

one of the buttons you don't have to be if using the fingers are working

so that would be a bus and i'm here for a button so one

past me half or five

don't know in total

but nine to know

and they get in fact a pen there's about ten centimetres easily so that

so that would be that sounds

the button and

the button and the colours read that sort of a problem when use as as me power button to all the firm maybe

so it's like an button

we discussed how high it is but how why is it

no i was in the height but what about the way

team five ten years

like that but the actual thing

do we need five i don't think fine have you got three now

so you can power on and off what else

we're gonna have one control here and and because

know and enough

and enough

if the designers what are they

i'll open a t. v. d.

maybe tuning the channels

channel to any skin

what else the very simple so you have a v. c.

colour sharpness

sharpness a lot of these things we'll have to be free and open for users to define them

what about a sound settings but

what do we have like your basic you base your mid-range a high range

like the user could determine like a series of some woods and what

woods and what could happen would be when you click on that and go to setting

that's fine just need to me so i can write a time

if we need to rethink anything at all so

just backtrack

we need and

what about the electronics or advanced

the case was i mean by single and double to you know

is there any rubber at all and the buttons and

i think we're gonna have to skip the rubber

and we want to special colours to me soft

it will how many colours are not there

for the case itself one colour it's one special colour

'cause the case units of first american wants go on top of it

so interface wise is it this is there an option we have the two of them now

them buttons we have watched two colours

no we have them got some pushbuttons as

we've got push buttons as

like always say a push button on integrated scroll-wheel push

working got one button for this thing is just one big she rubber

so why we're adding at the number for what is a number

what is a number four come from

right sir and for

so we just estimating that would be less

sir and for

as a everything gonna be plastic

so we're who quite for over a are gonna something's gonna

a are gonna something's gonna have to care we're at

we're at sixteen point it and

three mouse is on

we could take a wonderful meeting is single curve just films but

much for that save us know he's if you

so we may not need to so when we scroll

so when we scroll we need to some way to get the t. v. to respond which i think is a technically

which i think is a technically doable thing so

so what thirty eight suggestion

take away the l. c. display

and the advanced chip goes away as

and so we've got point three each get rid of

we had where the for the pushbuttons are where exactly nine

the twelve buttons that you see there

twelve buttons

assembled is a rubber base can have twelve buttons and any so

you can actually cut off it's like three times

it's like three times the number buttons for it twelve

i it's not one big button or is it twelve buttons hard

or the colours you could take a waste colours for the buttons

what do you want colour differentiation here

no that's not a button were talking about that's

and right so today that completely

so today that completely small

small an hour and

an hour and about to say

about to say we do have point five euro to play with that we wanted to

no but with them boss in the logo is not going to cost us some money

i can probably kinds of a special form for buttons

does that mean no one button has a special form or

moment is just one button to twenty

that i think it's for an hour and so this

and so this is gonna be one big thing here

was the goal in your prototype design it'd be as a low profile as possible

deep sort of did not be completely important and one being boring flat

we didn't have enough data to make it a three d.

and you might want an inner life with

so just to be fair then with wise

and then so hyped why is

about that thing about to send to use

to send to use

tape but i think

so you have a within cost anyway

say project evaluation is this point

that this is what's the final status gonna be sewn

that's fine

an innocence was getting into but

but just an then we will this be stylish which we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grade because i've

so you restrict the number of people wanna try something the look and the colours

the look and the colours something which is call i

call i think there's also that factor of it's two one familiar and

what about buttons shape square buttons

square buttons

button shaped might be a good idea to change rather than positioning "'cause" i mean positioning

this thing discuss

with the room for creativity in the project and leadership and teamwork have

and teamwork have to we have to run to say yes

a case that fast as an entirely

is on the school we're headed that's

no the power cord itself so then

so then you have it more freedom to

he used to using h.

so what this is the sole for us to use kinda like a

the ideas that set up over here

can use that as a criteria evaluation for the for the current design and the plan and sweet

i think it's gonna end up being for elementary because

results on the boards as a be way for us to go through and decide if we're on to review where we stand

to sort of bring together two things are design goals and also the market research so we have we rate

we rate this one is high in succeeding or fitting to our original in and seven is

is so the ease of use it

so the ease of use it there and then

there and then we then asked to to collectively rate is so we can use

rate is so we can use trying just to work on a consensus system so

we just come to an agreement so

so the first one there stylish look and feel

or it that pretty handy

i mean compared to most remote controls you say that's pretty good it's a resonator

a resonator six or something what is anything else and

my only reservation that was that we one and yellow because it's the company's colour and i don't

i would say five or six good

that's good five and

four it's actually the opposite

it's one to seven right

see you soon and

soon and three

one is high

one side of it

get a three

get a three

'kay two point

two point five then

control

that's only job data but

we had a remove so

we'd have to remove few of our features we wanted the

we wanted the job done

or four maybe three

but going to what the little bit higher than medium kind of thing

three

the three

design shouldn't say colour but just

they yellow is more representative of a colour but the

of a colour but the button this off the blue can be anything else

the design a simple to use some point features

that's fine

soft and spongy we achieve that we

we achieve that we use mostly plastic in the end it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price five

there are five

a three do

like you said plastic to bother me

plastic to bother me

could really is an entirely rubber frame to as an option

i mean it would be cost prohibitive

but increase the cost of them

would cost more than plastic

the cost of them got think what ten cents left so

logo we got in that way

can have the on the side and then there's something

and it's within budget this is a

under forty nine

to use so many and fifteen point five

translate to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy our original goal

i think "'cause" if you turn that into the a hundred would be about

twice that's about it flashy

that's thirty one and then infer

about it flashy one

and then infer that it's

so but sixty nine seventy percent

right that's the only need

good i was just a little formality for us to go through

yes hundred

maybe thoughts on this day

is that you all finished to

that's me i did have one other one other frame i thought i mean i've

i thought i mean i've not knowing how we deal with this information i thought

i thought in c. read is kind of process would be that refining our design revisiting original goals it's not

it's not gonna need to push through but i thought

through but i thought it was thinking more about the dimensions sort of like more three-dimensional shapes as as opposed to just that flat "'cause" our design of

of the vibrant i don't know something whatever

just something you know we have different phones lined green one and it's just discussion

i mean i was doing just abandon this is fine

or and i don't know instructions of thing

just in case you want to see something with play-doh

do you wanna just individually say you think about use four points and all

i like this project he was that the two little buttons like that's it's really crack

a resonator what do this

alphabetically hand

hand through the summer had true

so what is it you're asking me now

i think there is an your opinion on these for these four point three in high we used and

i sort of our work on settings are

that's good to your system and the room

the room is really institutional but

but the main thing is i think i use the space is more just a report on things as opposed to be creative and constructor then it

then it would probably help to to have a sort of a cue know the fact of we have ideas that we come back in any ideas are still in discussion you know as in other words is

know as in other words is this really sort of a sender point of creativity resume

or the room because of the creativity goes on with the enemy come here and we kind of put other ideas and then you know

i'd i it's a real as in this room think

alright room for a registered

scheme but then then we'd want to use a cab company colours

so it really we're told

within the constraints the

the constraints the

hit the side the constraints to come in a thought

so i actually let's take each

i agree with this point

it's gotta find their go through and then you start at the end can go write a kind of thing i "'cause" without a might

adding another point is that the meetings i'm more brainstorming sessions then meeting so time

so time is also they just strong factor in structure because for brainstorm

because for brainstorm meeting you wanna structures that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed to be evaluated and reviewed and if you can come back and

come back and i that point about the room not being a refrain need to that i think that's a very big thing i think that were wearing

i think that were wearing these things this tricks i feel i "'cause" i wear

see and i'm more relaxed atmosphere would be more gonna can use it to create a store there

not so much and as you damages

very relaxed but they're big deer

but actual environment

you know it creates boundaries to that and

my sense on a sort of what kind of guidance and direction encouragement

from in you as the thing is an acting team leader

i think it's good i mean my personal views on leadership was effective leadership sort of gives people a certain room for freedom delegation but then come back

but then come back something that they take great ownership and

innovative thought we have in
