'cause that's one button but it's the complexity of twelve buttons
the twelve buttons that you see there
twelve buttons
it's like three times the number buttons for it twelve
i it's not one big button or is it twelve buttons hard

mean four point
four point three mouse
and all these four points my four point
four point i don't
i think there is an your opinion on these for these four point three in high we used and

what about buttons shape square buttons
square buttons

the buttons about say buttons
about say buttons about the size right so
one of the buttons you don't have to be if using the fingers are working
so that would be a bus and i'm here for a button so one
that's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one
no that's not a button were talking about that's
the buttons only refer to the pad so
moment is just one button to twenty
i like this project he was that the two little buttons like that's it's really crack

we're at sixteen point it and
we had something has to go to the chain of two point three euro so
and so we've got point three each get rid of
we have point three together just somewhere
say project evaluation is this point
i agree with this point

made at the expense g. and it will be colour expensive to have open up that was a buttons the inside so instead of
the button and the colours read that sort of a problem when use as as me power button to all the firm maybe
them buttons we have watched two colours
normal colour buttons
of a colour but the button this off the blue can be anything else

it needs to be more than one big button because if you're gonna be a form and then if there's actually one button underneath it says that kind of itself is single i know
i can probably kinds of a special form for buttons
does that mean no one button has a special form or

bracket so if you're gonna be kinetic power on battery with rubber buttons maybe park
is there any rubber at all and the buttons and
working got one button for this thing is just one big she rubber
assembled is a rubber base can have twelve buttons and any so

we're actually just each of us discussing something that you need your own mind it wasn't
the television the else you need to discuss

the ideas that set up over here
if he's got some ideas setting up could talk that would mean a lot easier

we've got push buttons as
like always say a push button on integrated scroll-wheel push

three mouse is on
you can actually cut off it's like three times
maybe closer to three or three
soon and three
do we which we two or three continue our

that this can be in the idea of colours is these are these the colours
is these are these the colours that a production is just what you have available
just report that has to be over budget or the colours
or the colours you could take a waste colours for the buttons
what do you want colour differentiation here
the look and the colours something which is call i
scheme but then then we'd want to use a cab company colours

set up over here all of the the point of discussion from the beginning can use that as a criteria
actually let's take each point and everybody discuss everything at its is still on
and it's completely you know and abstract from the final product that they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around puzzle and pointing discuss and in

i was just to get an idea scale from your phone or china so you can power
then it would probably help to to have a sort of a cue know the fact of we have ideas that we come back in any ideas are still in discussion you know as in other words is
or the room because of the creativity goes on with the enemy come here and we kind of put other ideas and then you know
and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that i know that people
city think producing a prototype earlier in the process would've been a good idea
what i did a that it for this a new ideas find
that's kind of a new idea for me is like this or that idea you
wonderful idea are
