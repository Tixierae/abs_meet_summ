i was it two point five
two point five then
to use so many and fifteen point five

what about buttons shape square buttons
square buttons

what i did a that it for this a new ideas find
that's kind of a new idea for me is like this or that idea you

'cause that's one button but it's the complexity of twelve buttons
the twelve buttons that you see there
twelve buttons
assembled is a rubber base can have twelve buttons and any so
it's like three times the number buttons for it twelve
i it's not one big button or is it twelve buttons hard

i'd go with three or four maybe
or four maybe three

the buttons about say buttons
about say buttons about the size right so
one of the buttons you don't have to be if using the fingers are working
so that would be a bus and i'm here for a button so one
you can skip straight the channel using these buttons
no that's not a button were talking about that's
the buttons only refer to the pad so
so then these just become normal clock buttons that
moment is just one button to twenty

made at the expense g. and it will be colour expensive to have open up that was a buttons the inside so instead of
the button and the colours read that sort of a problem when use as as me power button to all the firm maybe
them buttons we have watched two colours
normal colour buttons
of a colour but the button this off the blue can be anything else

we had something has to go to the chain of two point three euro so
four point three mouse
three mouse is on
and so we've got point three each get rid of
we have point three together just somewhere
i think there is an your opinion on these for these four point three in high we used and

it needs to be more than one big button because if you're gonna be a form and then if there's actually one button underneath it says that kind of itself is single i know
i can probably kinds of a special form for buttons
does that mean no one button has a special form or

we're actually just each of us discussing something that you need your own mind it wasn't
the television the else you need to discuss

we've got push buttons as
like always say a push button on integrated scroll-wheel push

you know it's like it only has four columns it's very simple l. c. d. like or as many
that's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one
and maybe a special colour for them and so maybe four again
what is a number four come from
mean four point
four it's actually the opposite
do you wanna just individually say you think about use four points and all
and all these four points my four point
four point i don't

that this can be in the idea of colours is these are these the colours
is these are these the colours that a production is just what you have available
it will how many colours are not there
or the colours you could take a waste colours for the buttons
what do you want colour differentiation here
design shouldn't say colour but just
creativity because or as to work through this but actually the guidelines are fairly can try it in terms of in fashion trends a fruit vegetable colour scheme but then then
scheme but then then we'd want to use a cab company colours

we're at sixteen point it and
know as in other words is this really sort of a sender point of creativity resume
actually let's take each point and everybody discuss everything at its is still on
i agree with this point
with them and so it is leadership was the point of sort of just empowering the the team member so
supply gonna pointing spend a whole we sell off time doing that and
and i think that the very start to die a like rosa rita didn't take new point one then went back

what can i have a look at the excel sheet and price this thing and see if we need to
if we need to rethink anything at all so
we need an advanced chip i think you can
first one dimension to the thing which we needed to add and you might want an
i don't think you need a power so
it's not gonna need to push through but i thought
this one if i need to include in the minutes because if it's a very
come back and i that point about the room not being a refrain need to that i think that's a very big thing i think that were wearing
