do we need buttons
we still need the buttons in the same place is that anyway

they shouldn't be too many buttons on the small remote control which are a bit too complicated
so that they would know how to use these remote controls
just i think of one to think of a remote control
a remote control
a remote control
it's a maze to remote controls is graphical interface where you
remote control because it defines the
we could make novelty remote controls
as for the energy source you know almost every remote control is just batteries but we'll

but the thing is when use remote control you never look at it right
when do this is we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls see how they work
so at looking inside a very simple remote control

it just seems kind of like a i need this
so this is kind i. d. the bare essentials that we need to have a remote control because
them i as a nation you do need the remote

we can just have a remote control and casings of different shapes different fruit

i like the colour for buttons as
like "'cause" it's gonna be the cover the rubber all the plastic casing and then the buttons and property two different colours or
and then we'll colour for the buttons
i quite like them only colour buttons or so

controls by things stand that kind of and shape and up in a in this kind of button buttons like
seems quite easy to like at the different shapes of the buttons and i think that's a
i'm buttons would do we stay different shapes of buttons
you have any that should that sort of engineered so we ended up make it different difficult shape it's for cruelty

i think in a the name of a some kind of
of a some kind of you know it's like look like los name and kind of thing i don't know the name

so it these are the some of the pictures of existing ones has to look through
you do your apple-shaped look so
look so in that way you can have any is whatever you want without
i mean if you think about it if they're wanting it "'cause" they want to look at it if they using it and what they wanna look at is facing we from doesn't really
try to look in the screen
looks like please

button buttons like that the top right so on and off or something i think people
the middle button
looks quite space eighty bit too many buttons i think on that one
but the buttons on this i think odd it's just
so multicoloured buttons
no wonder if they mean like to actually make it sort of buttons and everything

so is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip is it
i dunno other standards over kind of

good that's all we kind of predict that
do you think like rubber would be good odds are really want you know channel kind of
it does like kind of dangerous
it's still got to get the kind of twelve fifty you know
will have come in contact with that kind of use
it's kind of got be are companies you know so again i mean
that's i think is the more you move it's got we thing inside it just kind of powers it out
like with those watches be kind of test
at all we're kind of what kind of can you have just deleted

so i think for a remote control there is some inconsistency
there is some inconsistency already nick existing in between remote controls by things

it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make of
much of a gimmick that something economically shape and organic like it to hold based on fruits and natural things like that because all already

everything but it's pointing out that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down but it would actually go up because of the shape so
we could make of vegetable you kind of round shape i think
in the shape they will just make it kind of mixed and matched type shape or
