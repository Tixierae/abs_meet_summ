no the first one you see
you see d. outlook of them or why do you should have a fancy or two as a
do we must have some technology that it was meant in the remote control that other than just putting it as it is as the other or a remote control so it should
so that endeared somewhere technological advancement and
fruit and veg
i mean the one thing think about these ones is these secure areas and i've seen a lot of them with the cover missing so like other hand
it do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the
so even if we include either of course with the rid of it you know some remotes and we give something new technology got are the ones where and as as new design it fancy outlook i think we really need the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market
i'm not if that at twenty five euros a cat or twelve years fifteen manufacturing course
i mean i would know about the cost of them
but price and price not withstanding is it too complicated it's it can be too much just overloaded
and one is the white board is "'cause" we haven't used
is "'cause" we haven't used it
the yellow incorporated
i think in a the name of a some kind of

when we did the fashions this and fashion the holidays and fashion update shows that
interface where you have cops buttons and you point to it rather than having the output is a stream of text or something
that's threatening
the people tend
i think that's a good idea scary for
this remote costs nothing
so that takes the signals from the buttons in translates into the sequence of courses that it then sends the amplifier which is
was a people i dunno
'cause that you can hold it in like boston bit and
'cause we've got that technological innovation with the speech recognition system
watchers you know the fruits all around them i

in a very you know findings we have seen that when we did other
the last one is most important one is
excuse me
the interface specification what people
exactly maybe double
like a an hour glass half ago so we're thinking
we could make novelty remote controls
and a lemon might be a little hard to great
it doesn't matter which any point i we could have

a remote control
them this so and it is that a voice recognition and
so necessary at the outer casing which you have to decide
yellow
half ago so we're thinking of for just
already point to it what
so it's sunday

don't think that will that sell very
so that's and they user interface
the buttons like
i. d. show rather than an idea
so spongy banana
they can work from you don't have

of it at like think of a fruit that could sit and then we and so on like a know an apple
a yellow apple's are
i quite like the shape i quite like the design of that because that could sit
look if somebody wanted a nap but if we were designed that even put we report apple-shaped casing on that you do your apple-shaped
you do your apple-shaped look so
look so in that way you can have any is whatever you want without

so what are our findings in a very
"'cause" you and we have any harm to the environment also because our company
fruit and veg where you just i think of
and know whether any factors the ones important than the seven eight that they said we don't want
would be good just you program it like you say you record and then play you and then the court time she and like that so that's

like a i would too much go complicated they shouldn't
i was just thinking the self same thing
so is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip is it
i mean i forgot it would serve
fashion thought was trendy

has to look through them this
i mean is that not so if this is the blink or something is a
don't do it a point to watch t. v. but if
you open up there's a circuit board inside
so this is kind i. d. the bare essentials that we need to have a remote control because

the middle button
he and it's it just seems kind of like
you know we have a bunch of options from wood or titanium rubber plastic or not
i mean like play-doh latex as a kinda spongy feel do it doesn't
is very plasticky for

but the buttons on this i think odd it's just
odd it's just a rainy how you can have different buttons don't feel the
and then we'll throw in our new innovations keep rolling budget
almost a key thing
things are always used

v.s and everything so maybe the small
but i mean like i have the black and white i it just doesn't like funky and
the buttons
and i think if this you software for the same recognition is that you keep on keep in the microphone
so should microphone be does anyone on it or

and the child friendly at easy to use it
seems quite easy to like at the different shapes of the buttons and i think that's a
i mean we are marketing to sort of thirty five to thirty five so most people
i dunno other standards over kind of
other parts or

better than having a functional look and feel so good so this
so this shit this clearly indicates that preference for the design the outlook of the remote controls so
so we should take into so we should
so we should consider this vector is the most important factor of

and that are the most important aspect in the data to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use like a i would
and there's a chip roster the t. a.
there we cost pennies
what about a scroll wheel and speech recognition

controls by things stand that kind of and shape and up in a in this kind of button buttons like
and this one is just pointing out i like some
i like some of these things the raised symbols everything but it's pointing
and that means you get the bomb that to the t. v. makers

and we got some pictures of some a new remote controls to show you that press
we could have a lot leds in each and
of a some kind of you know it's like look like los name and kind of thing i don't know the name
i don't know the name of that

strange
they listen to it
when do this is we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls see how they work
far i mean we are pushing it probably bit funny fruitshaped the wanna

that could that's a bit confusing but
so most people
will have come in contact with that kind of use
it's so there'd be able

so you as much switching over just left of my first two screens that
and that's really easy to use bright so
i could put the microphone

beep or a dave and feel of the material is expected to be spongy the other than just having a plastic look a hard look
good that's all we kind of predict that
so that could play v. d. player and it we're handling it so

and then f. five right
so for the casing this email i got from our manufacturing team
latex

good it's a bit of imagination the
so there so the findings so we need to combine
it on this so we have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just have that kind of fruit a shape

and that's the kind what you were going for this
everything but it's pointing out that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down but it would actually go up because of the shape so
so multicoloured buttons

it does like kind of dangerous
size quite
i think maybe just to roll on the kind of fruit and vegetables shape and

of course yellow
colours or it if we have important actually that and
i'll make is fifty

and i just got an email from our technical department saying that they have broken three would certainly speech recognition software that you can programme and
but we're sponge i is it on their work and it's
i mean those ideas i so would just for inspiration i think

the race symbols little good the l. c.
the l. c. d. it doesn't make small but i think maybe for all up but it do you think that would
we really need really gonna need to hold it if it's gonna be voice recognition

that's that they that's sort of comfortable to hold easy to hold so you don't drop it
what about a banana
i could have a big banana shaped remote control "'cause" yellow

so maybe in an unidentified all fruit or five or a fruit or vegetable like
maybe maybe it's actually symmetric
like what's that i think in a the name

it got a minute "'cause" standard sort of intuitive
speech recognition i think so we need
what are we the scroll wheel does give ease of use

was we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit
so like other hand show them so clip-on right

they shouldn't be too many buttons on the small remote control which are a bit too complicated
roster the t. a. one eight three five which on their see the input from the buttons and she

have to because the you can see how people have a later date clothes shoes and furniture everything that fruit and veggie day was causing the
'kay here's the competition i suppose

becoming more and more organic really
so at looking inside a very simple remote control

in the top
and beep or a

do you think like rubber would be good odds are really want you know channel kind of
d. thing which we thought could look

a remote control
and the child

some comedy
reuse that the final kind of essential pieces of it and then

like scrolling that fourth of
easy to use it seems quite easy to like

one or you scroll it and then when you reach the sort of a menu item that you require you pressed the middle of a scroll right
but the one to lay that it's got like a little scroll function on the side but i presume

but i presume that the functions was come up on the t. v. screen
so it's just a few ideas then

it's got a program that c. function we talked about you can
but the thing is when use remote control you never look at it right

so maybe that could be built into one things and it comes up on the t. v. or something and this one
and this one big oversized one i

f. five
i mean there's also comes to shape as mean if we are

handy
i quite like them only colour buttons or so

right you know a market survey we have seen that people are we doing to be able to but they want the choir
we can do some user tested scroll-wheels

the children it's a good shape and
so can we make them to promote any size we like or is there a minimum or

we could make of vegetable you kind of round shape i think
that what they were data shows that so this

so since we're going for the but those are the company colours i think the lemon wasn't that far i have it doesn't work you
that would allow the order that

have it doesn't work you know we just made a lemon
i'll give you the this i technical considerations for those

i there are a lot of options are gonna have to choose from one
looks like it

right so this is what we need to have for certain
because that do we want it like quite often

processor are more pro use a more advanced processor than i had and find transmitter
latex double curved curve

so what stress is what we think
it does seem to but i can tell that should be

so the base that sort of plastic initial plastic with a latex can she
like a mouse

you know with that could be a bit of a kinetic like it's good to hold on
and that might be quite durable and easy to talk around

or yellow or maybe even just alone italy colour so it doesn't look too childish perhaps
the be comfy a you know

sponginess
or vegetable like so to have a stand perhaps and

so it look like this can
i get bored ones or squash something or

i will be happy to do that
the best way

from you don't have to hold it
do we need buttons

we can make them think of fruit
them i as a nation you do need the remote

you said about the space of all of the people wants baseball things so we could
like if this is like if this is a more wider for a banana design caving in such a way like half of what we need not to have a full colour we will just have a half of colour

so do we wanna that same format as last time so you as

mail to use the minutes of the last meeting just to save time

and is there any questions you have to rise the last meeting that

particular bother me

then we still stuck with a presentation right

in this meeting i'm going to discuss what the trend watching how this

how this trend is going to affect a remarkable attention and how important is it is so we have

so we have to look on this

first of all methodology they might

they might lead to do it in to find out that and was into the lower than in a way we have done it

we have done it is it not only these a remote control market so there but we also considered the greatest threat fashion trends of the market was

when we did other remote control market so we found that people will people do have preference for a those fancy more one of the remote control switch look and feel a vote better than having

factor of this vector it is twice as important the second factor which

the second factor which is for that to do is they as important as the side so the third factor so

factor so this vector one of the most important factor in others are in our market means and take in designing our our remote controls

as a fancy design

other than just having a functional look and feel good you should have a fancy look and for the feel good the second

the second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically a you know where do we must

so it should be technologically innovative like glow in the dark or speech recognition or something like that so

which are a bit too complicated and it like this and it should we

and it should we and customers

and customers should be provided with the mental state is easy to understand in the local language something so that

so that they would know how to use these remote controls

i was really think fruit and vegetables how to know how we're going

how to know how we're going to incorporate that

was causing the world is not changing use ten plus organic becoming

should make a big sponge one and it

and it be yellow was

ja

it so they should also taken into consideration so these are

so these are my views so

the spongy not real spongy can

can do you think like rubber

r. l. the data but it is good for have ten which is quite this for the one that we can begin to go "'cause"

quite this baseball

because our company is very light up there for taking all this concerns into consideration so

so we don't want to have any harmful to society as

just i think of one to think of a remote control

is a winner and find out a that's fine and

so the interface concept

what people and how they interact

and how they interact with that i think

so the method we did the existing designs one of the

what's good about them what's bad at them

let's have to also going to look at it

also going to look at it was everything and

and what's in just have a told is and what we think would be good it's

the findings of got some pictures to say

it's a maze to remote controls is graphical interface where you

and we also found that is inconsistent layout which makes it confusing so

so i think for a remote control there is some inconsistency

there is some inconsistency already nick existing in between remote controls by things

button buttons like that the top right so on and off or something i think people

or something i think people find that important "'cause" and it's easy to use

show you that press escape f. five or just it's "'kay"

and i just escape should

so it these are the some of the pictures of existing ones has to look through

that's pretty complicated

could look get a bit confusing in the expenses first this one is

this one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse which

it's kinda like scrolling that

like you would do it computes come

fourth of like in the right one of the same thing and from one or you scroll

a few ideas then that's quite boring shape great looks quite space

looks quite space eighty bit too many buttons i think on that one

that's like it looks like so we have a "'kay"

t. k. it's and it's quite an organic a chef and the

chef and the little circle and that's pretty and that's

bright so i like this for a design i think

i think something like that would be good of course yellow

i don't know about you but i think it's a bit too gimmick i don't think

they listen

don't feel the same size quite

the people tend to recognise shapes to do certain things and

so we need to combine those ones and i just

i was just in time very handy and

i think maybe incorporating that in a sign would be good just you

up as a preference is just a imagination the race symbols

and the speech recognition setting would actually

setting would actually going for speech recognition a way

but they want the choir do they want a fancy look they want some new design something new and

it's still got to get the kind of twelve fifty you know

although i mean today to be they have got i mean they are going crazy with the l. c. d. technology notes of that you've

of that you've got your l. c. d. t. v.s and everything so maybe

and parts i mean like even mobile phones whatever have that colour l. c. d. screens it's

it will be easy because there will be on l. c. d. c. display in the room a different friend i "'cause" you can just critical whatever the war

you look and he and

it just seems kind of like a i need this

and one of the survey findings was that they want to easy to use a i think i'm not about the l. c. d. it it's quite

c. d. it it's quite a good idea but

a good idea but for but and for the thing we tried before easy to use it's not the thing which before i think charge friends i

charge friends i thought this as good as you pointed out

as you pointed out the

the but it often goes missing especially the children

it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make of

so which i shall i

i know carets

the order that is

i like the colour for buttons as

and the mouse one i thought it was a good idea because

it was a good idea because people use mile mice mouse is now with the scrolling thing

so there'd be able to use that and as i said i think it up

as i said i think it up she would come up on the screen so

take this out

keep rolling budget

magic

that's what they sent me

very cheap remote this remote costs

which is made of some transistors and amplifiers are times and

and then i get sent to the the l. e. d. light which you

which you can see the little red light bulb at the end and that

and that sends out the infrared lights signal to the television writers

remote control because it defines the

now i'm in this very old one so now the new technology this as a man we small and cheap thing to make

which you have to decide you know what's gonna be on the board

on the board we have to use b. c. at the same setup processor

and find transmitter a standard

i'm not about sponge

work and it's

it and that would call significant durability and

and that's also if it's a relatively cheap to cast

so the base

so i hear a plastic

i like the rubber it be a stress-ball so i think you know with that could be a bit

the colours yellow right

or at least incorporating

like "'cause" it's gonna be the cover the rubber all the plastic casing and then the buttons and property two different colours or

so yellow for the body and

and then we'll colour for the buttons

you do have ones like playing could be green or on and off as reds and like that

makes it easy to use

as mean if we are going to make an oval i mean

make an oval i mean double curved send it to me if we're talking about three or can we can easy use

so the shape we wanna go how exactly maybe

'cause yellow fruit right

but i had you point to

i appreciate this idea because then this

because then this they say that it was a know there are days when those and

are days when those and we can a lady that fruit and veg a day was to be process is that what they were data

rubber don't know o. k. a.

and what else as you say about fashion thought was

and the fashion their shows that fruit and veggie there was a people

and spongy

and as a clear top and bottom so i you could say you know transmits from this and

i'll make is fifty million euros

but related by advertising or

so double curved single curved with you

we can do something we can designed to share then we can have a public some of the led to probably choose what they want

that's a good man there's a good idea

i since you're the marketing

i'm buttons would do we stay different shapes of buttons

best way for a specific functions you know all that in a play stop it got a minute

with the scroll wheel or no

so we need a microphone presently

i would put it's sort of substantially so it's

can be sort of held and we really need

so i was don't use the whiteboard anymore

what about the glow in the dark think the strip around that we just need that

just need that

so maybe it's just gonna bit too far i mean we

is "'em" pick it

the wanna sort of overkill

especially we can lie

what i mean how good is a speech recognition thing do we want to go

thing do we want to go for buttons at all do

for buttons at all do we want to just have a device that maybe sets and pretend it's a fruit

beep that the fruit bowl

you know and then you just saw i mean like

i mean like everybody's got a fruit bowl from the telly

it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers you know

it's just apple's sort of a yellow

because that could sit on a say in that and it's quite got a quite a steady pace

and does it say we need we do wanna be too meticulous with the fruit things

but but the speech thing it doesn't have to be hand held a closed you can set a

you can set a distance and it's

gives you the options

we can just have a remote control and casings of different shapes different fruit

different fruit shape so in such a way that any giving can you could be fit into this more way to do the please so

the please so whatever people want like if somebody wanted in banana shaped we will put that case we want to that war waveform it

so a selection of casing

it will look and

can affect if this was first the marketing

'cause you said about this baseball to me

so we could do that like a choice

is somebody wants it there in banana shape realistic banana shaped giving want to that so it will give a banana shape look if somebody wanted
