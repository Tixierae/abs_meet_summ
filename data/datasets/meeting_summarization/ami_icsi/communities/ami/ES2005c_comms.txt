do we need buttons
we still need the buttons in the same place is that anyway

do we must have some technology that it was meant in the remote control that other than just putting it as it is as the other or a remote control so it should
they shouldn't be too many buttons on the small remote control which are a bit too complicated
so that they would know how to use these remote controls
just i think of one to think of a remote control
a remote control
a remote control
it's a maze to remote controls is graphical interface where you
remote control because it defines the
we could make novelty remote controls

but the thing is when use remote control you never look at it right
when do this is we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls see how they work
so at looking inside a very simple remote control

i could have a big banana shaped remote control "'cause" yellow
we can just have a remote control and casings of different shapes different fruit

i think in a the name of a some kind of
of a some kind of you know it's like look like los name and kind of thing i don't know the name

controls by things stand that kind of and shape and up in a in this kind of button buttons like
the middle button
i like the colour for buttons as
so that takes the signals from the buttons in translates into the sequence of courses that it then sends the amplifier which is
and then we'll colour for the buttons
i quite like them only colour buttons or so
so multicoloured buttons
no wonder if they mean like to actually make it sort of buttons and everything

but the buttons on this i think odd it's just
odd it's just a rainy how you can have different buttons don't feel the
seems quite easy to like at the different shapes of the buttons and i think that's a
i'm buttons would do we stay different shapes of buttons

good that's all we kind of predict that
it does like kind of dangerous
it's still got to get the kind of twelve fifty you know
it just seems kind of like a i need this
will have come in contact with that kind of use
it's kind of got be are companies you know so again i mean
like with those watches be kind of test
like a hand like what it is portable phones kind of thing
at all we're kind of what kind of can you have just deleted

everything but it's pointing out that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down but it would actually go up because of the shape so
it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make of
we could make of vegetable you kind of round shape i think

so this is kind i. d. the bare essentials that we need to have a remote control because
them i as a nation you do need the remote

so it these are the some of the pictures of existing ones has to look through
could look get a bit confusing in the expenses first this one is
looks quite space eighty bit too many buttons i think on that one
but they want the choir do they want a fancy look they want some new design something new and
look so in that way you can have any is whatever you want without
think so half of that will be look be
i mean if you think about it if they're wanting it "'cause" they want to look at it if they using it and what they wanna look at is facing we from doesn't really
said they want something that looks fancy and i think
looks like please

so is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip is it
i dunno other standards over kind of

so i think for a remote control there is some inconsistency
there is some inconsistency already nick existing in between remote controls by things

i was really think fruit and vegetables how to know how we're going
i think maybe just to roll on the kind of fruit and vegetables shape and
so maybe in an unidentified all fruit or five or a fruit or vegetable like

very cheap remote this remote costs
this remote costs nothing
