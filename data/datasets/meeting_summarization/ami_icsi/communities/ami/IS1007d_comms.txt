and that so this is my remote control comes up read its charger
so and if you want to charge a battery you just put the remote control like that to peg in the charger r. and
can produce a set remote control for about for that out
that you can have that true but i do your remote control you
remote control you if you if you want to have more power on what you do and we channel you want to choose and so on
so these are the of the criteria up on which we are going to be a little remote so
since i mean the this study people are more had to like small to have a spongy i remote control that
i think it should be better if we have all these want to use in the same remote control because maybe
and was idea what the shape of the remote controls

design and me ask you to create a prototype or what a remote control i
and then it a triple a. or it on parental control more do
and here and the switch that control if you want
come out of that thing that make this the controller chip is that it is more do the so you one
you also have the two other might use for the prototype control

and in the markets the people are not really interested with the l. c. d. without l. c. d. b. it's speech recognition interface or that a speech resignation interface but also the
without l. c. d. and the door speech recognition you and then our
what about this the speech recognition
without l. c. d. with that speech recognition are we missing

just explain the button
this button is like the malls it's like a joystick you can move in train
actions and then you have a pig you know doubleclick or nursing a button i
so we have the second dash and also with the different a button configuration the so
and i think the for the points here to have an button to find it charges because
because they will be was a lot of control's a lot of buttons for kids
because maybe buttons you lose the silent
and then individual buttons to make them more

if you we have we have a four buttons for navigation press one
press one button acting as a enter button so

one beep and one without l. c. d. "'s" but
so now you have it l. c. d. and without l. c. d. sell
how do feel does that with the l. c. d. and without l. c. d.
so without l. c. d. how would you rate it
d. u. them in the days without l. c. d. that is not much you know it an s. so can
so without l. c. d. you want to put that at the same level of you know which are
and which would you recommend easier to use with the l. c. or without l. c. d.
table or a spongy that's without

so i take three on it the city so without
so without the city has to get five

adding the easy to use a space different for different people for
that but there are all what i'm trying to say here is that the we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people so

it's a final design
that's a lot and you know they show and in this design now we come
and also like do it and offencive designs maybe again
maybe again proved more the design i and easier to
we have you have designed to pour x. no one is that
as for the design maybe we should higher design a two
law there's a buy us a document because we designed
and the depends upon our design so
we can have the more complex design if you do a one in that

but also the people want that in touch it is a thing is they want to have and fancy look-and-feel it's true very fancy
one is fancy look so again
sell on the scale if it is true if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one or
me one or if it is false you do then it looks it doesn't look much fancy then you could just any seven so
look like is it a very fancy or doesn't look much fancy
so removing the l. c. d. gives us a bit more you'd have to you to have a fancy look
yes and to give a small ability to have a fancy look so

and it be additional functions associate that or the actions and then you have
powerful use that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons but
but here you only have few buttons but you week
buttons but you week and the same powerful function and it is but in addition
to use because there are few weeks and the buttons and
d. so that's why we have the power and audio

time we can finalise the product based on this
and for reach of the product you could just you made a scale according to this
argue i would think that know a product is has the best in law
you and then our product is going to be regularised
the problem is t. v. we are bright if a custom no one's a certain component and the one the parental control because it's a couple would not have and when you say the product
when you say the product of them i get you could make any kind of people and not
come up with new product i

i'm not the most likely that look the deadline it not
demands i think we would just have a tough look and then
itself since you haven't ship the remote who how do we need to choose interactively with the t. v. screen we just for buttons
one on the scale of the l. c. d. remote control car the look how does it look like is it a very
and to improve the look
can you need to look into the mitchell
i think the project manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making this one it's

and detective the big buttons for people
we also have that this module for old people we big buttons here you know the end of
for kids there wasn't a t. c. d. it's similar read for the old people there wasn't a c. d. so that's why

and and if you just push on it's consider like a rat enter function
so i'll sing to the led else in the right defines other functions so
idea because after maybe one or two months function use it's in the story you do
so there is bases function and
so the total cost if you want all the fiction functionalities will be about the fifteen that was
so you mean that even if this what it is p. b. function and that would be optional
it's so i think it's cheaper or if you if you already been to the on the functionalities on the same at your
