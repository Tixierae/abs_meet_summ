it's a television yes
yes but some all televisions you have to a click on a a special button then you go to a next level you can push two buttons
there's nothing i think it's
i think it's pretty basic the
right help you could
yes on the side that will be a strip of rubber and in the middle
and the lights
the all the aspects of the interface but as
because we're gonna use one colour for the plastic ago what colour for the rubber isn't it then we're gonna
and maybe some more brighter of flashy
we'll talk about lies later "'cause"
wanna have a car come on prides remote
so maybe a lot of people find it really are doing in other people find a really i don't know i don't
i think the fronts will give it a more less ugly or side because you can make it in your own yes you can make it in
then for the retrieval
maybe you can look it up right now
special go i think that
why is that so expensive
because it visible be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons i
because the buttons will be that will be matching colour between the buttons and a rubber surroundings i think that's

but it's flat it's flat as this so
and all the other buttons are available for your some
so it's it's really good design
lively other what would you say we gonna
i think two or three
are go for the part that sort of a two
i was thinking about three so i
a market remote controls
remote controls and it makes stepping easy
it's it depends on the maybe
but the light see it's kind of future
innovative in generally or just original four
but the retrieval or the
i think that's very innovative for a remote control
i received spreadsheets
different yes

remote control has got it really trendy look
though so i think maybe it has a score higher on this then on the
i was planning to give it a two i they're not ugly all
all that's true you agreement
let's leave it open for for there's you are because we have to reevaluate anyway it
here you can put that on the side it's really would like to
on the meetings it or something
we we indicate
and then cocoa i don't watch than
we don't need kinetic so and then i know it's
where do we find this information was it
i haven't got an idea or in which we need to use really

deem them must be innovative technology for remote controls one more in our you controls not in how you finder
but i definitely don't think it's a five but
remote controls easy to use
room where i know for a risk
i've just sell
when it sixties you can get a two
maybe three this time
till nine is that one or is that nine yes
and i count them like this
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen because this
i don't think the special form as it is true
special form also said

i think the most of the functions are all see as as a little
as a little bit power button
do you did we want to have them mute button
the one because it is first gives you the functionality of that's a separate button all set to apply
i think it worse that way really
and it's the same thing where have as a big remote
if it evaluation i dunno
yes we can make also in your lights on the top or the buttons they can make lights on it

i kinda
right i will be needing that
would the four of us are going to do that together wanna
more through like function t. v. functionalities send know
in a in comparing with people of data about
i think we we have special colours

i will be needing that image so we've had these
i would gonna evaluate that design according to a few points
no they didn't know about retriever or speaker unit
otherwise you get a stand that plastic or
i don't know it's very special
that's bit of a problem because

nee that's true that's true they're definitely need it sell
it when you compared to the
so encrypted to width
that when we a score higher on innovative technology which or two
we did a pretty job until now
one battery that i'll explain it's

just problem or programme of also
not nothing really trendy about it
maybe d. the logo
that's not innovative lights
you think the light side of a

but do we have to do we need extra buttons for example some
have i know some remote controls that down at these buttons but you still can know you can still select the twenty a number in the twenty or it's
no it's some television respond differently look
that are they also is also a re not innovative it's more
why not seven

need m. b. and a lot of remote controls work it when you for you push the one first then you have a couple seconds no i don't think so
yes you have televisions then you have to it you have to press
be done on the you don't understand my point i think it's except
but you get the inputs it comes
to the one that's the same thing as the button with the one entity yes it is

i think it's more it's them maybe we don't we both don't really understand how it all really works but
then it's a simple chip
the sample sensor sample speaker what is it is
the yellow rose the amount of
fifty cents for one single stupid button

and then we have to adjust the two buttons we place them in the middle the menu and for the teletext i thought that
no the mute button is now do you did we want
the mute button
but still you can retrieve it when it's ready to go on with the with

but you gotta make it clear
no that's not really yes it's simply
and in the middle there's hard to hard material have a hard plastic with a light behind it
we could get the numbers

a special button when you're talking about at this just a signal
i think the lights are gonna be problem so
no on the front
yes maybe we can use on the lights on the side we can use multiple lights so

i'm but i'm not that some televisions that we have the remote control supplied as you can do the buttons with a one and a dash into a dash but when you use but the remote control that doesn't support these buttons it still works but
and the button for the scart audio video external input
and was used to that was the mute button and it's will be eighteen
let's see that we have a button supplements we'll give the buttons

backwards it's leaning backwards i think in the docking station
we we'll see we'll stumble on some problems
first of all the all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list
we include one battery

remote control hasn't got too much redundant or i needed buttons
it's different for it
the store
it's this is first problem

maybe the on the sides
in the mean the rubber
you know what i wanna see if we deem them must
come on remote control hasn't got

what is it is that the speaker or words i don't know what it
when you have the same amount of button you have to put it in a carton board and
and less buttons then this isn't possible this is the most simple
and the throw it

i had a code teens and twenties
so yes you have a lot of standard buttons and have to be a with a
entity yes it is think about it

the two numbers
a with a one and a double
you can when you put a button on it would like one and then a dash it's the same thing as when you just push the one because

differently look if it is just
i think it's except the same thing we
yes but some television don't support it

signal get in when we when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds then the remote control gives a signal for channel one
that's a one you agree
we've tried to make it the best training after

at this just a signal to see that then they send it signal to the t. v. today have to put a one in a screen and a dash which you can put it so you can are still put another number on that when you
it comes to the one that's the same
fine yes because

it still works but we'll input
will discuss them in usability lab
you're not on tape

just have to be big enough for the biggest
shouldn't it fold and it isn't going to fall down that's
you could make it like a hole in it you know of it in the

later "'cause" i also the it's depends
that design and these forget the drawing skills these guys i
i remote controls not be how do you feel

it's depends on the costs and such but
we've got the though that on the right in the most right most screen because
we indicate amount of components of truth specific point how much we need of them and then

prides remote or it's not hardly a bit weird
i copied that one
fill in the number of components you guys using the five minute of the cost i

make a phone
how do you know i mean you got that email with that one out what to use them for
that's no option let's no option

because of slogan in the remote
a simple chip busy enough i think but with
what's special

we're gonna have a prototype presentation first
was gonna give a prototype presentation you

'kay we've made a prototype
we've drawn here the prototype the

a special we looked at the form material and colour
then add a discourse now to c. r. to laugh it's four five

the all functions i discussed i think the most
so open know

bit power button
because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative but it put it

i am i'll tell most
but you can make a remote control without them because

see i do we have a little beyond that and a little
to ask they're different ways for remote controls to to do like

for example some some of the
that it's dependent on the television

applied and then for now
i'm in the same colour of the side

i do think that t. v. support more multiple kind of remote controls
double work with a to have that

no you have to it you have to give the television at two or more signals when you up
to have that special button

and the older televisions needs more signals to go level higher
when you make the technology that it will give more signals it could work but

i kinda miss the docking station
i would say one because every button is relevance and

itself i don't want that one button that's about
it's two point six

that one function and that's in the one button when you wanna find it
put a when that when it all the lowest part of it so when it's the same as the other products you can put it all on the same

because real reaction cells more projects than only remote controls so maybe we can
so maybe we can use a docking station for example and pretty players or

if you've got a database like this i want role
again first of

as this so we can make all the product as this
but the icsi that much

because maybe we have to consider the docking station anyway because we have some cost issues still to come we have to look at the
remote control because you always will pick up the remote control in the smallest area then you're

but maybe i don't know if that's important i will
know if that's important i will talk about that later for now this

to to see the agenda
evaluation criteria

because the last most
no there's no comparison

but we do we didn't or we're not data you fronts a bit of a
no not a different line width of colours maybe

remote control in remote controls relevant buttons are prominently feasible
i think we're gonna fill out not a question of

remote control hasn't got too much redundant or i needed buttons i think
buttons i think we probably succeeded

maybe a two because of the menu button or something but in that area
and you know menu maybe

lights that
are six or seven

one to seven
it's true i agree but

yes the docking station is it is a little bit of a it's
the docking station in it

no on the agenda says evaluate now so i think we
i don't know what special go

as a one or two at least
i've found twelve questions so much but it's still a stand

no just if they buy it
right the room

right it's in general
are thing to i agree too

and i don't mean to keep it is
we need one battery

we don't have to slogan
don't watch than we are done don't know if it's

three
to use as total

three i agree
four five seven nine that fifteen seventeen twenty one twenty four twenty six

this was the evaluation
as a separate buttons yes

we have see the simple "'s" buttons
now it's only when you use push buttons it will cost that much if you use

no one till nine is
control but what it is in four

give our own if it's a protection too because else we would
really have a probably would be impossible to make it

they can and all that the remote control but what
that teletext would also be in a possible

plastic plastic
'kay but the problem now is that the there's no such thing as a docking station in this but we can

welcome to the details design meeting

again i'm gonna take minutes

two hours go ahead

you've got are aspect from the last meeting

the logo is it's it's pretty all the used to see on the remote control what

is necessary when you want to build your company for it to a level higher

are interface elements are shown in the drawing maybe you can appoint

maybe you can appoint "'em" the functions

then the nine channels

the foley own it's site and the other side is the programs and

but it's here then in the middle

alright and you got a point out which is the volume and button and which is the programme button

tell most of them are right and that's

most of the users

are i don't have time i any more or less

and and a triangle on that

yes next so that i kinda miss a zero actually

whereas was one thing i wanted to ask

there's no that's and the dependent on the television

across or whatever yellow line

but you don't actually need m. b.

is it depending on television

yes but remote control nowadays are they come with the television or actually the

or actually the other way around

some televisions don't accept that's

because it's it is for the television it's exact same thing

and this and when you push the button the remote control gives a single it

a single it in the first place this is signal which it would also sent we put a separate button on it the one with there's that

no it works if you haven't got special button for a if you push a button then all your television there will be one and align it which is it and displaced

but a six and then that would appear when you put a separate button for separate button

now but then they want would also support that button because it's the same thing this is what that's

on that when you don't have a separate button any push you want it's exactly the same thing that you to

thing that you to the remote control gives it same signal as it would give when you only have

there was some televisions need to be input first n. you

now our remote can

yes so they need i know they need

yes it's simply not it's simply not true

you know you can we you push the one you can show on the telly it a one and just that there's no way it's it's it's a cat or something

have as a big remote control gives another signal of the five seconds it is just one

no remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds remote

five seconds remote control is a stupid thing if

thing if you push a button it sends it immediately to the television

i dunno i dunno if it's necessary

up to supply the next to the zero to one or two i think so

you can access that if i it's a round of my notes i

what i said

what i said about to the remote control sending another signal that they might not be true but i still

not be true but i still think it all t. v.s in some way support it i don't know

support it i don't know i think

all really works but i think there's more to it and what are we just had

remote control sends one signal at the one button press

some televisions when you want to go further then ten

when you up whereas one button you give one signal and the older televisions

just the basic idea of all of the most most common a simple operations on the remote

we came

pretty basic the itself i don't want

but maybe we can make docking station a bit standard for the other products we sell because real

a hearing devices

i think that's very difficult because different shapes of devices

yes but when you put the same full-time she's on that you can put a when

it can it has gotta fit into the shape of course

the technology and the fold which can be the same that's the that's true but

true but it if you will make them having a bottom like this then they all set

no we can make it make the most that was part all the same

when the the recharger as a bit but points out we can place all on top of it

no way you make it large enough and it will not but then it's a little bit

if like this all pointed out if you've got

but it's just an idea

this i want role but if you got a base

but if you got a base which is as they get this

but if you got a tiny play i can

but it's backwards it's leaning

what you could do a few it from the bottom right

yes a little lower little a little products go deeper in it

that is that it's possible

that's at let's talk about the docking station later because maybe

we have to look at the i don't know

that's the look-and-feel would be great on this remote control because

i don't walk across

then you're left of you're right that it's the near the program button

which is the most common use the function and

and the lights

maybe d. the logo

but it will also use batteries and

for now this is is good enough

but an l. a. the colour because we're

isn't it then we're gonna do the buttons and are we gonna have rubber buttons in there

in there be a old in the same colour as the rubber on the side

i think that'd be great

i think we should use darker colour for the basic and maybe some

but and we have to agree or upon the x. course but maybe i don't

the next day you're gonna give a presentation

you're gonna give a presentation to to

a bit weird sentence but

the positive things has to be on the left so i said not oddly instead of lively other

say we gonna give points to to all of these to evaluate that design and

i think it for maybe would be appropriate "'cause"

maybe it really depends on days and i mean it's

days and i mean it's kind of dairy our designs

how do you guys feel

the different designs yes

more to your own personality or how style

no not fronts but different designs

a colour colours

and that's still what is this is a little personal touch i what

maybe we should do it three or something to win are

what would you that's i think personally

i was thinking of force i think three is

three is a bit

what am i doing a market

i'd like you agree

our group

and usability zero

i agree remote control

i it's something really good work

it's all about the buttons

also the buttons of the wanted to the digits or

we don't know to you and dennis

or they're used the other

no i do that and you've got a point

true i agree

yes three two

came a long way but not we didn't not

or we can also always be more simplistic what was

it's hard to say from a speech

i will make it a three because

it a three because i

but i do think it is more trendy than beautiful

i agree

great remote control

no way remote control

remote control has got innovative technology implanted

we're in the mean the rubber

but we have to talk about the light so that are they also is

and the light maybe

six or seven actually that's

no i think actually it's a seven maybe with there's nothing innovative about is

you didn't draw the docking station

i mean i don't say smooth but i think the

but i think the docking station is you can only got a kind of a problem

it's a part of the remote and

and the speaker on the there's also a speaker

for now it's a six or seven the six maybe

it's a six

for the retrieval function

i would you innovative remote control more

put it on your ad

that's think about it later they don't have that

a risk at one

you like the buttons

the moment rome reborn right

it will be bought by people under the age of forty

yes too but only ink when you compare it with the elderly

and that's the question is usable it will be bought by people of forty

this is just guessing

the remote control as recognisable corporate image call our logo or slogan

phone is quite obvious

the slogan "'cause" it's

other no the slogan here you can put that on

now i still think it's gonna be at two or three maybe three

in the remote controls got a basic design intended for novas users

this was my evaluation is all

because i still think that the most important part of these meetings to us

is this something after this meeting

a five

but i actually don't need this presentation i that

i'm gonna open the specially them all gonna work this out together because

probably a four at all and it here

but that's that's are we need we include

it the components are listed over here the price is given

the price is given we

we are done don't know if it's still improperly we need one

battery one battery i think the reason we don't need kinetic

we should know how many simple chips regular chips

is one chip but which you have to choose one form it

think but with the lights in the retrieval it can be

i think it was your job in the first me to afford to do your first presentation to make this clear but then you have some time problems but do you think

the email i got said simple chip but when we put in the speaker and the retriever a device it will costa a bit more like a high in the advanced chip maybe

when we don't we leave the retrieve in such a side what that then

that then we'll be simple chip and

we'll be simple chip and with the retriever it would be an advanced chip

right one out the advanced chip for now i

that would be enough for future recommendations

but it will it will we call a lot of problems the sample sensor

words i don't know what it is

we went for the double curved case

and out of plastic and rubber and with a special colour

special colour

then of course but i was just counting them i

them i think you have to indicate the amount of pushbuttons we want to use isn't

a problem because of it but every don't understand that because i can imagine a remote control will for more pushbuttons there wouldn't be possible according to do is sheet

i don't think so because it says amount the yellow

if you use a scroll-wheel

maybe it's the kind of push buttons you can have

buttons you can have four kind of twelve buttons

is all as one twelve

twelve then a bit eighteen "'cause" i rated there was

use as total four buttons

one two three four

i don't understand it that i don't

that i don't get one because it would be so relatively so expensive just these small buttons

is that sense the fifty cents a button

so when you said and it

it's eighty percent of the price of of the amount of

i can i couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents for upper bound really

is the most simple it's possible

it's possible what

what i've never seen one before

i've seen one one remote control with only that but only with a pager place down and volume but

without the numbers that's possible

that's still four

i see it's still four little children they can and

but then still when we there's no room for a docking station or something that

we'll give the buttons special colour or give them a special

or give them a special form i think we should

form i think we should mark special form thing because it visible

special corps where it is

i think that's that what they mean by special colour i think all

otherwise it would be that

i think all the special colour things have to be marked v. because that's what we were planning to do making it

special material also because of rubber

because of rubber buttons have to be rubber

what is the normal material

in this but we can all imagine that would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents

but we can it sell the remote control and sell the docking station yes

and but we don't have to tell it but what we

it but what we can say of can almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station
