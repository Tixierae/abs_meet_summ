you control on the board using this pen but there
the way how it should be controlled by user which
start with you on how do you think the remote should function for the user
would it be for user to have display on this remote control on which you can see functions

before we think about remote control we will work with some of the tools we have here
project the remote control
i think mode and remote control shoots up control a device that is a subset of equipment for insist
so one re one remote control for all your equipment
yes so one thing one remote control should control one or more at ease of equipment and the way of
that's just the fun the technical function is what should the remote control do what is
i i've seen these remote controls with this little stick which you can move forward sight words know these things

it's a remote control the television
the television remote control
in this case control that the television i think

we're here to develop a new product
this new product
this new product we are going to develop
the profits we are looking for this product is fifty million euros
we we will focus is internationally so the product
and which might be interesting to implement in a product

and i'm we can find more goals for the product we're going to develop
so we should keep that in mind but what way during the development
we're not developing this product for a specific centre are you know we
just developing this product then we want so that to a very brought up public so
or what we should take it in account when developing such product
because we what we want to develop a trendy product so

then the discussion maybe the time for sebastian
maybe the time for sebastian to show his presentation

maybe during the discussion section
all of these stages mean that we do some individual work prepare and then and need to discuss are the for the ring in the
folder if you want to discuss it with us
which i may be to take with you and upcoming a discussion one thing about
and i think now it's time is to have a little discussion about what's the product should be and how we should look but
so the main port and the main points you are timing is our focus on the inter a probability and
i do think it's time not to discuss a some things
terms of i'm afraid we do not have any more time

the functional design the conceptual design and the detailed design
the other design stage is we will discuss that later so welcome
so welcome keep it with the functional design

what i fact should be remotes have in this case
i think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy it just knowing store it's
it's not for for philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product right

the second is the technical functional design
how exactly does it work in the technical sense
things and the technical possibilities in possibilities so if
so if someone of you comes up with i. d.s i'll try to translate them and technical functions but the might be some
and that also will remind people of some new texaco possibilities which are available and which
it's not really hearts the technical anymore but you should
things sebastian told us a few things about be technical implement implications
that's just the basic technical function so that was
so technically it will be possible

is there are the schedule for this meeting
i will do is the agenda for today for this meeting
and this is the first meeting to generate some some ideas about it
all fiddle and use it in in the meetings
in the meetings only in the meetings it really like a like
i just want to do it so input for this meeting do

at all is here as we user interface designer and sebastian
by user which is little or it doing this part
of our user interface
our user interface i had it's more industrial think a point
so it should be as user interface for feeling should be good to understand you
those are two really user interface

used if you should equipped infrared and bluetooth together in one remote

marketing expert
the weighting is for our marketing expert rude
role but it is here as the marketing expert at all is
we will discuss later on more ideas about how the remote should look and how was it should function and all those kind of things the market
the market we should have a look at the market
so the product a will be sold if there is market interest in more than one country and
do you have anything already we add idea about how the market will respond to that such product or what we should take

is there any room for a little presentation maybe during
you can displayed at two presentations as you want to
and for example back and you can they can
so you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to any questions
yes i have some technical issues which i would like to present do you before we start discussion because
i'll go back to my own presentation
