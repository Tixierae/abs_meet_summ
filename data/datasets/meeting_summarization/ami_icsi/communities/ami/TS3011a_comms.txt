and i'll stand by close the
you are here in a specific role
role but it is here as the marketing expert at all is
is that correct
we're going to do a little tool training for the tools we are going to use a during the meetings we are going to have here
then i will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project and and
the other design stage is we will discuss that later so welcome
so welcome keep it with the functional design
current colour you can choose not a colour and
and for example back and you can they can
so was dennis thinking about the animal
and i at all so we'll propose some some of them patience for that's
and that also will remind people of some new texaco possibilities which are available and which
i do think it's time not to discuss a some things
things sebastian told us a few things about be technical implement implications
just developing this product then we want so that to a very brought up public so

i'm you've got an email from a row account manager about it
and this is the first meeting to generate some some ideas about it
the second is the technical functional design
sensors so they're not grab it here with the led more
it's on the reissa now so we take
so we can work together on its we're all fiddle
all fiddle and use it in in the meetings
to i'll i'm red and
i'm red and the documents it should be in the project documents folder if you want
folder if you want to discuss it with us
it look more than a bunny than cats but i it works right
we we will focus
we we will focus is internationally so the product
because those are important numbers
then the discussion maybe the time for sebastian
switch we as to switch

at all is here as we user interface designer and sebastian
and sebastian is here in the role of industrial designer is that correct
those are kind of easy goals and
we will discuss later on more ideas about how the remote should look and how was it should function and all those kind of things the market
which consists of three different design stages
it really like a regular a regular whiteboard
i'm guessing a morse
not very good in drawing
and the production cost should not be more than at twelve euro fifty so
first about my role of the industrial designer i
which i may be to take with you and upcoming a discussion one thing about
i think mode and remote control shoots up control a device that is a subset of equipment for insist
so i think it's a universal

i will do is the agenda for today for this meeting
because that might be some installations
installations influence
one thing about interloper at a probability
we should discuss that and
but all t. v.s are equipped with infra-red so
but it's cost effective
but take these things into account when you start the discussion
and the way of communicating with this equipment

it's important that the laptops are other exactly on the square forty cameras
so that's just my role i'll just
i had a few things in mind
they're very far of a normal
channels or change between tracks on the c. d. or chapters
our user interface i had it's more industrial think a point

we're here to develop a new product
so now i have a different line width and the colour quite
the remote control we are going to develop will have a selling price of about twenty five euros the profits
not all model so that's the point
most of them are used
it just should change the t. v.s state so

maybe during the discussion section
this new product we are going to develop
the television remote control
and i'm we can find more goals for the product we're going to develop
the market we should have a look at the market
we are going to use a private project method cheering at this development which consists

great it's important
it's also possible to use this one as you can
i'll show that now
in the meetings only in the meetings it really like a like
to switch the between channels or

you control on the board using this pen but there
but there are a little sensors so
so we take the pen button
so not too fast writing
you can insert in new slide or whiteboards file by a i they're using the instance function or by taking the next button or the blank button it's quite the same

all are and what smart board notes should be kept in the same file so do not
so do not make a new file just
you can use your race or two make something get away
but we all used to say whiteboard file

for a cellphone
role i'll just i give you a everybody some test call input and
and i think now it's time is to have a little discussion about what's the product should be and how we should look but
so the main port and the main points you are timing is our focus on the inter a probability and

good morning
you today i was a base a trip
is there are the schedule for this meeting

actually i didn't go out and feel like it's
and feel like it's have do
i'll go back to my own presentation

projects kick off
it's a remote control the television
yes i have some technical issues which i would like to present do you before we start discussion because

and you can they can choose the line width
did you do you agree
or chapters or no d. player so maybe

project the remote control
so it should fit to every device
so that was my really my part for this session

are used if you should
but that's something we should discuss and
the telephone technical function white what you said is just there pressing the button you should change state of the t. v. that's just

yes so one thing one remote control should control one or more at ease of equipment and the way of
that was your presentation
don't have the information for

the way how it should be controlled by user which
by user which is little or it doing this part
sense that remote it should work on different t. v.s or even different

marketing expert
do you want to open it as read only

you should could be laptop or right into the square for
for the cameras yes good morning so i'll say

good morning miss the p. m. you today
i'm fine

good morning reid
three

as you see now i can give a presentation
which is on your desktop at least it should be

you can displayed at two presentations as you want to
to present eight to show us a file you need to that place it in your project documents folder which

at least it should be
then we have decided to make a white board system

i'm just i'm guessing what should be my favourite animal
start with you on how do you think the remote should function for the user

it should be kept
is it feed that that animal

any questions or just let me know
back to our project

and which might be interesting to implement in a product
for insist d. v. d. player cell phones video and audio equipment so one

we're not living in the in nineteen eighties anymore so infra-red is not
it's not really hearts the technical anymore but you should

good morning for this

you ready you should could be

good morning so i'll say

i was a base a trip to boston

you have the same as itself so windows can that

close the window

the weighting is for our marketing expert rude

it's important

and we will have a discussion

this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes so

minutes so we should keep that in mind

is there any room for a little presentation maybe during

this new product

and first of all it should be original it should be trendy and user-friendly those are

the functional design the conceptual design and the detailed design

all of these stages mean that we do some individual work prepare and then and need to discuss are the for the ring in the

in the the progression is yes

regression

the first stage the functional design we are going to search for the user requirements and we will

and we will make a specific as justification of that

what i fact should be remotes have in this case

in this case control that the television i think

and the last one is the working design how exactly

how exactly does it work in the technical sense

before we think about remote control we will work with some of the tools we have here

it here with the led more a little bit more to d. a. t. and

a new file just use this one during the day

you can choose the formats

i it's maybe because i'm not so buttons for that

easy if you do have any questions just ask me to

as a little training i will ask you to do it first to draw a your own animal on the new slide with at a different colour a different line width then the one and that's like that

an animal

it's a bunny

and all that you do the same place but it different animal

but it different animal with the different colour and a different line width

with a very small

beautiful

so you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to any questions

the profits we are looking for this product is fifty million euros

which is quite a number of

so the product a will be sold if there is market interest in more than one country and

so we should keep that in mind but what way during the development

maybe the time for sebastian to show his presentation

i would like to think about the implementation of of things and

things and the technical possibilities in possibilities so if

so if someone of you comes up with i. d.s i'll try to translate them and technical functions but the might be some

but the might be some in possibilities so that's one

i have some initial ideas about some things

so one re one remote control for all your equipment

there should be some intro put that in probability between them

i think it can come in handy we should

and we should think about the way how these things i should come you get with each other we're not living

but you should it think about things like a bluetooth

but the infra-red it's but old-fashioned if you would call that but all t. v.s

so that's the point so

used if you should equipped infrared and bluetooth together in one remote

and about every everybody should think about it so that's just my

there are other things like how to make it trendy which is

which is i think most the roots role

so let's start with you on how

that and rubber ability just like some sense that

these devices

i think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy it just knowing store it's

it's not for for philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product right

so we're going this is the consumer not

that it's not i have don't have the information

we're not developing this product for a specific centre are you know we

that's just the basic technical function so that was

so is that ease of use or is it more like a

that's just the fun the technical function is what should the remote control do what is

do what is this task but it has and as an device it just should

state so that's it's

you see the buttons as a means of doing this or are there any or

with buttons

or are there any or all the controls i don't

or maybe you wanna touch screen or

i don't know anyone think

i i've seen these remote controls with this little stick which you can move forward sight words know these things

and it's very easy for user to switch we as

of our user interface
