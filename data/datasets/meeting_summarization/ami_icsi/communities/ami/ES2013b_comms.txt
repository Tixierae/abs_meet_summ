it fell off
you know we're ready
welcome to
welcome to this second meeting
meeting it's not core after twelve and we're
this is a meeting on functional design
and in thinking about the forty minutes i thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes
because just i had to do with intel there was some new project requirements and we have
everybody agree with us
or they complete to be
complete to be discussed everything that we covered last time
technical functions design
then we have to be the user interface
just maybe a little bit more inspired
you'd ever need a battery is really
but it also has a place so
still i don't know if it's quite within our price range
with a euro time and another component like another piece or
but i think you're a single questions about
more money than sense of them or otherwise something new to it
i asked to put more money than brains
but what i was gonna say was although they may maybe buying you know personal music devices and all that only necessarily
i think we've got big hill to climb and

as a group i think we've are they accepting the minutes
that looks good
and to think about menu functionality in current technology and
and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools
percent i think of all these numbers most important is fifty percent of users
and eighty percent of users and if we think
and any you know existing examples and what
where as years point it's attempting to manage to use a super entertainment system with something that looks like a small tray you know it's
he's in the role age group you must you wanna this
you must you wanna this small population
but i think the key is to get be really adopters people were from new technology and
not we're not looking at whether there early adopters on that screen that's looking at
f. and f. eight
and what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions pretty much the same as for existing remotes have if we can build on this with the speech recognition that's not something
do we have some idea of how much it would cost to create a device has to be used basic elements because man
no but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably array mike cost more it's it at first to develop and to install but for

and we have to make some on decision on what functions that will have
the product should just adopt and we've huge and we talked about
no no you possibly even materials like the type of plastic used but everything including size and shape of buttons positioning of buttons actual shape of a handheld device colours just every at everything to do with this has to be evolution i used to
i would've liked to do you a pretty powerpoint slide all of my first cut design but i'm fortunate
or what if the chip for whatever reason breaks down after certain amount of time to you just replace it to
could it be possible to have a you know that a rechargeable internal battery like like in m. p. three player does or you could just or a mobile phone or whatever you
and then as you charged for ages of ages and you don't have to worry
and you don't have to worry with replacing a buttons question
definitely "'cause" i'm thinking in terms of the los and breakage of remotes how much that is
how much that is to do with it not really having a home and that's it's a place to live exactly
still have this little topic
and the dark could look very fancy and
and that could be your inspiration of having a look and decent

more research on how much more would be and
and what reactions to them have been and it's a sort of like
no you take your exactly right there but i think
you had the other power channel
which is really not very efficient at all
it's not start and the back of the so far but then
but then again i'd i don't know if this is within our price range or not
and i don't know much about what these things cost only some
only some research for the next meeting
solar may not be so good when you're watching t. v. in the night it's the
just so annoying a
it would have to sort store the energy
we may be talking quite heavy then

one of the biggest issues i thought about from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these remote controls and
and i think that this is an opportunity to really take real reaction in the direction of similar of hand-held schools and then use and are used by many of us and that kind of bring the remote control into the site same round as an accessible useful a product device as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you so
so my main goal here
my main goal here is to the envision the remote control in this context and
no in between as the project manager they sent me an email from the powers that be
that teletext is l. d. cage and the internet
but they want this remote control that only be for t. v. with
with incorporating the corporate image colour and slogan
and again bring the real reaction printing in and get
and get some positive marketing for other tools even if we directly don't advertise for t. i. go of require line so
on that but i think be competition it's a scene out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very important because

on any some implications the four million sales targets and new ideas of not too many buttons bright colours and some of the influence of the japanese and we closed early
and we closed early so you can then
you may have any questions one those minutes or they
we talked about be the individual roles so we chat as
was present but yes we did and we
but if we're aiming to build this thing for twelve euros fifty it's a little
it yes and i'm making the we that's people who are familiar younger people are more familiar with technology than older people or comfortable you know
been doing a little bit of bread priest research and if i had a
me say if you'll bear with me i'll do it on the whiteboard
so you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop

i'm afraid i incorporate
it can else but these kids come from the
on it was market research an hour
these market research questionnaires looked into it you're a real concern about technology and
and specifically wanted to find out information that speech recognition
so this is the methodology i used in preparing for this meeting
i've been doing a little bit of bread
and we use the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve euros fifty a an energy source the user interface and
typically would be a battery but how open to suggestions
on the main components and that hardly the chip that actually has intelligence

you mention because that before our inside our budget and what we want this to do
but we could go back to the pictures of the "'cause" the pictures of the remote controls
that's true would take us to say
maybe afterwards we could do a white board with that you're the one on the right as a sense
control is it is for sending a message typically by infrared and
you could you know you just plug in to power source a couple of hours and then as you charged
people out there or are they making purchasing decisions you know
good point
would be are more efficient way of doing it

and one welcome you all and thank you all for
each of you have no that's seven minutes or maybe little more maybe the last three euro per presentations and a little discussion because
kate staffs there and myself in our full capacity for presents i opened
i think so we talked about
like that industrial designer should like that but if we're aiming
it has fast forward stop play all relating to movies and also has
i brought up some exactly
questions about are there enough of these people out there or

i taped to the minutes from the first meeting in a shot them to
screen and in that wasn't responded to put
of what i had so they can and to my head is you know they always t. a. batteries which
all make a note of that good
good good common
and all that only necessarily by t. v. remote controls because
because they probably are in the household has a t. v. if the these are end of each range and

who wants to go for speech
and the means we do need to make some decisions about what keys or buttons on the remote control to perhaps keep them and what ones to discard and
and if we devote some energy into this i think the recent productions of real reaction me i go everywhere power and the high definition t. v. d. players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these i think we can also use
i think we can also use this as a platform to make a contract with other tools and
and the internet is coming in is important but they want this
the early adopters those of us who grew up with technology and a lot looking for us have the cash to pay for the young
and i'm wondering how how our target price compares with three the typical price of these things like that industrial

i opened the meeting the product
definitely needs at a lot more research on
one here but i've been thinking of this device is being that she mass-produced device we're trying to sell four
we're trying to sell four million of "'em"
no the chip composer marketing or know the

in a shot them to you in a moment
i know each if you have a presentation and
i hadn't thought of it as being a terrible thing you just if it goes
that's another element which

fifty percent i think of
and to be extraordinarily reduction last power channel volume and everything else is up to the designers
and this is also supported by the market research
we only we've got to persuade people you've got a remote control "'cause" you came with the telly that they should buy our product instead

is fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons and
element which is if every time it and using the remote you put it on a charger then you then it has a place
or do we make that it goes to the through the manufacturer we sell
we sell to the manufacturer as remote it goes with it

and as approachable and
interesting i think that maybe shows more about been open to technology
that's looking at age groups
does it have to have be of being segregated from the others in a different frequency or something

and f. eight at the top
press them
and then we'll be patient
but for a long time you still be so much more convenient and economic and fiddling around trying to replaced chunky a. batteries and not having any indication drawer and

and icsi the requirements they're expecting of this
so we exceed the requirements
that plea the net result is that i've come up with a first cut for the working design that to discuss
that to discuss with you

let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is it
say we want an energy source
still have this little topic that you can fit to
because i agree that the people with so how can i put it more money than sense of

we did and we did a little bit of fighting building of making the pictures but i didn't think those
data style of thesis pear i
i really think we need to be

market research an hour a hundred people in the room so
i don't know if speech recognition should be should be included but i think it's an
but i think it's an interesting i think that

it's a large enough target market to market it
and i presume we can mess and functions related to the video or d. v. d. remote control if this is only gonna be a your satellite cable t. v. remote control so
buttons i'm saying in something some this move sleek little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and a menu that you can access

you know so it turns into something perhaps you all have
perhaps you all have seen the osbournes where
which will in incorporate an integrated circuit that actually

thinking that's my contribution
that's my contribution
alright and we'll turn

next to the control button on the bottom and f. eight
you just if it goes wrong you check account and that's
and that's what i'm a bit concerned i like the idea speech

be a wanna see it was on my slide typically
but also it has to be easy enough to it changed or we pay or if something goes for all for example the battery energy source or
it's not your job

which a man transfer us to some sending mechanism which
which includes it
and sends a message to the receiver so those are the basic

on what is it feel like that's where the user
that's where the user interface is really coming into it so the technical
the technical and is what's actually gonna be in there but also it has

and thank you all for doing some research in between
be good to know do you know who's actually buying televisions and are

we need to move this who wants to go for
we begin with that

as for as it goes
it in just stick it in

again most users really dislike the current look-and-feel of remote controls
and are we in the region where people have one television know

but ninety one percent fifteen to twenty five
but how open to suggestions

and with the technologies improve in if we can get these
in real numbers that's the ninety one percent of the seventy six percent translate to it in excess of the four million

no you take
exactly it yes and i'm making

if you want again it's like trying right
you can just do you draw in order

i think first off i do agree with what is sarah has defined as a your personal preferences i think we need up a more streamlined volume where you know extraneous functions
my method was to look at the existing remotes and all functions they have and

and also has seems to have channel up and channel dying which
'cause it the requirements really i just want to be able to change channels or functions which

which is more what you'd expect from a you know like a sky or cable remote control where you've got hundreds
control where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a nearly terrestrial one

minute do think we need them at all
or she in translates button presses into a message which a man

and i think and enter function where you can access it's not like teletext but a long the same lines access things on the screen
not related to the internet one that you mention because that

and possibly discuss what we think about them but which
but which is here what he has to say first

we turn that into a message
so those are the basic things that we've got to get

that's that's almost one in every tenth house or whatever it is
solar can do that

i'm i'm hoping that my personal coach i think so but if you're asking me but
i don't believe i know

and we're given forty minutes for this meeting this is a meeting

this is not everybody agree with us

and after the meeting that be the things to be done and she

and she as you can see it says we get to get one should and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions

for the minutes of the first meeting

as you can see it was this earlier today

and we talked about the financial and effect on any some implications

so you can then proceed with your research and getting reports together for to this meeting

i'm afraid i incorporate that one i said was present but

i accept a minute

but i didn't think those are appropriate to the minutes necessarily so

then we'll move to the three presentations

not really that touch those like the phones it

she said we didn't need to screw it in

some of the research in a in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now and

and in fact i think the high definition t. v. d. players in all this will come along in the will only benefit from the positive feedback from are design tool so

and if we think about this there are a lot of television t. v. d. c. a real remote control users out there a percent

out there a percent would spend more money on a remote control it looks fancy

these kids come from the smoke research we've

in the room so he the end of a hundred said they would spend more money

i think we can and i think we can really focus on this remote and again

in to see now elements was the which pay more for speech recognition questions so

pay for the young age group without the mortgages responsibilities ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control very interesting

i you we've this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this if you and you know the designers but ninety one percent

i think especially in terms of growth i think this would be a very smart grip to target the means three

target the means three quarters of the next age group twenty five to thirty five are interested and

or eight million

but would you pay more and

more and does it work and as approachable

and that's a very good question i don't know

mean i did not receive any information on that but i think

because there was a question about to want an l. c. d. screen and in

to put some of a larger remotes do you have screens for you can navigate you know so it turns into

i think they most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and

and we'll turn to the next presentation

i think she said we don't need to screw it in just

and then press what f.

there we are yay

the left a bit like that

i think first off

but it's also something we can discuss

these are two models of existing remote controls

the one on the left it seems to be a fairly standard universal remote control it has fast

but i think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right which has

which has also a play stop and pause a minute do think we need

i think we just needs channel selection volume up volume down and

we exceed the requirements "'cause" it the requirements

which is more a text on the screen i think the natural buttons i'm

but that i do think we need to discuss this p. h. recognition possibility

i think the white the one on the right as as less cluttered

definitely less cluttered and

less cluttered and i mean there's still

i'll just use something else i was gonna say data style

the ergonomics of it fits in

so that's an hour

and if i had a design team i would've been discussing my ideas with all that plea the

that actually composes the message based on what we which buttons user presses we turn that into

and then we need sending mechanism to send it to the receiver now i

now i would have helped i think

would have helped i think that's why any slide actually i would've liked

design but i'm fortunate technology defeated me say if you'll

chip that actually has intelligence or she in

things that we've got to get in for our twelve euros fifty thank you

but those things it's all speaking get those components

the block that rectangle for the user interface is where the user comes in of what does it look

of what does it look like what are the buttons

like what are the buttons look like on

because it may be a saying area with several other user interfaces like for d. v. d.s movies whatever

i like the idea speech recognition that's a great idea but i'm not

idea but i'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price what we need to do need to hit

because man

or know the chip composer centre

what they cost

i because then we would have to figure out how much we had a way in terms of user interface and this look-and-feel idea

it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and speech use the which is

speech use the which is pretty much the same as this existing models just maybe

that's really good idea

i i think that's very interesting idea but

idea but i'm not very good industrial designer and i don't know much about

it's better than idea that's all we're probably

and then use it solar can do

we and i would be too heavy and cost

heavy and cost too much

so if you can dark at you know you could it's argue that cases

are we as to what our target group is the old

much that we've been looking for the younger and

i was wondering that because i agree

that's probably more buttons
