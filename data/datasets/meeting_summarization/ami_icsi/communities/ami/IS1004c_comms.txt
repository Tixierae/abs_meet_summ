think it's what they found in
because they are more all parental newly like new devices and
and also be a according to a marketing people or nineteen ninety five percent of young people are worse
was able to
is not just buying an eel control the remote you do need my income for a remote buying
kind of thing that i you could use it as as a way to implement
you if you said that the t. v. at the fancy thing that's true you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that we not have any
but that can we use it for so ten or fifteen territory
so it's crazy i like user
is just to feed
it might be useful to have some kind of base station even if it's
they should be some flexibility
but then i like a banana you can you hold it like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and it's
roll back and forth like that but with
so this functionality could be used for pressing the mobile phone which has been misplaced
so is that when you say it's because of what you mean it just has an apple print which kind of
then we the old one in control a thing which a user should it should be already p. define it should
it should be in one would be the case the chip a lot is going to be sitting inside
these things we can go to the next slide
than that user wants to help control more than one device want to control more than one device from the same remote control still
it's objects
you have only one that had a fruit know but
i think it's a pretty handy feature

if i come back to the minutes of the last meetings
what you mean close
not yet not yet
of a fruit or you want to some kind of like fruit logo on
to buy and need a corner remote control
on the product is something for to school
for instance for
not it's what they are they said
so i received an email i'll and lunchtime they know that the bring in mind to the technology division has developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit
it's just a speaker like
going chip and less used
at this time of course more couple of some of the features of that potential funky looking remote control
it doesn't look like a banana apple
but i think it's important you know to have two scroll-wheels because you know you want one for the channel we also want one for the volume because
one for the volume because it's the volume is it's you know it's very handy for it to have the instant kind of feedback and response
scroll so you know the person might want to have a
is one is that you should batteries which that they could be chargeable
then controls for the traditionals
but this one's like when you say double curve
so it could be co of so it could be convex can be concave depending on what people want
i mean you could also it you can't just a very thin veneer of wood as
depends if we if we are concentrating on like a fruit design the number eight maybe we wanna so what collection of fruit but a different fruit for each device "'cause" out you know that

for instance i think out
like maybe just like a little bit and a little fruit peaches somewhere in the corner but i don't know about
it's not a microphone
actually i'm not reading microphone that so
now we can can choose that
we can we kind
it's not a lot one of the templates so i
i have i think it's probably more than that you can handle "'cause" is designed for a coffee machine you notice a hell are in the morning
i don't know the name like in english
this is not a three
dream yes i see
i do a set it that's a switch with the double your four is you have
i dunno it seems a little bit kind of all pleased to me like
i get let's move on right so studies running
company and we can go ahead with that
rising is a factor for us that so we'll go for the regular chip
this is basis station is nothing

so today is
what i found one for you
what do you mean by fruit and vegetable and spongy what you mean close
drawings off and then
c. t. v. "'cause" you need internet connection and you need more thing is not just
as big as going chip and
is the design for a coffee machine
that and then it should be double curve
is and we should have it on the remote
so i understand really why they just two days speak lost control
so you're having a base station
so you and it's that's right can have chargeable batteries not
right but all these things are usually in house so we don't have much problems so component costs

you see all those i was unaware at this point of the fruit for kids
so there was a there were many other materials like wood be done in and all those things but plastic
although you know would could be a quite a stylish option if you take
inside but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the user
maybe too expensive to do
list and scroll button
and scroll button but push technology for channel selection volume control and they need exposing these are the three scroll
yes that's right it's on to the chip most
most probably not hundred percent about that

but i don't know about a net
i give the floor
and as you know and you live in conversation with your remote control
and whole thing not just a watch channel and the way it fifteen doesn't have that kind of logic in it is
crazy objects
i think that'll be fine and the beginning but after one month you read that it off the surrounded of fruits
no but i think that one free to control everything
a powerful are powered by a man though it's a button on the fruit

yes i had something some more but non vegetarian
so today is i work third meeting this would be about
and all honesty say that about to the use of the g. d. screen on the remote control because of costs so maybe
yes the thing "'cause" we want the next slide at this time of
using is that the young peoples are
and as i could see on the scroll-button is becoming really a hard thing is

this is just a mall
so if you said that
i see soundtrack for the kid is the design
it's speech since the since it's speech kind of not really speech recognition that kind of button matching
is not a three things that does it or
it's like a pumpkin off

so what are the remote control in the shape of a banana just
is no teletext to make it
i think out as an elephant
maybe just a fashion gurus like
then now they're different kind of chips one

say something that looks off like refer to have like an elf
cells and the lighting conditions are good that can be useful it'd be pretty in a week of kind
that's the states for the ease of handling and there's some other issues like we need the book then controls
like when you say double curve would actually menu
one is the basic chip and then regular chip in banana that advanced chip so we can

i you know apple has the ipods in much
that's not it's really to do control
this is just a mall like a point is devices that
so we can have regular chip all control rising is a factor
but the speaker is actually on the chip then if it's too far away from a the casing was the casing is too thick then you may not hear the the speaker

new input and that so
input and that so it's i'm not going in some of these s. c. t. v. "'cause" you need
you can but you have to pray you do it i think is a fairly simple design so you'd have to record into the device every possible combination
that would be some development what
so if you see if it is something that you can we can bring easily it to put it into the banana remote control

you lost it you know things to the remote control that looks like a banana which few buttons with only a few buttons
but i just indicate he would never actually two scroll-wheels because i think the scroll
you might you could be you know it if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device i mean we could even consider
but we can say ten or twenty five not
let's move on

sold each of you have some presentations presentation to perform
we'll start
a net at economic and oranges
is losing

three days it was is the in new long have you seen the last
right and then i'm not really if that would really appeal to everyone then maybe just a
only like i mean the sense that you can recognise a set target kind of what and
so pushbuttons the traditional users so that they don't feel the and i needed list

i think in one of us agree that it could be quite a useful things
i that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy
'cause out you know that sometimes people like to collect you know things that it all those them
this is station is with the thing

which it just until you stop scrolling and then you know just ways that station all them at once the
in united some you could have a little red light that comes up and i press that so they feeling it's really going fast or whatever
so are that's there's a two important
functionality is just you know a couple scroll-wheels not button "'cause" it's hard to get so many buttons on the banana and it's still

used the marketing expert
it would be rolling right
it looks like it's

most what they find more interesting more important needs a fancy look-and-feel instead of a instead of the car and train which was for the functional look and feel so old
in eugene in the eighties and he back this in that
so we shouldn't be yet but we get back to

look and feel so old now more core aspect not more hard core that aspect rather than a devise ways to many phones times on many buttons with instead of
so do you have to bite the things that by nine that and the base station
so component costs is going to be the least anyway

they decide that like i think she's a fruit on so
i think that's fine
still a what you mean what can have a little extra things to support additional devices like b. c. i. d. v. d. players which are usually a touch with the t. v. because

not in not that much follows not too much folk or not and not that's not the similar to a fruit because nancy that the team that would be different so
people for channel one
that's we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design as to keep the speaker personal that's

i device with the shape of some
but has to be easy to use and the whole thing you
base station even if it's just you press that button on that and and the remote control starts beeping you know this is a way of finding the remote

it's not so simple
banana mango
might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them which it just

so with the solar button you can say skip i have channels if you know if i'm going from scrolling possible in united some
i this and this may be fine i don't know if
although it if

very you may even be from mice for some people more functional and then carmine but if they have these scroll-wheels
you know what other buttons we want
we could have one because you need an on off switch way you could

that's why you're our marketing here
so it looks like going completely to forget about the l. c. d.
we decided that we can and spend twenty five euro

like a minute shouldn't
like a minute shouldn't hope you have a good

this would be about the conceptual design if i come back
worth but i think it doesn't really add much to the functional designed and it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engines

so maybe we can would be able to clarify this these questions that they had in the meeting we
had in the meeting we should take a decision on that point

so the the car investigation on the outside a cat and
objects

in that is i'm in that is and need and they kind and then all of a feature a rough loads for the tools and this
this fascinates it's freed and they this thing is free time this it was

spongy means people easy
so maybe we should we still think in design action so

or text or as an artist and
so now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries that rechargeable batteries so all the period of car find him to cut the cost

instead of visitor what are some natural and and not to know all of that or something
if you take like quality kind of wood that's got a grinding you kind of put some of an agenda

these buttons are in the fit of shape of fruits or something upload banana have something like that
usually a remote sits on that so you and

to that stands out
more than abandon

i think in my opinion we should for goes on young people because they are
right but i mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need

in much just "'cause" they have an apple and
what is it sends it is losing

probably the only thing is a banana can think of a cucumber
so it but i mean you also have to yes also have fit all the buttons and you

better
the thing is you have to norway with with buttons i have to be at some point it has to a circuit board so you

how do you wanna nicely with twenty five euros
on the whiteboard though

i've got into the to a beep or people are more the devastating never find a fancy look and feel down in the technology gonna be know in innovation so
so i will give more importance to they look and feel down right and they

so you three
's next

but at this know a kind of understanding of the phrase so i mean you
it's it's not it's a real

but the thing is they're still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production components
and the these were the findings which i saw little better than that

'cause you know some people might get annoying if we if we just dump but
but it's something that i and it really in the thing is a technology

is a technology that we can add keywords speech you were it's
it's a real recognise i he was but you know he was in a set not like a freight you train

i suppose it
suppose it so he's this is much more than be taking this technology we need to the remote control in using it's all this is

looks like a little less that i've got a topic of fruit
doable thing and that's right you have it easier

but also include this to a button but going
it'll ring the cost down and then it's

a button but going to know every design should have at a button and
but the components inside

so shall we
switch way you could that you could turn out from attacking the top of the banana but it's kind of

them you could have the engineering department if we
but a good thing you want to move feels slides you're

i don't know if that's speech recognition is you know even if we can do it i think it's not really appropriate for a television and running
so will this additional it will be might be having slightly better market for us

in that case maybe the speech recognition the speech thing to be useful just to say i'm here but
but it's probably the right to kill if you could just have a beating

the remote control so i was all the idea that we can have to kind of power supply is one is that you should
and on top of that we can have solar cells and the

the look of as you have "'cause" on both the sides if i'm right
so it symmetrical kind of thing whatever it is

but plastic as a thing is that most appropriate one it'll ring the cost down
v. because users out like this then they don't want to have one remote control for everything so will

it depends i mean
it depends i mean you have the outs the wood itself was not gonna break so you'd

but it's more easier to do a banana and plastic then it would
true but i we said on the banana idea

basis station is nothing more just it's that by which is coming from the main cable and you're having one socket on which the things it's
although you do need to include r. f. kind of structure in the remote

hope you have a good lunch

we decided not to go for speech recognition technology just because of some reasons and all honesty say

so hopefully that story speak if presentations we had that's sold

so you are you save

so you are you save d. or the presentation somewhere

used the marketing

of what i did see the difference more that i mean

i mean this to get d. player the preference of the users

what they found in other of importance from leicester more important is that people want an easy to use device

after they want something new technology it technologically speaking it's about the

instead of you is that the hot out of a device which can do all many things idea why a switch these days and to watch to see

and so in a in the u. s. a. they got trend them all the most popular feeling it's is a spongy

spongy means that it's legs

you seen the last expertise of quilts me done

no i missed that one

i them is and i saw that the fruit it's the i mean if pictures of freedom is it or seen a little it

are they so they're not like the rest of the carrot they decide that like

there is no teletext to

a of a banana just maybe

but what's the solution whole we can have some cheap like that on the remote

cell disease in the next like something

so which fruit are you thinking of

now that i had i haven't thought of any particular fruit bat

fruit bat that in that aspect of a of the remote control many colours remind some kind of visitor was some

bad you did it depends on the

maybe you can display and then let's see

but that you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit or

means buttons are in the shape of fruits these buttons

that we can discuss that right

one that maybe we should have specifying what does it either we for losing

it's fruit

'cause they have an apple and

no i think we should think about that i shape with it i device with

you know on a pear or known

they do you think we can find that the shape of a fruit which is handy to use

board so you can have things like are on a cylindrical kind of device that may be difficult to can have to build

but i like your idea that we should have a lot of buttons but done so

and you would not have they enough of the face to put their c. d. on the banana

you'll marketing expert you should tell us if you have too much not

so you so just to go first

so we'll simply you lost it you know things

for it for you then i an example

so you are user interface guy

which is a way if you'd have a conversation with the coffee machine and all remote control

it has has a mark friends as big as

microphone that so that's what you do not have gonna say it is just as big deal

as the sample sensor sample speaker

sample sensor sample speaker it means that

it means that you can recognise it can be like a match on on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back the phrase in response to that but

so i mean you know i you could build i

know i you could build i mean you could link the recognition on a certain phrase to some function on the remote control but

but the thing is we have this technology available

it but means we can kind of consider this from a you know a theoretical usability committee point without worrying too much about you know how to develop that because we have this already done

like a freight you train it for a certain for a certain phrase you say

you say the example

the example they said that they have up and running with the prototype is but actually integrated

but actually integrated that into the coffee machine that that with producing is you can say good morning

you can say good morning coffee machine me to recognise that for it and it'll play back good morning how would you like a coffee

just to adjust to play back something

it's designed it design as a fun kind of thing that

completely pointless

not completely pointless for the in the fall from the interaction on that but do you

combination just to train it's not the law and channel fifteen and whole thing not just

all this is a couple of discussion so if

no there's no but i don't know it's a half then

a half then you could be

i i don't think it's worth but i think

so the mothers more of a box like this

this is x. this could be genetically engineered for it is designed to be square so they'd attack start it in the boxes

because i think the scroll wheel is a fairly keep out of you know i think in one of us

of the remote

it's as you know a unique problem with television's is that if you have this got this scroll-wheel for the television the but you know and the t. v. "'s" not gonna be able to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll so

all them at once the scroll and have a quick glimpse all that even if it lights behind what they're doing

can you can close to speak

there's a two important to our features i think me on the right but i mean we

i mean we could even consider that made we want to sell this is a very if it's gonna be a banana you know as a pretty gimmicky kind of think that doesn't have that much functionality is

it's kind of like a spy can afford thing

i like user yes

not spend but you know charge kind of idea

right i think we would use some call there so coffee machine they about interface

the command could communicate is just to

commentator

but then you have to have a template every channel four hundred channels you

four hundred channels you have to be a tool to recognise

that's card application i would presume

i would presume that it's kind of they wouldn't design of the hand a hundred things so

but i did have one thing from a previous meeting you were talking about

were talking about being able to find of the remote control and also

and also to that extent it be a text in the remote control what having an a base station i can control of things as it might

so it's a speech and this is kind of thing something in

thing something in the store they just open up

so this is going to be about the component design so first

so first thing is we need power source for the remote control so

which that they could be chargeable batteries if there's a base station kind of thing and on top of that

then now we need plastic with some elasticity so that if you're of the remote control what's the sample can directly into pieces they should be some

for the traditionals use traditional uses we can have the pushbuttons so that they don't feel that it's in the in thing for them

would actually menu and you could like drawer something on on the whiteboard though

but like so and convex

so there are flights there a single curve and they're double go so these are the three things and

these are the three things and they are different materials that plastic

that plastic you can have the book but the side not the materials we cannot that the book

but there is no elasticity which

what in cases

not gonna break so you'd have to worry too much about the case been broken is the

the case been broken is the inside but

it's looks like a while to get in there

disable for one and i it's not very handy

what does it taste like

so i kept them all up on it

like it a banana you can have

in a missing israeli fancy and fun using is

i'm it's fine

but banana is not so handy i think that's

banana it's more handy or as compared to the setting and to get to come

it's kind of it's more you're out it's very

i don't know how you wanna hold a cap sit down and

it's very i'm gonna need it fits in the hand and you had a lot of so phase two the for the controls i get

so studies running is more

these are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us and the company and we can

you can go to the next thing then now they're

and a regular chip supports speaker support so this functionality

it could be a beep kind of thing

but the speakers actually attached to the chip in some way or is it just the signal

so any issues so where we place this chip to make you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana

so we can have a good one of the won't be so that things as like a better answer is that

answer is that hearing is concerned are we can have some gap at some place so that

so these were the component selection and these things we can

remotes

remotes objects

it's like a telephone handset is there and the base a station for the telephone handset "'cause" they're so now

so you're having the base decision and there is a button if you press

is a button if you press the button there are that are more to start beeping so you know with the remote it's

i think it's kind of people would find out what's it even if it wasn't a recharging station even if they didn't have to buy for batteries you know

that i'm a bit worried about the budget
