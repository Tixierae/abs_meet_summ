although you do need to include r. f. kind of structure in the remote
so you have the some kind of he so you need
you mean you need to kind of keep it

right but i mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need
but how many buttons do we need

of a fruit or you want to some kind of like fruit logo on
but at this know a kind of understanding of the phrase so i mean you
kind of thing that i you could use it as as a way to implement
it's kind of like a spy can afford thing
so it symmetrical kind of thing whatever it is
if you take like quality kind of wood that's got a grinding you kind of put some of an agenda
i dunno it seems a little bit kind of all pleased to me like
so is that when you say it's because of what you mean it just has an apple print which kind of
it could be a beep kind of thing

it doesn't look like a banana apple
if i have to make something that looks like a banana if you could have the colour of a banana

and all honesty say that about to the use of the g. d. screen on the remote control because of costs so maybe
so what are the remote control in the shape of a banana just
but that you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit or
you lost it you know things to the remote control that looks like a banana which few buttons with only a few buttons
know i you could build i mean you could link the recognition on a certain phrase to some function on the remote control but
at this time of course more couple of some of the features of that potential funky looking remote control
were talking about being able to find of the remote control and also
than that user wants to help control more than one device want to control more than one device from the same remote control still

switch way you could that you could turn out from attacking the top of the banana but it's kind of
and on top of that we can have solar cells and the
but then i like a banana you can you hold it like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and it's
i'm just wondering actually "'cause" you know i this all fruit thing with the banana it's it's saying like if that seems a bit kind of like an e. a few people would really wanna banana but what if it
banana but what if it was kind of a stylised or not you know
or not you know rather than having it kind of you know a yellow one really looking zachary like a banana could make it kind of so
but you know i just maybe not exactly the same texture the banana and this kind

but what's the solution whole we can have some cheap like that on the remote
remotes objects
usually a remote sits on that so you and
means on the remote

fruit bat that in that aspect of a of the remote control many colours remind some kind of visitor was some
the remote control so i was all the idea that we can have to kind of power supply is one is that you should

it's designed it design as a fun kind of thing that
i would presume that it's kind of they wouldn't design of the hand a hundred things so
i that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy

you if you said that the t. v. at the fancy thing that's true you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that we not have any
so if you see if it is something that you can we can bring easily it to put it into the banana remote control

to buy and need a corner remote control
is not just buying an eel control the remote you do need my income for a remote buying
suppose it so he's this is much more than be taking this technology we need to the remote control in using it's all this is
so first thing is we need power source for the remote control so
then now we need plastic with some elasticity so that if you're of the remote control what's the sample can directly into pieces they should be some
that's the states for the ease of handling and there's some other issues like we need the book then controls
it's very i'm gonna need it fits in the hand and you had a lot of so phase two the for the controls i get

which is a way if you'd have a conversation with the coffee machine and all remote control
and as you know and you live in conversation with your remote control

and also to that extent it be a text in the remote control what having an a base station i can control of things as it might
base station even if it's just you press that button on that and and the remote control starts beeping you know this is a way of finding the remote
so you're having the base decision and there is a button if you press

input and that so it's i'm not going in some of these s. c. t. v. "'cause" you need
c. t. v. "'cause" you need internet connection and you need more thing is not just
so on for the presentations so we need
so we need to take some good decisions about about for going to do so
so that they need training we have to work
or we need a power on off switch as
but how many units that we need to so what

but banana is not so handy i think that's
banana it's more handy or as compared to the setting and to get to come
