we can have a fine it's aspect which is
is made a which are not enough yellowed though this is one
this is one but i made
that at a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons
this is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation and the
now as a somewhere all on a scale of in between these two
easy to use
all say it to our costs a mean and buy a row

i like the minutes the infrared thing that's
to hold and feels kids and as a similar
makes it much just we're gonna see what you thought that at
like a compass point you know
so in terms of
false good and designed buttons into it buttons
sellable it quirky you know
you also think about the energy is in

how we came up again for a
that should be ten minutes
and we ran out of time
them both yellow or black buttons it's just so we don't have
that they provide it to me
he hand dynamo battery kinetic solar cells

are we ready to start
which is it a spreadsheet an excel spreadsheet and i know
because we're only given a forty minute i'm free to get it all in the including a production evaluation so we're going
so we're going to make a very fast track
ten minutes
we're down to the prototype presentation

colour i think i definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons because
we don't have any particular restrictions on that
i mean it looks just like a logo that arrangement of the keys like a compass
i think they are different l. a.
i see if it technologically innovative i'd say it's quite innovative because the
because the right really many to have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons i know we're not doing

to come up together or disappear one of them or how we came up
material so i have to say that material can scroll
so that's for material colour
the price up as

we you reviewed the previous minutes before that it's each
see what i is heavily relied on up here it is instead of pure functionality so in that
so in that respect it is quite fancy
buttons and they'll be mean everything depending on what menu show a

and i'm gonna now use the the board
i see technologically innovative easy to use trendy buttons access buttons good buttons ugly sellable and other and fact
two "'cause" we still we need to get somebody in he's good for programming for the menus and things i mean it's not just like
i mean it's not just like i mean it's not like and you know on a normal chunky remote every button was i mean something different ways

but how do we feel in terms of this is fancy
it depends what you mean by fancy really "'cause" when i
really "'cause" when i think a fancy i think if it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and you know like hawk curly madison
what do with conference in the

and for you to get sarah present the evaluation criteria we can have a
product that could be suggested to management on
so it doesn't really colour t.

perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of slacked
i'm not lost just self thank goodness
thank goodness and

on that and i suggested yellow with black buttons for the company logo a slogan an image might be a good idea based on the requirements that it and provided to us
quite a feature is like the ipod scroll wheel but s. r.
that's what makes me think of mobile phones hours try i was thinking

is that a fair presentation of what happened
you know curvatures it to your liking
a light of a style s. r. is that the "'kay"

course we need someone who's experienced with the television so i like the minutes
the components a cheap to make
terms we have to evaluate one of them

this is on off switch "'cause"
of a banana out which is also and easy
can scroll down and then see what else

what the functions of these buttons as up down left and right in the different menus
and i've made a list of criteria to look at and
and so i'm gonna leave this up as the last thing but

lack of buttons all over the place right
that's false
new

to manufacture we have simple rubber push buttons
it's just the in the end of this fashion
it's good point

that's also like texting you know
fancy i'd say maybe is that it's
we have a trendy further down but

everything is we do need to develop our technology of we actually had to programme the menus and what sort of
and other and fact i hope that it you want to do some additional terms because these are things
because these are things that have been brought up some of them seem rather

with this concept i think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative
openly
trendy it's the and i say specifically spongy fruity

not almost
almost there's one more thing i have to get out of the have to

then for the two of you present your prototype and for you to
you finish

and as you can see that's what we do next one this like so the first thing
so the first thing i have to do is close this so

i need to open mind o. p. g. and
for "'em" curve it's kind of solution hand helds makes you feel

as we i can more easily flip it
is more curved like a banana but

are we'd use plastic with the rubber casing i think was the consensus powered by kinetic
i think that's a really superior they're both

back to this meeting
you just pick the pen

and it's gonna have the logo in printed on it in that
as as incorporate all of our insight into this evaluation exercise so

at this issue in the p. c. no just means right on it easy to see them a feature of it is
them a feature of it is just a simple design simple lack of

makes you feel to hold
can we say it's cost saving

material i think he's gonna talk about quite a bit but i think
i don't have very much to add

bit but i think we have two different options because
and what sort of you text boxes can appear the palm of the screen but

i like an existing remote control but mould it's move
whereas i was with a light with this one or

or shut be the case can be i. the spongy no but all plastic not
not actually about combination of the two but it can

of the two but it can be hard to lose we have
if you can just imagine banana shape with these pets as black so what we

but because it's right in the mold it
it kinda makes you think sort of organic touchy feely kitty it's more like

which i like that sort of image is very
is very big and championed child friendly and

thing for it because there's be rigid
i like the fact that on button on the keys it's a prominent role

that's not a lot to go wrong the components a cheap
this is really identify know

one to seven faults and i'm gonna
one to seven appropriate

what our price is that gonna go on there as price of materials
in terms of elegant fancy call it you have do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow should go with

i think we'll go with that respect
but i do like the channel

be it's fancy so
i think we need to them both yellow

a to this wanna buy a boat
i think between the two somewhere between the two is true

so say a false
about the energy is in the kinetic energy if this is

inches and we still haven't decided a specific sponginess or specific
something people like

that instead of "'em" it's attractive and then make
we're a little over carefully through the meeting in the next

to you and all the figure out the it
thank you for every once top of that

have to make that this attachment open

will open that one times right

in the meantime

closing things down

it's now quarter of for this is of another

this is of another forty minute one so it will

so it will end at each for twenty five

"'kay" right a rich

right a rich and that is as before for me to open the meeting for us to go over

for us to go over the previous minutes then

that with the minutes from the previous minutes that should be

from meeting three

from meeting three is the right with you if

is the right with you if i don't switch it to show just use it as we i can

all those we're here for the last meeting we you reviewed

each of you major presentations

we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in this presentations be

be market trend of fruit and veg spongy a fancy and how we get more than technologically innovative and that more than easy

we decided chip one for it would be used are we

powered by kinetic energy there was

there was no decision made on a curvatures or double curve richer or straight perhaps

looking like a scroll but

but it's really a pushbutton technology excuse my spelling that was actually in the use that is

that is top of find the scenes is pushbutton which we are

which we are going to take have a very good one grasp on doing that in production

we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could

we did have a few production issues and co-ordination of the various bits and we had

and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time

are we had to follow that up and prepare for

and prepare for the last one and i'm be close

and i'm be close to sit

to sit ran out of time is that a fair

woo to

and it says a curved easy to hold can tell it's a small with take easy buttons this is

this is like a scroll but

like a scroll but they are pushbuttons and they enter

and they enter take it into different menus course we need

the infrared thing that's gonna zap that the television

that is but i'm will work this is on

off switch "'cause" i think we do need that i

i think we do need that i think it's a balance and it's gonna have

as for whites actually made of what the functions of these

all over the place right for "'em"

different options because we didn't have another one which

another one which what is in the shape of the now nicest if you can imagine

nicest if you can imagine s. as yellow with black buttons like just like a spare the shape of a banana out which is

and easy to hold and feels

and as a similar sort of scroll push button technology just

technology just slight difference and also with on

also with on off switch it's infra-red

i hadn't is in the in hearts with plastic

so like i like an existing

this one or makes it much just

so we have the two options we can fall either this move hard plastic or the spongy rubber depending on cost restraints and what we

what conclusion region we discuss it

buttons because that's the company colours but if anybody's gonna

but if anybody's gonna suggestions am i willing to you consider them as

just depends what you think about these ideas and

maybe keep their see what you think about that

to add to be the case

still on off button just cough up or shut be

be hard to lose we have the technology to do that

and as for the actual components steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture we have

which provide more functionality we need to be

be the diode that actually does the infrared is at the end that's

at the end that's the store called nominal it's just the

colour steph six point one colour

at that as for the fruit or organic feel like this one is fruitshaped this one hasn't

this one has no obvious connections to a fruit but because it's

you'd expect it to be like a child's for you remote control instead of a real one which i like

she can't examine the pressure see how they feel in the hand

hold on to see

hold on to see you know curvatures

i see the own office and back

so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it

you don't at a rate it comes after all

and then you can use your thumb

and it was partly but for the design that but it could be moved

i could see this thing unless it's reinforced having a problem with

we see that's why a hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it because

that we really like that design i mean it looks

three a kind of

just up down left and right and

down left and right and we think we could make quite a feature

hours try i was thinking a business i what does that remind me of this

and it's a very simple design that's not a lot to go wrong

this text and

it's also in terms of from being lost it's quite it looks quite different you

know i have several for remotes and

and they look the same at the closing after

at the closing after this is

but we do definitely think that it's a viable option

the next item is evaluation

we're finished

so i take your

and the method here is to evaluate new remote control in terms of the user requirements and a hot trends that you spend a marketing department so

this means we're going to go for the priority use that were raised by the consumers

i'm going to do and use the whiteboard and i've made a list

last thing but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false going over these different criteria so

some of them seem rather close like a

close like a overlap

the price

and like we actually know and then a place that we can

that we can pretend

'cause you said

i call these quite a minimalist

yes plain simple clean design

simple and fine but

fine but i mean i do see what i is

so in that respect i think we'll go with that

and it just maybe we need a different word other than fancy i'd say maybe

and i can identify call and

no these are the exact terms of the

it's stylish

we didn't really let's use a elegant all the

a elegant all the people the word on the street is

let's take it to the next up all

should go with the yellow in

the yellow in terms of i think that's a really superior

it's just so we don't have any more at all to represent so that if you can just imagine

so what we really need to decide is whether we want that a banana shape or just a purely blop or some sort of abstraction between the two that isn't that

like a banana but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana you know with that groups of the stock and so

i think that many of us are abstract you have to look at the yellow one and say we caught the banana

minutes of that you i really like "'em" i like a banana but i

so that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now as a somewhere

but i mean in terms we have to evaluate

it's more true than false about that too

technologically innovative

i don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept i

openly

maybe only after a few inches and we still

we have to worry about how we're past will be if it's this kind of discipline on that but spongy i think

do anything that's gonna work but

excess but it's no

either access buttons

but that's false

there are more intuitive buttons yes

people don't spend all the other way sellable

it could be quite good round like a good little object

in terms of

with the energy

if this is gonna be a environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy

it is gonna be kind of a

but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet so

it yet so we're not completely about that but

you're still on that later stage anything

anything else including price do you have any

do you have any idea about price or other features

think instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop we haven't got a lot

develop we haven't got a lot expensive components in there

yes the instincts that's true

or should i go to two or three

that's not a cheap thinking

something different ways this one is only got four buttons and they'll

a what we need somebody to develop that

and i'm gonna should change couple days so

'cause i have to do an average and then

and then access buttons

displaying no access buttons

i know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition

but it's but we either a friend of the pushbutton market

let me know if any of these if you're can think of any other thing to change here if you think i should change the innovative or at other features if not

if not all average does

in the next big thing is be fine it's

how that if i passes back to you and

an issue can see it so that's the same thing i'm not

and we're going to be used what's called as a spreadsheet that they

it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device
