and how many of those will be need for the only
we need to say how many buttons all

either access buttons
and then access buttons
displaying no access buttons

buttons because that's the company colours but if anybody's gonna
still on off button just cough up or shut be
i see technologically innovative easy to use trendy buttons access buttons good buttons ugly sellable and other and fact
false good and designed buttons into it buttons
there are more intuitive buttons yes
and the buttons what's the buttons made of rubber
we don't have to have rubber buttons because we have got a double
could i mean it's not hard to describe what you mean just one where it's that point saying at photographs and saying we quite a next button and today rain there so much to

and as a similar sort of scroll push button technology just
to manufacture we have simple rubber push buttons
simple "'cause" we just got push buttons so
got push buttons so we can do with simple which
interface button push button interface it that's what we're using isn't it
no it just says push button interface a button supplements

i think we need to them both yellow
i think that many of us are abstract you have to look at the yellow one and say we caught the banana
i think we need that for of them the banana
you need to doubleclick on a look at it

off switch "'cause" i think we do need that i
i think we do need that i think it's a balance and it's gonna have
which provide more functionality we need to be
and it just maybe we need a different word other than fancy i'd say maybe
i think you need to reverse the kind of

buttons and they'll be mean everything depending on what menu show a
because the right really many to have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons i know we're not doing

what the functions of these buttons as up down left and right in the different menus
i mean it's not just like i mean it's not like and you know on a normal chunky remote every button was i mean something different ways
something different ways this one is only got four buttons and they'll

and they enter take it into different menus course we need
everything is we do need to develop our technology of we actually had to programme the menus and what sort of
two "'cause" we still we need to get somebody in he's good for programming for the menus and things i mean it's not just like
a what we need somebody to develop that

and the method here is to evaluate new remote control in terms of the user requirements and a hot trends that you spend a marketing department so
but i mean in terms we have to evaluate
terms we have to evaluate one of them

on that and i suggested yellow with black buttons for the company logo a slogan an image might be a good idea based on the requirements that it and provided to us
nicest if you can imagine s. as yellow with black buttons like just like a spare the shape of a banana out which is
colour i think i definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons because
them both yellow or black buttons it's just so we don't have

but it's really a pushbutton technology excuse my spelling that was actually in the use that is
technology just slight difference and also with on
technologically innovative
i see if it technologically innovative i'd say it's quite innovative because the
to maintain old technology is that way

be market trend of fruit and veg spongy a fancy and how we get more than technologically innovative and that more than easy
so we have the two options we can fall either this move hard plastic or the spongy rubber depending on cost restraints and what we
just depends what you think about these ideas and
it depends what you mean by fancy really "'cause" when i
and rubber myself but it depends on the cost i

are we'd use plastic with the rubber casing i think was the consensus powered by kinetic
i hadn't is in the in hearts with plastic
to add to be the case
or shut be the case can be i. the spongy no but all plastic not
i mean i still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself but
we'll come back if we can do the rubber being at it at the moment
'cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top
they could be plastic we don't have to have rubber

is more curved like a banana but
looks like a somewhat all single curve "'cause" the
but we single curve isn't it
for of them the banana one single curve here
single curved so it's
now single curve
