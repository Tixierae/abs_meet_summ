and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control
we just for fresh the r. a call of making the finest remote control available we decided
not as remote controls ball ones you recognise
and if you call the on the labels like i did it remote control functions of the technology is
watch and it means that children all three of having their remote control side
the details of the components design as you can see there we have is the board main board of the remote control the underside
you wanna wind up your remote control if we can use it right

then d. the user interface designer explored some of the technical functions of the remote
all these then we came up with a couple ideas for what we think the design of a remote will be
we can still designed it to peace the remote without having a base having one of them be a base station but just how would be
however no of course it would be like design two remotes pretty much so

it could be graphical display the actual remote control the actual control paul maybe could have like an apple we'd is a control for the menus so like
how about affecting be surface of the actual a remote control

there and look at different types of material that might these are users who wants spongy feeling remote controls
just get away use all of a user can use products look like remote there's a graphical use
so then i look at new products that on the mark it's not as remote controls
menu or you'll be working on t. look and feel design

that remotes zap a lot of
and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote because increasing cost in increasing complexity we
and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote habits
how that would power d. remotes and the lamp if we were to
is that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote but we can
he for when you buy a remote you can buy
personalise your remote
and then just had a simple sort of handheld thing as a devised "'cause" that's remote i don't

they just that's just point out so inconsistent it is a user interface and remotes you can
brian you'll be working on be user interface design

that's easy to lose remote
and fight blade the remote should be easy to use

all with the exterior design is but my question
there is a picture on about it and say designer channels with your voice don't
just little things like that which we need to make clear in the design
and then they can't help it should be economically designs that is
that's industrial design for cranes like that
design we would just be able to make it flat and
the fruit design
just design wise
design which we saw there

is but my question as i mean this area technically speaking you kind of takes their mails what their remote controls and i'm
you have the squishy a kind of remote control than an l. c. d. screen may be affected by the movement as we might not be able

that depends have the it's it's a control a problem what should we can watch before
you may be control on the tell all problem all on the control that and then just had
as long as the plight of the rubber is no when you the controls yes

and straight design
straight design pretty much which i assume

which should go along what do you look and feel design danger interface so that

now you can see this is the rubber button version of it
the way it works is that you have the keys here the rubber buttons
on so you'd probably have to stay grab the with the just traditional rubber button

does that to peace idea out over that
so we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to do on this

and then it should look different than what's out there
habits be something that looks different
or i dunno different options for female male target groups and then
and remotes you can see the picture what is a state of the mobile phones can will also differ buttons on making it more complicated
when we got more components in a different remotes
have any details to comes to the cost but it will be significant difference
you did to sell in different colours or scrolls and different
or scrolls and different yellow's of those that's
completely different roles
