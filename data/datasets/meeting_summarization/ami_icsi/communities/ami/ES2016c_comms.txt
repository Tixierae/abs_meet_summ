i'll just take a few minutes and go through d. previous minutes
and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up
and then you all had suggested that the energy source and the user interface discussing some of those on that we could change a little but we need
that was a banana shape
also calls "'cause"
'cause mute this one is
personalise your remote
i see crazy
they give an example of a coffee machine when you program a question you problem the answer machine use phones calling
just get away use all of a user can use products look like remote there's a graphical use
there's a graphical use you know the pictures and on the screen command line
there is a picture on about it and say designer channels with your voice don't
and if you call the on the labels like i did it remote control functions of the technology is
just little things like that which we need to make clear in the design
which just sends it over to the transistors and all that that
that's the approximate cost per hundred doesn't for the titanium
a choice and squishy is hip so i'd say the not go for that let's see now
are we want and rubber a week now

their button or tracking device
and fight blade the remote should be easy to use
so they always get the idea that they're getting something that's new and mother and sleek can
which then of course shines infrared light on to the television but i will
right solar cell
solar cell is interesting a if
the kinetic energy thing might work but the same probably lying
probably lying around you first have to shake it before it starts to work so i'd
up so we don't need that
you have the squishy a kind of remote control than an l. c. d. screen may be affected by the movement as we might not be able
let's see now solar
with the cover and
so i don't know about so it possible so you know it'll mean plastic but then
i would nominate they just
like say just the underside of someone can be done i assume
the fruit design
what about the smell to

alright is everyone here
from energy source what we would use batteries because
i. is we brought up the idea of having two pieces which we could discuss further
they just that's just point out so inconsistent it is a user interface and remotes you can
so then i look at new products that on the mark it's not as remote controls
and then on the right is also an ipod which is
we could use solar cells
or a device that was not nnn much further specified that provides kinetic energy so
so just like watches no you just move them
so that's for the scroll wheel it limits
it limits a choice and
what do we see that's not a problem since we have decided or against solar cells i assume right
with rubber we could tush pretty much shape of the way we wanted it but we
and then this one issue for a bad source which is a source dunno i ask such a thing

go through me through the minutes first
just the basics and
all with the exterior design is but my question
is it possibility and the things simple
and the things simple really
button might be clear transistor
transistor amplifies signal and and sense than just as a signal to the l. e. d. which translates the signal to a infrared light the sense
the lower part of it
which makes a very conventional but there for traditional ice you
design we would just be able to make it flat and
and straight design
straight design pretty much which i assume
plastic but then when the people hold it still be
it still be some spongy

the most important finding was that the fancy look and feel seems to be twice as important to the user is at the current functional look and feel design but i think
and again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own posters backs it up and
is that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote but we can
i think with a really discover that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design but i think that
push buttons plastic give you the biggest the righty of options maybe not the nicest
such a thing of it yellow and
we're supposed to stick to the company colour so that's
states the colours

that remotes zap a lot of
they only use a finite amount of buttons
so i it was looking at trend watching
much information i was given a fruit executive summary and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at and then i'll
the outside so maybe we have something that's somewhat removable or i dunno
or i dunno different options for female male target groups and then
your voice don't i see speech samples controls four devices t. v. cable satellite v. c. r. d. v. d. and audio

it's pre squishy that would
now let's first go through it was for the material so we can use
which also makes a base station up so we don't
how ever
this however may exclude certain materials you
that's a tricky thing
or scrolls and different yellow's of those that's

this is our conceptual
this is our conceptual design meeting
minutes then each of you will have your presentation
and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control
does certainly can be done yes
yellow and

and then it should look different than what's out there
and then i'll just tell you some personal preferences that i got from that
i we could but the mobile phones and other technology that out there and
light the sense in the t. v. can see the infrared light and seeing the signal reacts appropriately
if we have most of the six use sophisticated scroll-wheel or rather than this very basic setup that we that just presented the chip has to be most more sophisticated and that's more expensive as have any details
have any details to comes to the cost but it will be significant difference

whether it's in the shape of the colours are all of that for
for technologically innovative we've talked about the tracking of i. is we
solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex surface or remote control what do we see that's
which i assume would exclude so the more sophisticated versions
with the cover and
you did to sell in different colours or scrolls and different

the television but i will recognise what's signal it's getting and we'll do would you tell it
works in arizona but in denver a not so
we have an for scroll wheels
however
however many comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod i have one big objection and that is that we have to fit an l. c. d. into the remote controls this
like the ipod

we decided that are we know that we need to use company colours company logo
our marketing expert i give us some eight information from interviews with a hundred different remote users with some statistics
habits be something that looks different
command line where you have to type things in need a response
so what have we lemon

which we were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple
and some personal preferences they were fine and that would be that it should be a user oriented remote something simple
or so anybody still alright
i think batteries are probably the way to go
it's tricky or

and i think we decided that the expense was not necessarily worth it and it was probably
i was sensor information from the companies are they i. d. technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology where you can program questions in such devices
things using times and i know pointing down which may suggest volume down could become these just as a v. for volume just little
the details of the components design as you can see there we have is the board main board of the remote control the underside
the underside that's pretty cheap piece of technology we in top left

marketing were watching trends
very is covering
company colour so that's yellow and grey so
yellow and grey
what have we lemon banana is

of the technology is
and as things like this which is a teacher know that
we in top left side you can see the chip would just be were talking about this was just a device to recognise the signals the input and it could
and it could pass it on to row off for the transistors and like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal which later on
how about affecting be surface of the actual a remote control

this is the circuit board from the other side
we could also use a wood or titanium
move be the actual device and disprove provided with some energy so
and if you wanna make it a particular shape use plastic
way we wanted it but we can all that scroll wheels and we can all to add an l. c. d. screen

the younger people so they want it older people did not and
then d. the user interface designer explored some of the technical functions of the remote
and i will leave that i think that so
one with a flag in one with the banana and one that's a spongy

and it was probably a gimmick that but increasingly where on the consumers years
some notes as a list of us and trying is inspiration but
rubber as rubber
rubber that is used in santa stress balls so it's pre squishy

banana shape
is but my question as i mean this area technically speaking you kind of takes their mails what their remote controls and i'm
and then the spongy feel i we
you wanna wind up your remote control if we can use it right

the point mary and then a sight you'd have to stop it need to be clear on your devices as to what you know things using times
it could be graphical display the actual remote control the actual control paul maybe could have like an apple we'd is a control for the menus so like
so like you think it's more complex complicated and then
are more information on possible materials as what we can

we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy had to remove it
i was at the possibility
at the possibility of having a graphical display like a screen like the ipod
or make it just push buttons

we just have a t. v. remote
the properly it green greenish board this is what we saw on the first slide just flip over
as we might not be able to put it in there so

all these then we came up with a couple ideas for what we think the design of a remote will be
something that will fit into easily in the someone's hand
and with a just a few buttons just the basics

try it and also as opposed to last year this year the material is expected to be spongy and feel
and you know you just stick on just a lot of things that the socket from but i would nominate
as an optional plastic shell with the rubbery coding on a certain spots

i thought about the interface concept of how the customer will use we use the consumer use the actual device
going to bore you with couple of descriptions of the interior
chip but that's a lot to me to decide great so

i think the time for a set a user friendly now what the minimum buttons maybe with
maybe with source suggested is to par think if it was to have a speech recognition thing you may
you may be control on the tell all problem all on the control that and then just had

as what we can and cannot do
but it's just for the start-up and
do we not you know how the shape of the school on the screen and

connection the chip senses the connection and knows what but you press it produces
lower part of it if you can see the properly it green
so i'd say what we're stuck with really is on the basic battery

you can see the circuit board itself that's the
we are talking "'cause" that's the simple and cheap as the version of the same time we're talking something
maybe not the nicest feel

what to do is you have i don't have cables but you have the connections actually in these lines on the board
amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared them up there
now you can see this is the rubber button version of it

we're talking something more complicated of course it's going to be more expensive as
feel not much originality read
so the rubber and what the rubbery we can should have are we want and rubber

that doesn't affect
that doesn't affect the functional side of it all like say
great so at risk of what is the

say we don't make it a particular fruit shape that's
and orange banana whatever you
just design wise

and some sort of locator their button or
this is the voice is a voice recognition remote control which can control is mostly rice is out

how that would power d. remotes and the lamp if we were to
our interface a chance have pushbuttons in which

were watching trends i suppose that
year they won't necessarily the actual shape of thing

can i have he's a few years right
as far as fashion update we were in the fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths shoes and furniture is that might

unfortunately i wasn't given too much information i was
but i think that even if it's very subtle we need to kind of track our consumers so they

the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative and again these are
feel to it you

i mean i the two options are free had a remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable if you can
however we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option and

there and look at different types of material that might these are users who wants spongy feeling remote controls
they just a next year they won't necessarily

he for when you buy a remote you can buy
are you know you lose the device behind the couch for we can

watch and it means that children all three of having their remote control side
let's see i'm going to bore you

and then they can't help it should be economically designs that is
that's industrial design for cranes like that

just thought surely
to the remote

is that little things like that huge
things which is just something like that you could ninety or grandma right

its job was to for you to press a key than to translate that key press into infrared light signals the received by the television when you press a key
it also makes these

these are the actual keys that are being pressed the
but then sends a signal to the chip on the other side to be

and that's it is on the signal now this is the simple
now this is the simple version

see you are i don't have an information on that however our company
but there's certain restrictions to certain materials now

however our company can provide us with with the titanium so i'd assume i'm i was given an to use it certainly is an expense
of that but i was given an o. k. a.

you can have an l. c. d. screen
of plastic as i understand that you can use any form

we just for fresh the r. a call of making the finest remote control available we decided

with some statistics that backed what we were thinking before people but they are remotes

people but they are remotes for ugly

and that they often lose that's

that's easy to lose remote

kind of mixed response on the speech recognition the

d. simple versus be complex the simple one been better

the simple one been better for user the complex better for an engineer

and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote because increasing cost in increasing complexity we

and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote habits

finally our industrial designer give us a rundown of how dear immobile work

batteries because we don't wanna have a cable

to have one the user interface then we connect to a chip which would work with the infra-red controls to send a signal to the t. v.

and with scrolling function also

i suppose that you can have it is

but i think we've kind of already discussed before

so from that as we've already said we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel

we need to keep it simple have limited buttons but i think

but i think that to peace idea of might be really beneficial for

i need to incorporate those fashion trend of fruits and vegetables i don't know what

and i'm not how they feel about having fruity logos on the outside so maybe

it's possibly like search to but in

search to but in first second possibly

possibly like a cover like they have for mobile phones

'cause like for sponginess

there is covers

we could leave that to the cover department

we are know they've got nothing to do all day

crazy

but keep in mind our own ideas and they had

just get away use

and remotes you can see the picture what is a state of the mobile phones can will also differ buttons on making it more complicated

not as remote controls ball ones you recognise

the one on the left is a similar to what we'd do up on the board in the previous meeting as scroll down functions on the side users

on the side users make those out

which is you know possible the simplest thing is to use that i'm really is

i'm really is knowledge this is

knowledge this is a big scroll menu you use of go through that is it

that depends have the it's it's a control a problem what should we can watch before

before general john l. only allows them to access d. channels that depends on to watch and

side of it is a possibility of having one remote country you know what we decide to component when we got more components

when we got more components in a different remotes

and then just had a simple sort of handheld thing as a devised "'cause" that's remote i don't

i don't it could be graphical

no it's designed are going to also

make sense like sense

also good for animals

like a screen please

just to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there and that we do have to fit in there are more information

and i'll show you we're talking about you know

which later on as being is being transferred to a infrared lamp which

so much for the workings of v. of the remote control itself its

when you press a key you complete a specific connection the

you press it produces a morse code a line signal specific to that button might

itself that's the cheapest the way to make electronic connections on the market what to do

that are being pressed the close of the electric circuits but then sends

the other side to be behind here which just

the way it works is that you have the keys here the rubber buttons

here the rubber buttons as metal a plate on the other side which close the circuit here and

we also restricted and the use of are outer shell or in the material that we could use for all the shelf

i haven't gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic

that would serve that purpose

it certainly is an expense of material i'm aware

so we can use it's plastic rubber wood titanium it also makes these

as for the energy source we're talking about that shortly and the other meeting

we could use this what i was offered a what we could use is a basic a clear a battery right

it dynamo

interestingly enough

so i personally have to say that dynamo is i have question for you wanna wind up

but if we're gonna wind up on that

in which the production of a preacher and for which our company is expert

a better option and they are possible we have an

there's also restrictions how to make comes to the chip if we have

i'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have more sophisticated chip but

with be titanium we cannot to make it a curved design we would

but they use all of the spongy and the plastic casing you

the plastic casing you think in the mobile phones and if you have a base plastic but then the house of a as a cover on it which is just sort of soft so i don't know

but there for know rubber will be used liked

so plastic is titanium yes but this of course and phones the form of plastic

latex

rubber and and titanium also seems to be tricky and comes to the form so a

so a way to go is if you wanna scroll wheel you make it flat and angular add an l. c. d. screen and then you can choose either plastic or titanium or would

and an l. c. d. screen at the scroll wheel that would be fine or make it just

that's a good like the surface off

yellow and grey

grapefruit is what we
