and said that we easiness of use is the is important as but
something easy to use you said something easy

but if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seventy six so
i'd like a shape screen i think that's more

easy to use easy
easy to use easy it's at
this i mean there's seven seventy square it easy dot
easy so let's say an average size and it should not be
my first ideas because a court a small yellow and is that it should be easy to take in your hand at fault about ban an hour something that's which is fruits and
i think if we have a spongy later on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that you know
an event easy to use and so it would

i think the biggest are there will be the easy to use feature we'll see
i think i think the feature easy to do is more important than being fancy but
the only important thing is to be a bit to take it in inside and easy so

secondly that a remote control needs to be technologically innovative
so i'm going to talk about the need to be able to how this remote control should be a hearer to be more easy to use i think
should be you should then need to do this all pen did the board can the start treaty and learning how to use this this the remote control
and the shape of remote control should be innovative each can do it should be taken easy to your hand it should not
and just switch of one change or just which can channel change but some of that are in the remote control and need the user need

so what's the size of the device
and it's are so we're already kids to the size of the and so that was the device

and it's just one courts from the main boards to the screen which can be elsewhere so this will
but no problem to me to get the screen
that is the screen is but the board that's a problem

hello this meeting it's for should be focused on consider are designed of the remote control
so so they i just whenever the t. v. and see some recent results we've had from looking at this some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world
so pre cover and their remote control fits into the finnish you can agree and also i
had three our remote control reflects that so in some way
generally in their early this remote controller that should be something get in mind when you the first feature is just to be easy to use so
they should be placed in it would the position you know inside the remote control and
control i don't know if i can explain that but
wants a smaller remote control
i suppose that the that this remote control wanna be in the room like this where there's like the thing than that people but

be which can be spongy but is to be this size and the t.
maybe in put a critique in a box and spongy thing along she's that when
and you mean to first leo would be spongy so
like doing a spongy than a year as a banana and you can do

seven inch t. f. t. screen which is good
these seven inch t. f. t. screen how big is it
seven to seven inch yes
usually when they say seven inch i think it's a don't know

control so what i've on the as i said i think it's better to put a more frequent for the key buttons which are used small in a meeting of the remote controller and they should be bigger in size
because if it's it too small we can use it at home know
a small control i can

thank you it should be it should have around age still then it's easier and maybe
easier and maybe they just like some voiced some do a c. p. g.'s easier to take inside and the
and also i think if we put some some buttons in the size of the remote control it can be used easier not
easier not on remote control i don't know

that's our company to develop the seventy seven thing or sort out
or sort out one's seven
so at least seventy seven
no i don't think it's a one by seven i think it's events of
i think it's events of that one only seven usually when they say
is in from my perspective seven is the president's and it is it still
for me but so one to seven at least but

not i'm not speaking and all the real shape of the device but the shape of the inside of the device so there will
do a six you can take that into some d. c. d. can take inside and easier because it's designed for your fit at eighteen didn't work on your finger shape than your bottom shape still

have we decided that we're gonna use this t. f. t. screen
so for the same price we have for screens
for example if wasn't what did see if we choose to lot of smaller device we can choose is that a such a screen
but for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens i think be using bit smaller screen is better because
but if you want to look at the screen and bad i know
screen i think that's more important than saving a bit of money on the t. f. t. screen
