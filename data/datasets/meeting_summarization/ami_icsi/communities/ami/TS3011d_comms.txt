by not using the voice recognition feature because it's a
with the voice recognition feature and

the feel of remote control is spongy
there are other remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy there are there yes but it's not be

i think that this device which is a learning curve
is the device easy to use

you can add very much functionality by using the voice recognition on
'cause of with the voice recognition you could add anything you want so

the basic part everybody can use it's so that's easy to
and it's quite easy it's possible
easy way i think it's a good product i only

and for a while they start to develop some skills and the voice recognition functions and
at and the voice recognition as that maybe
but maybe you do want to programme button to for example activate the voice recognition or train the force voice recognition
i'm a button for and disabling the voice recognition
the voice recognition and of course it's hard to learn i think
all for much but voice recognition could at all
can use your voice to program it's
to use because those remote controls don't all for voice recognition and this one

locate the remote controls enough features
if you ask yourself bit of an features i don't think it is it has all the features and a normal remote have
so i think it is a this is remote control with a very high level features although there are

it becomes a very dull remote control i know but it's
although i think we eat we could still make a remote control that up applies more too young people
not many remotes have to solar think
but there are two parts in this remote control what you see here
talk about it but you do have remote controls that are able to adapt another signal so
you place it a regular remote control in front of the other one hit the one or the two or the three whatever and it records the series d. c. the signals so you could
because a regular programmable remote control contains a really a lot of buttons at least forty buttons so
it's not very expensive for remote control that have this functionality
and original remote control to any t. v. kind the phillips remote control you pay

what it was a selling price fifty
the selling price or would be

fancy look and feel so
if you look at be what we could do to make it more to make it just between the twelve euro fifty
i know maybe we should look at and focus on other
of our option that's when you look in the market when you look
maybe even because it doesn't look at phones
looks hard

at two or three will or will be
seven three no
you have the two years or two three and three
three and three may
yes so if you want to have a conclusion as three then you wouldn't make a four if you fill

novice users you use is device as the normal uses use remote control and for a while
but all the users when you to this device need something like that then
so that's easy to use this for novice user
this for novice user when
when you have a more advanced than average user such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions
and i think it's easy to use for both at types of users
because he is already he or she is already had sense user so

the most important function is easy to use the zapping channel switching volume
of the more advanced functions are probably it harder
i mean ease of use does not only apply to the most basic functions it's
right and that but i and it says user will find the voice recognition function easy to use
maybe we should have a radar function
but you can learn this thing all these functions and it's easy
now and the function of a failing and and oval or an an object

about fifty euros
it's more than fifty euros it's quite expensive

there's the basic idea our product that
yes i think we've six to sixty in developing a product that's actually quite good but not for this kind of markets and not for this kind of price so
the product is a high call it has a high quality and this advanced but
we'll go further on what the rest of the evaluation about the project itself not about the product
no it's just the same product that is already on the market
