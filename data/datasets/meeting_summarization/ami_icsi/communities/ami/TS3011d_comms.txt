i think these are the most important that's right
is it fancy
in this case is
is it sense
the yellow rubber i think so
you like the rubber at all
that's not that's fancy i
i think it would have been more fancy if we use the titanium housing the casing it would be
that's the flavour as
it has flavour yes that's right we should tasted
it but that's fancy in the way i mean fancy as a lot of
it has to do with station i so
no it could have been a little bit more innovative you by using the kinetic energy source but it's
so that's due to have free to freeze so
could make it easier
yes so if you want to have a conclusion as three then you wouldn't make a four if you fill

anything else to add or
maybe we should think about these buttons but
but bernie we shouldn't evaluate yet so
that's maybe that's better or maybe you
although i think we eat we could still make a remote control that up applies more too young people
hard is not
at two or three will or will be
three and three may

as it's quite easy
good and the case is it is rubber
plastic or rubber
i if we leave be if we leave this one that's no
my maybe not all that fancy but just way more easy basic and the

one except
by giving it another colour already
we we do have the rubber we do have to colours
six and four six or forest and divided
divided by for us to an off

fancy look and feel so
after all i think personally i would give it to but
we should make it a four it will be three in general
i haven't said anything yet

but then will switch to my presentation
so in that way it is a sense
but that's not what they're talking about i think because
if you ask yourself bit of an features i don't think it is it has all the features and a normal remote have

if you look at be what we could do to make it more to make it just between the twelve euro fifty
just a lot of free
no we are a evaluating this design the spurts out
because he is already he or she is already had sense user so

it's trendy fan
i agree
not many remotes have to solar think
divided by four

at and the voice recognition as that maybe
the voice
the most important function is easy to use the zapping channel switching volume

that's not really important
at my name's not name but
i know maybe we should look

i used here you can be or your document
i really like titanium i'm into it
i know what we didn't talk

should be fancy that's
everything i believe for
i believe it's fancy

but i'm afraid it's not complete because we
big because you can we didn't
we didn't talk about it but

because of the time but i personally give it a one and
and two lost
there are cases in which that outside casing is can be and you know it's mouldable no it's not that one

and for a while they start to develop some skills and the voice recognition functions and
since we're not gonna manufactural anyway

and the colouring
the production costs the costs

yellow with
no wood or grey or black

but these are tasks that are only executed ones i think or not
although by pressing the button for a line don't know two three seconds you would also say it you disable it will it'll beep and they do

i'm a button for and disabling the voice recognition
i'm doubting as

you are name is
so i think it is a this is remote control with a very high level features although there are

i mean it's fancy everything
yes i think we've six to sixty in developing a product that's actually quite good but not for this kind of markets and not for this kind of price so

that's very expensive
i'll change it a make

but that's not what's has been asked
we should take the boards

so it is possible
so it is possible to make it a device that attracts a little bit more too young people

that means redesign
two to three

what they want wants it was course and soft materials so in that way
so in that way it's fancy

not to because if we use a double curved case we could make use solar cell
looking at the user needs we only don't we don't have to double curved case we

and i think it's easy to use for both at types of users
that depends on what you implement in the speech feature

it's the it's overall is the device
is the device easy to use

if it makes a four there are three
seven three no

but i'm saying is three it is it
the content right

is easy to find
i have a veto

it's not about the content
no we haven't read it really worked it out but

i think because we compare all these cursor it's characteristics with a market with the real market so
there are other remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy there are there yes but it's not be

what we didn't talk about is
but that doesn't hasn't it is i'm lisa it's

because a regular programmable remote control contains a really a lot of buttons at least forty buttons so
so it's quite complicated to get to get used to and this is quite

it's the same as a on the top of it with the river the round button but we don't

we don't we do think it's one of the ease of use which prefers to with the customer of the use of force

i think that this device which is a learning curve

novice users you use is device as the normal uses use remote control and for a while

and then they will not use this tile what is often but all the

but all the users when you to this device need something like that then

like that then it needs to understand what's how to change channels and change the volume so

the volume so it's easier for them

good i see the scroll browse as a sort of shortcut

it's it's another approach it's more

approach it's more that are as i still within the home

i still within the home and there are there many ways of doing things or such a device as

they're plastic or rubber

grey or black or something like that whatever cost the cost least

welcome to that later

welcome to that later

you could use to love "'em" to program the other channels on the two channel button "'cause" you have

'cause you have to be assigned to channel and channel

but maybe you do want to programme button to for example activate the voice recognition or train the force voice recognition

there's the basic idea our product that

use thought of some evaluation criteria

and these for the most important criteria

spongy

that's how the fashion going for the state of fancy

just walk through the star burst up i mean it's

i believe it's sensitive

these are the u. k. at the criteria

the costs are not and there right this is d.

it's the way above by law for the twelve euro fifty and what

and what makes it very expensive is for example the solar cell so

so i we should skip that because it's not

that because it's not that important

as the price and the style

the price the number of items and the some

the number of

this is what i would call are a luxury model

then i it the following changes twelve euro forty

twelve euro forty cents i came up with by leaving add solar cells

by not using the voice recognition feature because it's a

because it's a four euro addition to the price

i believe

pushbutton

it makes it thirteen

which buttons are not the most expensive but

most expensive but do at the extra cost so

this design is not within our price model

because we use push this position the special materials last item i have not at

i have not at one item

so it's way too expensive

it's still too expensive

but that's only for the buttons so the

so the button we can use plastic

and the maybe not use a special form

and plastic and just press a button to pass us out of rubber

it becomes a very dull remote control i know but it's

but it's the board decision

when this is our only option we should even consider changing casing because

because i think there's very little added value in advance case with these dole functions so

i know maybe we should look at and focus on other

type of maybe in our market segments

and the maximise the profits and

or maybe you good to we should go for a straight a simple but that's not

boards

although i think

but i agree it's not a fancy high-tech a device definitely not but

it's not that in of the t. v. or however use

or however use pronounce that

too bad

so that means

we do not have that i'm not to redesign the product

but we can evaluate the process and the set section on how things went i'm not

i'm not if we need to evaluate the device first

because if we evaluate we can also determine is our objectives are good so

we'll we can learn

i agree

it applies it

is not the alternates a fancy tool that

think it could pay more fancy by using the double curved case it would've been even more fancy but

fancy but we decided not to because

we do have to colours just

terribly the we're close to

yes i agree it's you the

and now was it instead

with the voice recognition feature and

let's this product

so i think it is i think it's innovative

and the scroll we'll the solar not many

but would've been it's real

is it easy to you

the voice recognition and of course it's hard to learn i think

is not for the the for the elderly

but there are two parts in this remote control what you see here

what you see here is the basic part everybody

the basic part everybody can use it's so that's easy to

so that's easy to use this for novice user

this for novice user when

when you have a more advanced than average user such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions

i think a three wouldn't give it more

it's maybe it's not very easy for

of the more advanced functions are probably it harder

i mean ease of use does not only apply to the most basic functions it's

right and that but i and it says user will find the voice recognition function easy to use

two or three

two or three that

to freeze so that's ten

four and a three together you have the

four

you have the two years or two three and three

but if i would say three and it's six and four is ten divided by four is two point five

if you fill out a four

will so it will be a two point five

but that's not possible to fill in so we

to fill in so we have to round it

it out but you could you can just say find any repeats fine

it most definitely is it's very easy

but that's the basic idea of the speaker

something like that maybe have to program it once so to let you respond to a certain word or a certain sentence something like where are you and then it will saying line here so something like that so i

but even without it

i we should not a state alone on this subject there because of the time but

the feel of remote control is spongy

it can't be more spongy so

it can't be there are cases

was that one of our options

no it's not that one of our option that's

of our option that's when you look in the market when you look

this was the most spongy option

for the options given it's the most point you want

i think in this case we've done the best we could

yes but it's not be enough so it's a two

i a look at take one

you take one when you get

it depends "'cause" it's the most spongy we could have but

i know but you have to maybe if we get a number

because we need to go on and for the time

if i give it a one no we want health calculations was just

give it to and make this a one point five

it my mark will be a four

locate the remote controls enough features

the basic layout doesn't know from all for much but

all for much but voice recognition could at all

it's completely programmable you can add

you can add very much functionality by using the voice recognition on

so it's quite a sense

i'm lisa it's

big

talk about it but you do have remote controls that are able to adapt another signal so

you place it a regular remote control in front of the other one hit the one or the two or the three whatever and it records the series d. c. the signals so you could

to send the signal sentiments

so you could a and to any comments you like as long it's able to as long as our device able to reproduce the infra-red signal

although there are a few buttons but

but the inside is quite advanced

but that's it's power i because a regular

and this is quite simple you can use your

can use your voice to program it's

let's give it a number

let's give it a number

let's give it a number i'll give it a a one for this the type of markets i think it's a one

'cause of with the voice recognition you could add anything you want so

so high quality low acceptance

the product is a high call it has a high quality and this advanced but

but whether or not our clients are willing to pay twenty five euros for this kind of device is that is what is not but do

yes i agree i

maybe even because it doesn't look at phones

maybe we should have a radar function
