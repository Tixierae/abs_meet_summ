a lot so you use a remote control quite frequently while watching television
i wouldn't i already have a remote control with the television and that by one

we don't do we don't need any buttons on the remote control should
pretty my five not too many pretty remote controls that
if they're not gonna just combine your remote control disk looks pretty that actually need as

so that a remote control a lot of functionality but really
there's a breakout how much see the functions are right control power
the big function of remote control is to send messages to another system that is fixed and
we should do we want what are the think of functions for this remote control and they show you the
trying if you would buy remote control i wouldn't i already
that people will buy a new remote control for functionality know buy it you that's remotes i've got friends
and we can include a know controls some new features

and the only twenty six percent said remote controls are bad r. s. i don't know how
it would be solution for when you're remote control is lost i mean when it has
in this but you have the remote control the sender and on the other but the receiver so that's
but tomorrow we might have all wanted to tennessee remote controls are two hermit can have to close one also but
do we included and do we give it a prominent a place on the all the on the remote control sell
saw are our remote control has to be better
because universal remote control so i tend to be a quite expensive
that is a time for the say fifteen to twenty five age group and not may know where she ninety days to be your remote control on

so there are two all kinds of remote if you open only in the house or actually so
you have a standard t. v. remote very hard
v. so is it in be like a switch on the remote that says they use a t. v. you use the v. c. r. or does it not which
i like it was try to make you know that's remote that's
if we're getting it to you know that's remote area true we going to l. c. d. screen to think that which would try out

groups a hundred people disaster that their remote control uses habits and what they want the remote control
eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy
current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user
is that that is fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room so some way of
so some way of that location the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users thirty four percent

and they show you the working design so
that's it for the working design

one thing is doing is talking about speech recognition remote control
speech recognition
the remote control should be it or a bit and speech
and we don't know where the state of the out of speech recognition is maybe you know
this is not talking about if you pay for speech recognition in a remote control would pay more for it
people can have the speech recognition but this is a

are these are the sky and then a common belief on remote controls and market
as i mean but by the market as a cheap and start control we cut bit more much not

and at in this presentation and this quick presentation but is gonna focus on the working design of the remote control and i'd
and the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages right
when i'm amy would be to you designed and choose the chips and the infrared components to beat the remote control i
i hope we're get a clearer view on what the remote controller use in terms of technical components but maybe
problem like a diary has these are the design a remote are out

numbers that it's not you and i need to take into account for our function or
of course we should take that into account and the
because we have to take into account that then on the web and i said fall a lot our for me and so when

but then the keys are more space yes they don't look
it looks for a you don't have too many keys but

seventy five you seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly
seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot so you use a
from that seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five percent
thirty five percent to thirty five to forty five
five for eighty percent for forty five to fifty five and then
fifty five and then i percent fifty five sixty five

which people can press and
younger people like trendy designs so
people would just have or already have to do a pen have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a universal thing of control
i think that when we think it over after i think we are trying to offer be kind of universal control for less money
then we decide on going to is more universal kind of control
given we are going for this universal type

abstract and we could have maybe have come from discussion about it's about the functions and
i went to talk a little bit all of the technical function so
function so what actually it's a board what do the user going to do with them either
in that case it and you lose that the function should be able to pick up there we see are often and do
in that case you want to browse firestone postal you want to have those kind of functionalities
things and you'd need the functionalities what you need in both the l. e. d. or as as in the standard t. v. thing
mean you can go pretty far as i think that which functions and possible feature but
but still it's still people have the i. d. b. c.'s more functional than a normal i see because
