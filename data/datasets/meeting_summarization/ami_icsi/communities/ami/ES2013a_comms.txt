but i also for about them not working or not coordinated new why not working with
new why not working with this one for that this three and then this came over here for another
remote what would be for work and what group
we have to help each other work
each other work through this as a group and i think we

million that's just you do the math
it's four million of "'em"
to be if the p. four million
four million you'd have to sell four million

where the new group to create a new remote control for real reaction
and this remote control has to be sold on where to sell it for twenty five euros with
if the cost twelve and a half year selling it for twenty five you're making twelve and a half euros each
experience with remote control where is the use of remote
is the use of remote control for television or d. v. d. year or something you both
i've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time but i also
it is to that you're always sitting there in your use it and use a flat and you wanna change something that's five different remotes a one for the t. v. they want the video and one for cable and one for however as puppies
as puppies in this as a pigeon this is just for television

with a profit aim alternately of fifty million euros that tells
lot of these would be like a hundred million of form on to make twenty five euros on each one and just make a total profit of fifty million not
not the production is to only cost twelve and a half euros per item
and we're to make a profit of fifty million that's just
i was just wondering if that's the if fifty percent is a normal
that's fifty million euros more to make fifty
more to make fifty million euros and you're only getting twelve and a half inch

the trendiness will probably get looked for some marketing research information from you sarah
you can get it's not a bunny rabbit ideas
a fish that's even easier to look at
but i'm afraid i'd take this cow or it's way alt and the cats looking
and the cats looking at the way he's hiding
to give you pretty good idea where you look at
are there any ideas for the remote what would be
i think one that works pretty good
you know subtitles me is that a lot of buttons i've got no idea what it a three

that tells you something about how many no we have to sell on international scale
you do the math and how many we
and how many we selling
and in your question is how many do we have to sell
yes "'cause" our market is international and your problem
your problem is has to do with marketing of you know you
of you know you gotta know how many are going to be selling to know how they can market you have target and who is that

and when we have twenty minute twenty five minutes trouble

right so you want an animal and these characteristics of that animal you have
you have to be able to recognise what animal it is
any animal i could be a good drawer
the favourite characteristics of three cats the weeks "'cause" i think because they're the easiest
and you are favourite characteristics of that animal
favourite characteristics
we could go for the chip animation

and they had to stay home work in a year when you're doing you know what
that's the show the profit we're talking about one that will work for the home environment for t. v.s and
i think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions like i've got one at home
like i've got one at home the house

electrical the industrial
the industrial design is very good
i think that's the industrial design is the first one that's
the first one that's k. e. d. for the working design and
alright so this is the end of the first meeting thank you all

are all gonna draw a cat
cats are sometimes very independent my parents had
my parents had a cat it's
and i think we all you know we like a kitty cat in a rat in our fish but

so we'll have a functional design individual work both meeting and then conceptual design and detailed design
and user that's use for the technical functions design and for marketing
as it says we're gonna get individual instructions but

this is the kick-off meeting for today
and from we should finish this meeting that like right now one's

be new remote control is to be original trendy and user-friendly that's
that's the feature part is the user-friendliness the originality
