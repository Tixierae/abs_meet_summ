it's recorded
easily it opens up but so it's a very
of course anybody's record it so it's not lost
it's a cat
so ja the finish at a big deal of a project that is to set to
i was not define the top
you can suggest points ladies so
so we have to decide for somebody if you can control or one device comment about
so what's what are your ideas the one that's maybe i can have
maybe i can have to your opinion on from the marketing side
would want lots would buy a remote control from us

and we'll and by your are dispatching the different task you will be you would have to for a few to complete this process
no that wouldn't i've got five thing in front of requirements right now
if you don't have so many buttons be

so you have to be quick
for the loan more project
so the bodies to have other remote controls so

is it for the for picking for a logo know
of before but on the remote control sunset to say then it could be a single device otherwise the program would want lots would
do you agree

so i would first up where is the one where come opening then
easy to monster

and then we move to consider design we specify the different components involved what kind of user and to have interface we want and what are the different the trendy and user interface and like that and
that and then the day do that design we've got fifteen specifically implement seen and it saying the choice we've made in the second point

what is this stains please
pretty

and the beach or it but it
i don't know if it looks like a

excited there
you can roll like are very simplify i

anyways

too many kids and

so welcome everyone so where you

so where you have for the kick-off meeting of the process of designing a new remote control

then or we will us see what will be or project and what will be the difference that we will have to design it

and then we will discuss if we have few eighties and we'll

i just want think a set than five minutes but i have something

s. and so you could ever

i have another meeting so should

you have another things and

controls so twelve and a vintage are completely does we have to be original have to be trendy and we i have to also tried to be user-friendly

so the designs that will be divide it into the main points first

first it would be the functional design

third is the conceptual design and then use the design

and then use the design a design so the version i design

so the version i design is to you don't if i the menus and use the taking of function and the remote control or fruit for a few

so i will know ask you which is very important for the design of the new remote control for to you show us to draw you're for it anymore on the weight

what the more than an idea

you have any idea of which an email you want to show us

that room

a half the same thing one thing about that

if you want to react this would go for drawing the i'll it's you a comment

to not start going on

it's an abstract doing

i think it's and original

you i made my

no that's easily it opens up but

so it's a very important

important

in a three you have to be minging

have to be minging and that

so reach it for

you know it's a cat it's isn't it

i thought these things it not exist

it's as a place that's

place that's a it's a bit so i

it's like cats

the name is

the name is to have made

how many

john f. i knew i

i knew i

think it's useful for the cable s. i.

you know it makes their use of the picture

so it looks like a bond

no it looks more like you don't feed back i would say so

so i all that it's you in the process of these a new remote control

that is to set to have the production cost lower than twelve point five euros and

and i have a selling price of twice that price in a lot to target group of that profit of fifty million euros

is there a market for a new remote control

if it's trendy already than than fulfil the user these

easy to a single device remote control is it and need to decide what can

we have to discuss that point on

that point on

ladies so what so we

so if you'd say that by you'd only you'd rather be from it a pretty

so maybe it should be for multiple devices

and the you have any ideas and off design i. d.s are in the didn't go requirements we should for a few

i think we shouldn't have too many for my i think

few buttons and

and do you have it or so to be like you know to be used in the dark maybe a good idea

maybe a good idea

and you have any any heidi off the train the trend in the door main what it should look like things like that

something which is not it's square we won't be not a box

something that it fits in your hand
