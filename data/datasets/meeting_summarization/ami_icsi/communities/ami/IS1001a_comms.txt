so where you have for the kick-off meeting of the process of designing a new remote control
so i will know ask you which is very important for the design of the new remote control for to you show us to draw you're for it anymore on the weight
so i all that it's you in the process of these a new remote control
is there a market for a new remote control
maybe we can have a something new we sold and the remote controlled beep

so the bodies to have other remote controls so
so the version i design is to you don't if i the menus and use the taking of function and the remote control or fruit for a few
would want lots would buy a remote control from us
and also test you need maybe it's maybe important for the remote control to be to to resist two would buy it shocks that can happen if it for what a professor
have it as we know what a proof remote control so that the people can use it in there but
and that's for the shock i mean there are two pull out how the remote control and that worries that is going to break and it's it's plastic around it that's
was all the time i lose my remote control we should have
but of course would you don't know what you need there any ordeal according on your remote control right
and also we have the market picks up to try to find out what are the absolute requirement with these need eating a remote control for the user

then or we will us see what will be or project and what will be the difference that we will have to design it
and we'll and by your are dispatching the different task you will be you would have to for a few to complete this process
for the loan more project
third is the conceptual design and then use the design
and then use the design a design so the version i design
we have to ask the curve that's the design two d. in the she i dunno designer

easy to a single device remote control is it and need to decide what can
so we have to decide for somebody if you can control or one device comment about
maybe i can have to your opinion on from the marketing side
of before but on the remote control sunset to say then it could be a single device otherwise the program would want lots would

that may be good track two four
option that are said it was it so
so we can are we said a remote cover
we said tracking we said tracking
we said tracking remote control that's a

too many kids and
if you don't have so many buttons be
maybe it is a region and because you can use eating you are in your buttons whereas the of those counts
we should have a special button on the t. v. like we to make the remote control be

and then we will discuss if we have few eighties and we'll
we have to discuss that point on
so i will as the industrial designer to find out more about these industrial design so in you working any working function we have discussed

controls so twelve and a vintage are completely does we have to be original have to be trendy and we i have to also tried to be user-friendly
and then we move to consider design we specify the different components involved what kind of user and to have interface we want and what are the different the trendy and user interface and like that and
if it's trendy already than than fulfil the user these
so then i will ask the user and if i interface designer to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons the fight it just like to you don knotts things like that and what would be convenient for the user

you have any idea of which an email you want to show us
and the you have any ideas and off design i. d.s are in the didn't go requirements we should for a few
and do you have it or so to be like you know to be used in the dark maybe a good idea
that's a good idea very region and that's can
idea but i'm not so double to what you
so double to what you were giving and giving there but it was

so maybe it should be for multiple devices

what a professor there maybe it is a region
maybe what the proof would be very region either

so i would first up where is the one where come opening then
so the designs that will be divide it into the main points first
first it would be the functional design
of course anybody's record it so it's not lost
and i have a selling price of twice that price in a lot to target group of that profit of fifty million euros
that's see we have to we have to have an advantage over our competitors i think is a good advantage

i just want think a set than five minutes but i have something
that is to set to have the production cost lower than twelve point five euros and
no that wouldn't i've got five thing in front of requirements right now

the basic requirement

so it looks like a bond
no it looks more like you don't feed back i would say so
and you have any any heidi off the train the trend in the door main what it should look like things like that
you to look at blocking the case
about bats and look at or maybe because you will receive a some good advice soon
