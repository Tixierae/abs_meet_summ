two hands so
it's between one and seven
seven yes the i would give
and you do you want the christine
maybe we would have to agree on come on
i don't know i think six
i think six it's a good to

you can have many project team
i have a scale of seven points so
that's seven of them
do you want the christine the yet so
the yet so

i think i would use or five
so we have for four and five
we can put for everyone

it's ease of that
hi you

last time that is to say to have some battery to have
double including the voice i will be in a look within

you have a presentation on
and you made and maybe edition and the

i you i give it a five
so it's between one and seven

do you do the side
five point five average

so the notes
the notes the grade we have five six for me five

i give a seven i think
i would use a or give a seven is when it's very easy

sports is for the material should be sent to destroy

should be sent to destroy disparate side need it really looks like

it really looks like a banner

it didn't matter

hi you so

so at your far the detailed design meeting

we will we'll first present

we'll first present but we are going to do in this meeting

then i will also take

i will also take notes doing this meeting and i was

meeting and i was saying you a summary then as usual we will

we will begin look at the evaluation could tear out of the prototype presentation by here or two colleagues that make you

that make you could work and

and then we will see their financial aspects and the cost of the product and then

and then we'll a evaluate the product

and with the conclusion of this project and see whether it feeds we isn't it for if you use it for a few the requirement on that

let's start with the cost aspects so

aspects so why a look at

why a look at the spec discussed last time that

have a you'll banana shaped case we is the rubber mat a all round it to be

to feel spongy

and the doors so the different aspects like having a wee you know except for and

and the cost and you to be ten point seven year olds so

because we have the price gap of twelve point five euros

all four and the financial aspect it's we can

we can we can continue was these products as if and we

and we all know going to see the project evaluation with or marketing expert

and the addition to taste made according to the use of the requirements and the market trends we talked about the rings the previous meetings so

so you can do two hands

that we have six parts we

we talked about before so we want

so we want rather put it fancy look and feel technology coding let's see if easy to use fish and it's easy to find the room and robust and

and i have a scale

and according to what you think about the this project you can make a one point two point of seven points and

and after we have an average and we see

sort of a fancy look and

of a fancy look and see what do you think between

maybe you can present

i would give a six

would be that would be easy

no problem so this

he's i don't know if it we we have to put it enough if it's that are all

let's say that seven is the best

maybe we can save it and that's

and what was your choice all much would you deal

six

all much would you deal and the fanciest it and station amount of thing

how much would you don't answer

you don't answer to use question

so a flat one side of it

so after that ignore as you can respect

take me it you know if you got aspect

we say the we have a new technological a single these are we in

not so the rubber that so

which makes it like new word so i think i would use

for some "'cause" it except

'cause it except that we've we don't have so much innovation the rubber

the rubber is

be in a look within the voice and you wouldn't know no

for let's put four

for twenty five

everyone is all

is all four point

we easy to use to think is it's easy to use

i've seen so i would use a

is when it's very easy to use

sixth for me a four

six point five
