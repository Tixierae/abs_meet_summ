because we have the price gap of twelve point five euros
the notes the grade we have five six for me five
five point five average
six point five
so six point five
six o. five

and according to what you think about the this project you can make a one point two point of seven points and
so we have for four and five
is all four point
sixth for me a four
it's very according to the work of four to design it the

so we want rather put it fancy look and feel technology coding let's see if easy to use fish and it's easy to find the room and robust and
we easy to use to think is it's easy to use
i would use a or give a seven is when it's very easy
easy to find you know room
six easy but
i think we do have a room but be a project in this time around a much bigger salary as

i have a scale of seven points so
it's between one and seven
let's say that seven is the best
is it station seven
it's it's fruits fruit shape i would say seven

and the cost and you to be ten point seven year olds so
that we have six parts we
so you say six months
nobody it's a case six
six years
so attain a fancy twenty six can try and set it to us it's a six and so that's
the data and when the six that would it's a good at predicting think

for twenty five
so i think this at twenty four euros is quite attractive i think
and so we could say that twenty five euros energy
five euros energy make profit

it really looks like a banner
aspects so why a look at
why a look at the spec discussed last time that
and the doors so the different aspects like having a wee you know except for and
sort of a fancy look and
of a fancy look and see what do you think between
take me it you know if you got aspect
double including the voice i will be in a look within
be in a look within the voice and you wouldn't know no

and then we will see their financial aspects and the cost of the product and then
and then we'll a evaluate the product
let's start with the cost aspects so
all four and the financial aspect it's we can
we can we can continue was these products as if and we
the financial aspect where we
we have the costs you or threshold and

have a you'll banana shaped case we is the rubber mat a all round it to be
'cause it except that we've we don't have so much innovation the rubber
it's rubber made of rubber i think it's an
but you'd is a it is surrounded by rubber i dunno so maybe

we will we'll first present
we'll first present but we are going to do in this meeting
we will begin look at the evaluation could tear out of the prototype presentation by here or two colleagues that make you
and we all know going to see the project evaluation with or marketing expert
we have seen the prototype it's
the evaluation give so exciting results as so i think we can

so at your far the detailed design meeting
i will also take notes doing this meeting and i was
meeting and i was saying you a summary then as usual we will
and with the conclusion of this project and see whether it feeds we isn't it for if you use it for a few the requirement on that
and you made and maybe edition and the
and the addition to taste made according to the use of the requirements and the market trends we talked about the rings the previous meetings so
so i think we can move to the last part of the meeting
i dunno if it's for like that idea later meeting so
it depends on the watch this meeting we don't know

the coast these is in the project be very chinese
so see you for a next successful were projects

you can have many project team
i think it's an mean it's more or less than or their remote control
can i just have a team they read
team they read it would do it for the t. v.

to make the on the island a spot and so
island a spot and so it's a lights up completely so
the worst so i think i know some for some to make it and it used to find it euros
so i think we can open champagne and
champagne and make your spots used i dunno if

'cause i saw a some for not aware about shaped a wireless phones not more but one for the house and
but on what's what the complexity between the phone and the remote control is not cannot control
