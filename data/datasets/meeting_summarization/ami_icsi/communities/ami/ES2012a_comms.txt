i don't know i mean do you think is a receive it doesn't look at remote control there are people when
there are people when the seasons remote control
because people so taken for granted and then is your remote control

and i'll just be i presenting about the printer working somewhere a little remote control and
we want to do the remote control needs to be original has
as we all know remote controls combine very user unfriendly so
that's something that my not only do the remote control but
or any videos strong feelings about remote controls have the bad
and twist your remote control to get the t. v. to actually pick up the signal
a copy of any other remote controls that are no but i see a laptop at all do we
and then is your remote control breaks it's godspeed you get to get up and mainly change the channel it just
most i think most of the remote controls now retired it's black or grey is a member should go

but briefly this is what we want to do the remote

any other thoughts right so the physical appearance of remote controls
enter any thoughts on it so how much mark it's in changeable fronts on the remote control

and half so that as soon as people say i think a yes that's different how one
i think i find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and that adds
but that it's easy to see if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons
like in a year that's put all the different today
buttons so maybe difference
a member should go with something different are be able
different are be able to i was just thinking
so people can get different things
you get like different you know scenes from movies and on the remote control and sorta

and stable quickly and since i mean what contribution you looking to make so i'm andrew
they look and then it has animals and how
euro already so we're looking at saving a lot of these that the costly in top a and we're looking
and we're looking at the price profit of fifty percent a
so we're not any looking at a very trendy original product we're looking at making
some that looks likes does look like remote control to some
to some looks like so i recycle was this like
some propose experience wish to look but
they got thirty minutes to start looking at the for the design more detail

would it be lights got to use it's just a bind together but so quickly resolve of current remote controls

interface and in case would be the industrial design
i'm katie can the industrial designer
the industrial designer and i'll just be
the industrial design so

so we want to make our as one that people can pick up and think yes that's
would have to pick up a whole market sixties where you got
but and maybe thinking that it's "'cause" the nature of the device maybe a second thing a second can pick the market you facials for your to your might go about this tree since it's a kind

to so that lost and never find again
from the my so you could have lost a remote as
lost a remote as the peace plastic with the big rubber buttons cicada that which you press

and you can see which buttons are supposed to years now
any thoughts about the buttons all and you all the way of approaching me that the the problem
many calls of them buttons all flat screens or more
could be all be flats and the buttons
far from the button the buttons easily
it's a matter of thing at the same more concrete buttons so
but some of the side which i'm gonna button or both

we can change the face plates or have kind of arabia
or have kind of arabia so people can

that can have a look how they want to do different colours things like that probably
we could do the markets together you by your control in said colour or
colour or what if what you buy it with several

be original has be something it makes it that's of the remote controls and half so
we want to making a pro profit for the company a fifty million euro already so we're
we're looking at making it's a very good price
very like i'm making a stylish
making a stylish control would be a very like
like this pen doesn't really like a pen makes you think
a pen makes you think so

but this means you haven't "'cause" any preconceived ideas so
kind of anywhere you should have to like control yourself and twist your
to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just as big rectangular things and that kind
i think it's a remote controls are kind of a unique idea "'cause" it's you depend on
actually it they just need to be very dependable because people
it needs to be very effective a always dependable i don't think
dependable and have said that the average size
i think we've got some a good idea in a row we
and try to get some of these ideas so more for months
