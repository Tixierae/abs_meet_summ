patrol and i'll be a blessing information statistics on what people want to get from the scene design hope you want to
very quickly and this at the want to make
and then we don't want to be constrained by no convention alright slides on screens all anything else
and this is very quickly do what it says and i know and the problem slide here
your favourite animal
and we're looking at the price profit of fifty percent a
or any videos strong feelings about remote controls have the bad
very boring very plain think
very like i'm making a stylish
things and that kind of awkward hold onto so something that's more comfortable
buttons so maybe difference
like a mobile phone
you can a certain entity had any
just keep you care what is the point he would have to
would have to pick up a whole market sixties where you got
sixties where you got one word it appeals to people don't want to have the need device it looks it's fashionable and
he just it's a car is one mother wrote a want rather than a kind of a neat which is with but
but that make for kids
that make for kids and that's what the device four buttons nations and you may not like respond to have a device that they just looks if we want
so we could practical same time i
i this grass appeal to people that wants a device that can enhance are living room
as press the sense so
but some of the side which i'm gonna button or both
the industrial design so
'cause it's you depend on them so much but you don't
but a computer can break down you can like go off
and off the voice complex things going on timit
sons we get massive actually it they just

but this means you haven't "'cause" any preconceived ideas so
the industrial designer and i'll just be
and i'll just be i presenting about the printer working somewhere a little remote control and
control and
resize what about the what they want to say and then we don't want
be original has be something it makes it that's of the remote controls and half so
make mobile phones and t. v. remotes i think
i think t. v. remotes
and so what we need to keep in mind here that the we won't sell this for twenty five euro you know we
we want to making a pro profit for the company a fifty million euro already so we're
i think i find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and that adds
and you can see which buttons are supposed to years now
any thoughts about the buttons all and you all the way of approaching me that the the problem
have the bad ones of use of good
to so that lost and never find again
easily there's one step ahead of the cup competition
to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just as big rectangular things and that kind
far from the button the buttons easily
do we need it to
million i think that if we market this is not has not just
you can like go off and off the voice complex

that the table and really marketing and you
and you can draw with the and design they be the user interface and in
room or on the market research person for this this meeting is project for creating this you will patrol and
design hope you want to have the like and that a fashion point here and about the company
i'm can draw and
of thing before that time sell be
sell be working on the design
on a user friendly as we all know
which maybe all sorts of shapes in the shops instance
lost a remote as the peace plastic with the big rubber buttons cicada that which you press
i mean the thing is if you're watching television in a docking ring the you need to be able to
but so souls or
this or sooner which are working on think of them as a car

that's a good price for the consumer and that's a good price for the company
we want to do the remote control needs to be original has
as a button wants mixing in the
i i had i like the way they look and then it has
they look and then it has animals and how

i think he missed p. and because of their
like this pen doesn't really like a pen makes you think
there are people when the seasons remote control
i think something that's comfortable to hold because
and the buttons are very can also at all but

and they do and just user interface designer and i
it needs to be very effective a always dependable i don't think
i don't think we should make it too small "'cause" i think it
small "'cause" i think it needs to it

abandon cells in fact we would do that by pointing and stable quickly and
a pen makes you think so
residual my spongy it could be all be flats

the that the work to be done is it the the functional design what it's what it was actually do the
the conceptual design we actually present that's the consumer
suppose it's up to marketing to make people aware of the product

so that's not acting
not acting as whiteboard a so we'll
would it be lights got to use it's just a bind together but so quickly resolve of current remote controls

with the thing that in immediately comes to mind is computer mouse as which
and have some propose experience
actually it they just need to be very dependable because people

in and we want to make this the very best product that's possible for everybody whatever
not so i've got a favourite animal to be quite honest i think

interface and in case would be the industrial design
what's that they project is easy to use this to get this project of the meeting at everybody uses

at everybody uses free to say or what are they want
to be has a contribution to make and

as we all know remote controls combine very user unfriendly so
so we want to make our as one that people can pick up and think yes that's

and we may become need money by producing what the consumer wants
but that's just give and take a ball your favourite animal

the consumer and that the detailed design it is how we get that into production
the main design so what we have to be able to those alignments is the whiteboard and

sources no particular
no particular reason why

so we're not any looking at a very trendy original product we're looking at making
we're looking at making it's a very good price

but that it's easy to see if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons
so i think it is best and they're clearly labelled and you can see which

ones of use of good ones that used to
i think it's important you should be able to when you press the buttons are actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere you should have

the court and from us to come with t. v. provision that's a t. v.s in t. v. there's maybe aren't
like in a year that's put all the different today

some that looks likes does look like remote control to some
could be all be flats and the buttons

down so you could feel
so it's a matter of thing at

welcome to be the first meeting real reactions development meetings for a new television remote control this for those are

this for those are very successful intrinsically you can see the market so the last you're will save and

save and which we wanted to build on taking

build on taking advantage of the the latest developments in technology and they the latest my feelings in consumer design and and in and

and then to that end we needles work together to do that

do that and that in a particular older "'cause" but everybody is just as vital to this projects

i'll just give "'em" that the table and

that far but that welcome anybody to say something we if we abandon cells in fact

and stable quickly and since i mean what contribution you looking to make so i'm andrew

so i'm andrew

you sound room or on the

i haven't had a whole lot of experience and that's kind of thing before that

right and this to open

and this to open to being creative

i'm katie can the industrial designer

at the want to make this meeting to structured "'cause" the

structured "'cause" the whole idea is that it's a them i think tank resize

but briefly this is what we want to do the remote

and half so that as soon as people say i think a yes that's different how one

and that goes along with being trendy and it they are want it seen on a user friendly

and think yes that's it's obvious how that works and

and they also what took the price and think that's something that my

that's something that my not only do the remote control but

control but it's such a one gonna have

a one gonna have on and last

and last but not least all first of all they must make the company money and

and how suggestible everybody had time to install some they're the ones that we didn't do that

so we'll we do a virtual drawing on the on the whiteboard of you'll and i think the animal but that's just give

it's contrast up on the way in there but i feel like the underdog

i feel like the underdog kind of status and

no not my wife's is gonna be able to about as often as a button wants

probably it back i

and how they can fly or swimmer walk around or whatever

or in a fair enough fair i'm not so i've got a favourite

because of their a probability to

and a dash so that they yes that's

euro already so we're looking at saving a lot of these that the costly in top a and we're looking

a cost twelve euros fifty to make

would it be lights got

buttons and that adds handy is when you have one that works both the d. v. d. player or whatever and the t. v. as but

kind of anywhere you should have to like control yourself and twist your

and twist your remote control to get the t. v. to actually pick up the signal

making a stylish control would be a very like

so what did what particular style features so you think about it

to some looks like so i recycle was this like

i don't know i mean do you think is a receive it doesn't look at remote control there are people when

any other thoughts right so the physical appearance of remote controls

so something that's more comfortable bit

bit sits on a person's hand better

the shops instance quite fancy ones

some propose experience wish to look but

but particularly comfortable

many calls of them buttons all flat screens or more

from the my so you could have lost a remote as

that which you press residual

at all but instead of being grey state of the device but you push into device is like a mouse but

easily

maybe they could be concave sort of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel

it's a matter of thing at the same more concrete buttons so

a copy of any other remote controls that are no but i see a laptop at all do we

entity had any thoughts it's the parents how we might markets something which they're

which they're already millions and that we want to

and that we want to we have to take over the entire point it's with

especially try to sell two million from

room and also a device that

what i think any any prices that we identify we need to aim for all off

but so souls

i think it's a remote controls are kind of a unique idea "'cause" it's you depend on

them so much but you don't i it's this or sooner which

because people so taken for granted and then is your remote control

and then is your remote control breaks it's godspeed you get to get up and mainly change the channel it just
