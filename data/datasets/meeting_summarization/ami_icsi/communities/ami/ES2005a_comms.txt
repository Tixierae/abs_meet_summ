concerning about that i five euros us about and fifteen times or so
and you can whistle you know there's things
because we always lose a remote control
being as a marketing expert and then like to say like or before deciding the cost of this remote control or the end of the things we must see the market potential for this product like
then you do you say kind

so presumably that might be an idea to
and as you say we need to have some kind of gimmick so

so that the key rings
an hour so we

kind of maybe more like a p. d. a. kind of just hand helds like
that would cover known in half an hour so

and making a profit of fifty million euros so

so it's got it gonna have to be pretty damn trendy

only dollar remote controls i've used you should come with the television

a fairly basic so

i was thinking that as i think that the only ones i've seen but you buy are the sort of one for all type things for their

the universal one

but to sell at twenty five you wanna need features

and that's quite a lot for remote control

my first source would be

first source would be remote controls are grey or black or this or the come with

black or this or the come with a t. v. set some

a t. v. set some h. two basic right back remote controls those functions they made could

they made could think about colour make that might

make that might make it bit different from the rest at least

so i thought may be something like if you lose it and you can whistle you know

like what is the competition in the market were

in the market were to have the available prices of the remote controls in the prices white

white space or do our own remote controls are having and how

and how complicated it is to use this remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market so

so before desire to go before file as in this project we must discuss all these things like

an apart from these you should be having a good look also was people

was people really like a like to play with it then they are watching movies are playing with them you know or playing with the l. c. d. player them be to do it like any electronic devices they really

they really want to have something good having a good design in their hands so

so we're looking for

we're looking for

within a good size would be for this

'cause i know it is that more buttons the remote sometimes it's so big in clunky was just like a hundred

was just like a hundred buttons on it or it could have a really

or it could have a really small slim one but they could lose it easily

for remember trying to

remember trying to make it for twelve euros fifty

far as making of the screen or like here but

we should all look into a bit

and a light signal so
