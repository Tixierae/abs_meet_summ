other hand or even i mean
even i mean there's a whole variety and
you wanna press enter for ten or chart to them
like the lightning the
but the middle button on the on screen menu function of the power button
it would make it hard to turn the machine of the time t. v. off
would it be a very difficult to just have an external device that like i dunno
"'cause" that's not a very bright it so you read the
but these be used for going submenus
just my opinion
i think it's kind of main do we do
bag i
i'm a i'm give it a one the main know
that's the bus or should be there i i'd
i'm also we talked earlier about r. s. i. and windy for and a sort of like carpal tunnel a kind of thing
we think that the latex sort of crap appropriately take that into account
because older people that are used like texting the thumb might find it a bit at first but
i think it's probably a little harder than most remotes to learn because
to learn because you have to use the menu system then you have to
the cost than the budget to the project evaluated

and i wonder if it's more just a gimmick than anything else
there might be something that you can do in the circuit board in the chip to make it make a noise or something but it would
or something but it would take a lot more development then we have this afternoon
and right in colours and
show and seven being not true at all or false if the
so like in my opinion but if we're now at least the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so i'm gonna
not so much "'cause" we need on the l. c. d. screen we don't
other than what it looks like i don't know if it's really
the kinetic battery
i'd say is technologically it's not it's not unique i mean
it give it a four tera that's a pretty high learning curve it'll be easy once you've
the buttons and special colour special
no maybe not i don't know what just happened
and we've just about gossip within the cost
saying that they made sense chairs are like they

it's approximately fifteen fourteen or something like that
two three buttons for adjusting the volume saved
it's like a formed for it right
i'll say two as because older
son and the user wary net
net i know you're saying you're a little bit nervous about that i don't know it's a remind
and that could take a better than that fast that
so i give it a four
one electronics

we can use a scroll which is in a latex
we have the on off button at the chip very visible very big we have are
the volume saved up volume up and volume down on the other side
that would be one of your channels said like channels
some i mean one and an axe if
i mean one and an axe if it's technologically innovative
bag i
project process that section with for example the room for creativity leadership teamwork means any new ideas found so i what
turning of a good point that i could there were

phone or you can push somebody or index finger for other hand or
and so that's it has to that later
have a little like beep goes off i think
just "'cause" it's like comparable and like an hour different i sort of
why it just it's like a small but still sort of like queue but dean i don't know
'cause i must be like matter what you do something's gonna happen and
and what the best good

and then to choose what colours want to make the buttons and if you
have that in between them or you can see a year kind of back and find it but
separate from the n. c. like that sort of thing
just i would say it's a ratty hands
i don't know what the set of the basic colours though
they're all kind of just push button right
no i think they're fine material

i would have here but we talked
but we talked about energy we're gonna
but on that is that really do your local
gonna put a lot of features that would make it really
hand if it's made of latex the rubber i it's funny otherwise
what if it bounces when you drop it

pretty excited let's start
i am worried about like using the menu
as long as we have that in mind as for designing it's o. k.
we can do this one first i wanna know if
like we'll have yellow and black is that two

and finally it to production evaluation and close
and then finally we have the martian or the pay or you know way
up with it could stand up like this on your table if you want it to if i made about the bottom flat
case material is rubber and it's
i don't think anybody dominated it with that i

the bomb this
to run this
have not the sense that it's an ergonomic
channel up and channel down and that it's
so for trying to do something sort of like new and find even know this

shape so that it fits in your hands nicely
but i don't know how much any of this has to do with the fashionable sort of looking thing that we
thing that we also need to focus on
and the case
twelve point five hey

but once a for a changing channels channel
me with the last contrast on it or something
i kind of think it's unique and i thought i'd give it a one or so
i don't know if that's gonna be a later one then i'm
maybe the r. will be in colours so you

normally we go with for fruity colours but maybe
we just keep buy them no we
so you know interface
we have sex
sex with the power

i'm not quite how it would work and i wonder
so i'll give it a tail
you can get information
'kay we work at this as a bag or it should have
cat a while and

need that so we'll just go through the moment i meant
if we have a yellow
hopefully not with just one thing you know some point but
battery "'cause" you're always moving your rest
closing

it's functional is also a pretty basic so i'll give it
it's kinetic battery that's kind of expensive but we have a sample chip
but we have a sample chip single curve
like that have been yes and it just been so conscious of like turning the pages are no the bit of a distraction and that was the last one
that was the last one like a chosen not to do a powerpoint saying that they made sense

corporate colour we didn't keep that and
it a one the main know can put be over
and if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons or you're constantly push and
i like outfits in the hand though so
the menu system and the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing but i think it's one

which is in a latex cases win fruity colours that's curved and
i dunno the video "'cause" i must
that's fine "'cause" it
it does anyone have any other features that they think we're important that we didn't talk about

right we made three different prototypes and
we have are up and down buttons which are also gonna
it's possible
why don't we do a product evaluation using the criteria if you don't send

in terms of making
and so how'd you get back to the main menu
what are the ipod for example you just every time you wanna go back in the menu button again it brings you
that he wants and you press you testified button

v. that when you press it you have a little like beep
no i actually don't have like a power point in time because
button again it brings you back one model
not unique i mean it's just it's it is just push buttons so that give

it be harder to break hard to lose
arse or at the interaction look and
sports the user simple and design you know
i think overall "'cause" we it said before are two main things are simplicity in fashion and so those are the mexicans

height in it the main go come on
i mean how fashionable can you make a remote i think it's pretty
in each buttons
that if we're able to you know user creativity with the information

a later whatever you want
what are you just change it
folder so you know
chairs are like they have the option to do that and just take my own notes and whole sort of thing

the war have the prototype presentation in
in a look at the evaluation criteria look at the finances
i think it's actually functional many give it a one

so starting off with last the last one i would have here
look and so and i'm not good at
i have an excel sheet they were actually gonna calculate the costs

and i we'll start with this one
we have our colours not are not text but this is the general
i don't have any a number and c. and

we have the five preset c. d.
and then you have all the sides take a little bit more three-dimensional you
get them the homing no idea screen you know i mean

it or something still little bright to make it hard to lose but
but we don't want it to look like a good story
seven just about

i dunno if you picked up your email but that
but that the feature that we considered for not getting lost
is pretty kind of a

but do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality
'cause we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off so then we wouldn't
so then we wouldn't have to handle function

it makes a lot more free to use the
it to have that kind of like
pens the white board

is that where people are willing than the potato i
i like the idea of the i mean that's
years or depends how tidy where normally

or is this one's the but the menu and the select button
so they're used to going into an outsider submenus
i mean x. wanna see if it has a spongy quality hand

that you got innovative i dunno i'll give
hard to lose
i think they are the costs under twelve fifty euro

remember really we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons that they use
that they use the channel for being the volume the most
i think we really take that into a lot so many of one

how much how there's the address just being simple
rubber and it's special colour but that's important
how to get more expensive what are you just change

so each unit warm we have one colour on there but the cases
i think we all made it on there is a blessing contributions i don't think anybody
it should have that somewhere on the packaging

and we using pushbuttons and with the supplement of an onscreen menu
they're gonna go with the four as

it's you hold it
really interesting and then we have a market for it so if we can produce the twelve point three which we hope

which are also gonna be a channel selector "'s" and we have our little menu
to give it a four

buttons you for breast slept three times in the menu with the other features and power possibly also with your t. v. channel choices shows up and you have your five
me i have to like write down on the whiteboard so

that's our number one prototype
which one are we sort of roughly looking at two drafts whether or not it needs r.s necessity is yellow we one

or chart to them are should
but double curved

the lightning bolt or not very cute
we call that one the long box

of the run this on that
this one's known as the potato it's

it's a i have not the sense that
get everything done i think it might be a little confusing at first

it's an ergonomic shape so that
i mean how many times do you really use your remote control would

and that it's it's between your favourite channels that you've selected this middle
and we're having one per

said like channels or that would be to switch machine off
what i'll do whatever and numbers

you know way it's a bit different just a little bit more of a creative feel are you have the on
we need to do is in the

but maybe were also thinking that you should of middle aged me and for example customer might not want a free coloured remote so
we're all set

it's gonna be somewhere that you can be seen so we're not thinking
i know i'm really get them the homing

that like i dunno you tape to your t. v. that
like fancy

because if you're remotes lost it's probably on diversity and in
and in that case you can't send an infrared think a signal to that to find it

we so we that we've decided not to worry about that for now
but we know they were really street however so

if you like this as simple and to sort of worrying is that so for trying to do
i think it'll get everything done i think it

find even know this is like your initial i'm initially trying to do just "'cause"
if you don't send me

maybe a little smaller than that
more confusing but if we had all the buttons in black and a designing and the outside and yellow that we're corpora wanna know we

wake it but it's hard to press
buttons are also so the case

back to do what kind of like just
six buttons we have to have sex buttons

i mean that's really got and the simplicity of the buttons down that one
i am worried

you put in menus or submenus and so how'd you
like the buttons

this is disk the up and down
and the zoom in on that

maybe it can be one of those if you press down and hold
she said on

is in the things we've talked about before we need to make that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to do so
the how we work together as a team the digital

range each of the findings in and all
in and all that happy in average just to make

just to make that you don't need that so we'll just
and the next is that the integrate some notion of fruit and vegetable votes i if

in each of you can tell me on a scale of one side then with
like the r. that's gonna be etched in

i don't know fancy as the word i would use
but then the buttons will be in special colours

i'd say two because unique
what about a one pretty hard to mess

of batteries that one so
the digital pens the white

to make it would notice that though
and if it's made of like latex that whole idea that's pretty all

it is that you got innovative i
i think we've been successful in that we

dunno i'll give it a three
and out and buy and more market research of them and threatened that shortly we could've taken that into account

they could it be harder to break
i don't know it's a remind me of the ipod i just got my

so be less than that mean
it's gonna be hard and if it's repetitive

we might wanna keep it yellow
but i think it's one of those things that m. i. t. five minutes to figure out but you'll have it afterwards so i

i know would make it a little less could a little more confusing but if
pretty self ready

and do we have like an are inscribed on the bottom or something or
per unit

it'll be easy once you've done it but
also earlier we at something about losing and so now or not

back and find it but anywhere also it's gonna stand out
i'd say i'd give it a three years or depends how

'cause it would be easy to do something like that
and does it need are like demographic need to sort of for international appeal that whole thing

simple so i'm gonna give it a two
a bunch of our

we didn't address the fact that it does need to have a corporate logo so let's
i think all of them should have an hour

so we could do that with this first
that's all for "'em" they're all kind of just

hand
hand dynamo

electronics
single simple

very curvy so
then i did get a picture of those so i don't really know

we've more than one special colour
we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours

is that two special colours
at the end of that would be under your ears

or is white and black then two more or
i the three

three
i don't know what just happened that's twelve

could have up to three i mean the buttons could each
colours as far as design there so

i mean the buttons could each could be up to three colours as
that's material

thirteen point seven
let's have our buttons all be one colour

it on the numbers and a thirteen point three anyway
we have no idea

so i what we're gonna talk about here it is it just evaluating how we create this project information
create this project information we got a menus how we use that if

painter it making the prototype
in that we chief almost all of the design else that we set ourselves and we've come

but it's gonna use we'll look at it
what did we find and new ideas people

of thing sticky and for the design of that one
new ideas

and you know they existed
i could get watches that had like really quite expensive watches that as an ever need a

and who are detailed design meeting in pretty excited

it and that we're gonna do when opening and then

and then i'll talk about the minutes from last meeting what we just discussed the war

look at the finances and finally

and close

about energy we're gonna use the kinetic battery we want to use

we want to use a simple chip because

a simple chip because right gonna need a dash of all we can use a

it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons including five research and it's

let's do the look-and-feel design presentation first

but this is the general shape it's

you hold it sort of you they're like this in your left it or you switch it over

and see easily adaptable to either hand you can push the buttons with

you can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push

we like this and so what you're saying index finger

's and we have our little menu button here if you push

if you push it if you're just pushing is normally they're the many buttons if you the volume buttons rather if you press

buttons rather if you press all at once they become channel changing buttons you

and you have your five be sets down here

and people wanna grab hold of that see how it feels

that see how it feels in your

it's designs to be used even in your left hand or on your right hand

i've done it just just the four buttons on this one a

this middle button it brings up down screen menu and money

and money working on screen menu use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button how to select

your turn it off

if you press and held it may be

that a one way of doing it that work

colour down or be no

no that's possible

are you have the on off toggles damn on the top we have the five

more three-dimensional you have your channel changing volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle

that's for your consideration as plus it's an interesting

plus it's an interesting talking to to have standing up with it

so i would say a one another one for that

the menu select button

very interesting i

i think that it's brit

so that's three prototypes

in terms of making decisions what we need to do is first of all decide on the form which are the three different shapes to wants then

wants then decide what kind of button they'll we want to how many buttons

and if you wanna play any text on the device like labels on the buttons all the product and name or like a one or whatever

so maybe we'd have one version that's a bit torn down me with the with

that was one thing that we brought up over email i dunno if you picked up your email

right we were talking about that a little bit when we got

a little bit when we got that email and

and we think that each of these are so distinctive that it's not just like another be the technology around your house it's gonna be somewhere

so we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the last

but i don't know covers are gonna charge you still can't

i think that would be conceptually possible

i think it would be difficult technologically because

control would with the device like that actually help you to find

that's all they're evaluation getting more or less

getting more or less we

bright it so you read the gonna stick out that

but i also like that aside buttons on that one like i think that's kind of me

that was i was a little vague

i was a little vague on what exactly just to do but the

or just write on the whiteboard

because i think it would be redundant

to have like a joystick kind of thing you know

it could have a family back to do what kind of like

i don't solve the gatekeeper grip to "'cause"

grip to "'cause" it doesn't ring finger the

but that has a menu button separate from selects button or is this one's the but

the up and down buttons are used the scrolling up and down for a list of justice you find the choice

you find the choice that he wants and you press

if you press down and hold

or two seconds then it brings you back one model or something

yellow we one is that

but you know i really need where's the potato

we can have a see change it after we go through this for one so

we sorta wanna do with each need to separately

go through the moment i meant was go around in each of you can tell

one side then with one being really extremely show and

if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria so

first i wanna know if it needs that the and the look and feel object

in the middle so i'm gonna say it's like if the rate that's just my opinion

what is mutually

give it a number

a number

it's creative

it's creative i don't know fancy

because unique

to our house and

our house and r. i. and

r. i. and same sort of scale for functionality is a functional i think it's

many give it a one

i think it's functional is

functional

did you do the functional

is it technologically innovative

c. d. screen we don't have a teacher up other than what it looks like

the battery that's it

really do your local i have never change the battery

just material

like fancy versus creative it's different it is

so that give it a four

i really like the kinetic battery to

next is it easy to use just

to use just say you know easy to one will be separate sit on

sit on overlapped i think

i think it's really easy is i'll give it

if they gonna be yellow

be that's our corporate colours in there

that's right corporate colour we didn't

we're corpora wanna know we could also have alternative colours one a more conservative one that's more fruity

no the thing about this silvery kind of way or something

it was inspired by the tail so i think

so i think it's really fruity

my name is i

rate and the design it match that appropriate dave remember really we discussed

lot so many of one

and i'm not good at learning technology for the video

for the video

then you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take

one see once you've learnt how to use it i think is a lot easier so i give it a four

i think it give it a four tera that's

so now or not addressing that at all so

where we i think we can kind of say we address the wood colour but

in terms of not losing i do think that on a scale of one to seven and how easy or hard was it two blues i'm

i'm a i'm gonna give it a four "'cause" i think

a four "'cause" i think that you can still have that in between them or you

hey we also said simplicity how much how there's

and so those are the mexicans are not a separate

it like once we simple but it's not like simple so i'm gonna

give it a three i

alright and fashionable

stalin fashionable like

i think it's pretty in technology in fashion to get the real really

i don't know i don't think it's quite as fashionable spiro one remote

i do like the lamar someone

but i will so just keep

if we offer in an in at least three different colour arrangements

logo so let's make we keep that in mind that we had that one of our colour just concept is corporate and has the r. on a bunch of our

or out of finances i have

i'm a bit one more space and the zoom in on

we using kinetic battery right

when using kinetic

simple rather

it's double curved is pretty

our case material supplements we just

as a menu plastic and

no we either plastic is the plastic for the inside it is assumed the

assumed the supplement it is

i it was rubber rather than later

as rubber and special colour a

so it's a three

what are we talking about on each colour combination or we

combination or we know what

what to say three

were doing pushbuttons and how

and how many buttons do we have

we've got five and then on a six

so the case material we just have one colour right

it does it but if we're making multiple

but if we're making multiple varieties of this is what i'm getting confused

were saying per unit

per unit

but the cases

material we want the rubber as probably

to do per button to a

that if there are gonna be rubber it then it that's what it matters

i think that would do it on the numbers and a thirteen

are we this is double

are we this is double curved maybe it's

curved maybe it's single curved with it

i dunno i didn't get any pictures

what's not yet it's kinetic battery that's

but that's important six buttons

that is important to how to

it was their t. n. o. it's fifteen

n. o. it's fifteen

what was that target price again

i say that you are are the shared folder so you know

back to agenda

fifty euro it's sort of on to the project

sort of on to the project evaluation

i thought very creative painter it

and we've come up with the finished product and we've just

i think we could've done even better with a little bit more information like what's

like what's a single curved case how

a single curved case how many colours what the colours

what the colours cow

things but given what we have i think we did really

i think we work together pretty

but the fruit and vegetables in really good like creativity so

no but the pen was a little distracting for me personally like

was really good like each of us was able to because if you had information i

i i try to facilitate it without like taking over

a little finished product

i know i would think the like a little jingle

new ideas found

people should really base they're both sort fruits or vegetables

way or a really speaker creative enough to think of toggle switch as in

i am really into the idea of kinetic batteries know after really about that's

i'm so excited

that as an ever need a battery "'cause" you're always moving

the project evaluated those kind a questionnaire

those kind a questionnaire and meeting summary

so just great products kids i think we've

i think we've created something really interesting and then
