and then to choose what colours want to make the buttons and if you
let's have our buttons all be one colour

two three buttons for adjusting the volume saved
could have up to three i mean the buttons could each
i mean the buttons could each could be up to three colours as

wants then decide what kind of button they'll we want to how many buttons
but i also like that aside buttons on that one like i think that's kind of me
and how many buttons do we have

the menu select button
but that has a menu button separate from selects button or is this one's the but
or is this one's the but the menu and the select button
the menu system and the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing but i think it's one

as rubber and special colour a
we've more than one special colour
we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours
is that two special colours
the buttons and special colour special
but then the buttons will be in special colours
rubber and it's special colour but that's important

but that's important six buttons
six buttons we have to have sex buttons

you can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push
's and we have our little menu button here if you push
if you push it if you're just pushing is normally they're the many buttons if you the volume buttons rather if you press
not unique i mean it's just it's it is just push buttons so that give
and if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons or you're constantly push and
they're all kind of just push button right

remember really we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons that they use
different shapes and then discussed of the buttons might work
grey and the optimal buttons work

to have like a joystick kind of thing you know
i kind of think it's unique and i thought i'd give it a one or so
no the thing about this silvery kind of way or something
i think it's kind of main do we do
that didn't have like any kind of table at
because that was kind of a big point
all kinds of possibilities
it's a kind of like the most typing in organising to do

we have the on off button at the chip very visible very big we have are
i've done it just just the four buttons on this one a
and if you wanna play any text on the device like labels on the buttons all the product and name or like a one or whatever
'cause we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off so then we wouldn't
i mean that's really got and the simplicity of the buttons down that one
the up and down buttons are used the scrolling up and down for a list of justice you find the choice
more confusing but if we had all the buttons in black and a designing and the outside and yellow that we're corpora wanna know we
buttons are also so the case

and then you have all the sides take a little bit more three-dimensional you
i'd say i'd give it a three years or depends how
i the three
it on the numbers and a thirteen point three anyway
really interesting and then we have a market for it so if we can produce the twelve point three which we hope
get three
there's only like three chairs
even if it was just like the title of it like the three presentations when we do three

where we i think we can kind of say we address the wood colour but
really are we just kind of start out by each taking a colour of clay and just falling around with that i came out
they don't have the right colour clay anyway

we have our colours not are not text but this is the general
i don't know what the set of the basic colours though
what are we talking about on each colour combination or we
colours as far as design there so
what the colours cow
get in one colour of the kitchen

right we made three different prototypes and
so that's three prototypes
in terms of making decisions what we need to do is first of all decide on the form which are the three different shapes to wants then
if we offer in an in at least three different colour arrangements

this middle button it brings up down screen menu and money
and money working on screen menu use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button how to select
but the middle button on the on screen menu function of the power button
what are the ipod for example you just every time you wanna go back in the menu button again it brings you
button again it brings you back one model
