as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote
function design phase i will be talking about user requirement specification and
and all be doing research to get this out and
an we doing marketing research on the web and then finally
of the ranking all the requirements to see how we did
the functional design is a teletext technical functions of remote control and
and the concept design the user interface have the usual
have the usual reaction product and the detailed design
what they should all of them a special
and on the industrial designer and this project and the functional
and the detailed design and the detailed design out be concerned look and feel of the product itself
so pretty much working together or we see on the design frontier
so we are putting together
we are putting together a new remote control
we want it to be something original
of course we're a not only in electronics company but
fashion conscious electronics company so
company so we want it to be trendy and we
and we want it to be easy to use
you get the functional design conceptual design and detailed design
which is the three of you
it's function remote
function remote villages just gonna change channels
so we want it to be a t. v. remote or i mean
i mean do we want it to do other things besides just be at a television remote
i think you never universal remote
this is my first i'd go around with creating a remote control so
one thing i thought remote control is you always lose them
maybe like user-friendly like
you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time so other
some ideas
we want to be a bubble you know
i've got control for the ball idea
the ball and maybe where the buttons are located
management is just simply so but maybe a
this is what is that's together and when you
think sometimes you know so too many buttons so a
the balls a idea because
a idea because of its stability rate but
a role so we'd have to have a flat on one side at least down here somewhere take away that part
i can't think of anything other than a long that i know the remote very

what are we gonna got that thing out of house cherries are gonna
house cherries are gonna be do we
whatever have to buy one every half a year
said people kind of throw it so ball
it so ball shaped you know if it were ball shaped maybe in it
could be case now so and
so we want to be motto
so are for men are function
we want it to be easy to find
that's more on the research done that the market then
and when you open it out go for about a flip phone and we call
i think it's inside i think
that's the one of the big issues also
the point is
the shape is perhaps not the most ideal as
as stable as it is the most be a
that's as you can ranges of design but it
ones but there's nothing mean there's a lot of the field
what my idea was just
big and bulky we could also try to do the hands then circuit like flip
i think that's it is and different
something with a grip
but then again people like to use one hand a flat than one hand to a
than one hand to a holder so whatever so
it last
the one and the design you also have the palm of the size why
'cause you know from cell phones they can be too small so

had something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five euros
and you know goals for
of course but that's of course a weak point
how would we go about it making you know getting rid of are we points what
i'll draw something what
so if go ahead

like a tracking device or
whistle or make a noise and then we
at idiap like some kind of but like from the lights around that sort
that sort of a bit nicer list also the moment know to do that but
does long remote because it's easy it's

want so they're kind a like a lawn in rectangular we want something
we want something new that's gonna stand out on a modern
a more modern
suppose i was a new designs assignments and that would only thing

interface i know what am i looking for i think that fashions what they should all
maybe as far as design goes maybe we can have different ones for different target audience those "'cause"
those "'cause" maybe one won't apply to all of the country is we're targeting

for opening our agenda is the
our agenda is the opening acquaintance which we can and i tool training project plan discussion and then closing
rental of twenty five minutes we have here so

on a modern so our remote should be
materials as possible
actually i think about the design i was i can't think

apply here however one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be a
thing supposed to be a first to the material pretty much on what are we gonna
take away that part that's the one

marketing you could it's find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there
i mean but we just have a flat spot on the bottom the ball not to put you on the spots
not to put you on the spots but

and as the idea for just something maybe
that's a good idea
it has to sell it is an inch that's just one

i'm nick the bus county project manager
county project manager we'll

and then finally and detailed design phase i'll be doing product evaluation and so i'll be
and so i'll be collecting the requirements of the ranking all the

i mean iron and i'm the user interface designer
time so other some restrictions we have to

and the functional design phase be dealing mostly with the requirements
maybe that's just draw some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have and then we can go

in the conceptual design i'll be problem most beginning of properties and materials of our product and
know where you can use both hands little keyboard to it then

and then we can go into how we're gonna design it in
we're gonna design it in and how we're gonna do the detail in on it

i suppose you try like a universal remote for
for click on all

products in one person's house but you know
but you know they also want to send all changing channels volumes and programming

like a tracking device
device or like out of the

it makes in a way is there's a button on
is there's a button on the t. v. and you press and

so we want to be sturdy we want it to
you're the industrial designer

or as you said people kind of throw
i mean rate design is something that's all like i

and we call it at the middle
maybe hinge of the strongest or not if we did

issues also you risk the hinges here that's a problem
what did you say your title was again

i feel like and the shooting everything down here i
you're the boss

we'll just get started with everyone kind of thing each other know who they are and what you're doing which are role is

i am current weighting and i

and i will be the marketing expert and

and a of the three phases i'll have a different role and

and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled and all be doing research

out and conceptual design phase i'll be dealing with trend watching an we doing

likewise i have three different calls for each stage design

and the detailed design and so on like the user interface i know what

of them a special

my mild

my mild and

we'll discuss what the problem what functions the product has to fulfil sounds on i suppose we'll

i suppose we'll work remotes together on that one

and functional

functional design

do we have any ideas of maybe that's just

gonna change channels its main function

click on all so logical

i think the working design principles so what i

so what i that's not time is it just infrared

time is it just infrared is not so not

i think run the same boat here

so we should set our remote control up to where it has a

you get those key but you

can we all the most sort of quite similar in their parents

black usual

we want something crazy we want

which circle for all

i thought maybe because people isn't as a remote control that applies to it was in

it was in a bowl and maybe

and maybe actual control's inside as

there of course certain restrictions you can't

we have to apply here

be do we want it to last longer or

or rather have people

so so we want to be sturdy

we want it to hold up to somebody's child you know throwing it across the room or as you

so and they seem to be inside

so we want to be motto and and sturdy

so we want it to be universal

goals for profits are i think somewhere around fifty million euros what they wanna make that so

also sons were partners of the international remote controls so c.s and maybe we wanna

maybe we wanna make it something that would global we appeal

some marketing

you guys have any ideas for what it should look like me we could write up

me we could write up on the board over there some ideas

we dropped will drop the ball and maybe

not if we did using judges two parts and then you have

so i a buttons

so a very simple as possible

just something maybe at idiap like

futuristic

that as a simple idea i have either you

have either you know you could show about

red one problem you get with this design is the balls

rate but of course it's it's a ball a role so

that's interesting of course but that's

and your industrial designer so

maybe i'll the shape

the most be a compromise between instability and design here so

the remote very small so fast ones but

it's not new it's not innovative it's

you know everybody does long remote because

it's stable

my idea was just to have a be kind of like

keyboard type say you know like video games also

video games also but maybe

but maybe i mean that would be kinda

i mean that would be kinda big and bulky we could

circuit like flip out that way i don't know

because even as posing with the ball

it might not be the easiest to hold onto

so perhaps the joystick the keyboard idea my work better but then again

is that the thing is stephanie the one on that one on the job
