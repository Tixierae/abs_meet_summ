i've got control for the ball idea
the balls a idea because

function design phase i will be talking about user requirement specification and
the functional design is a teletext technical functions of remote control and
and the functional design phase be dealing mostly with the requirements
functional design

and on the industrial designer and this project and the functional
you're the industrial designer
and your industrial designer so

i mean iron and i'm the user interface designer
red one problem you get with this design is the balls
the most be a compromise between instability and design here so
that's as you can ranges of design but it
i mean rate design is something that's all like i
suppose i was a new designs assignments and that would only thing
the one and the design you also have the palm of the size why
it would be designed in some in a way that you know isn't an example but

it's function remote
function remote villages just gonna change channels
gonna change channels its main function

i can't think of anything other than a long that i know the remote very
you know everybody does long remote because
does long remote because it's easy it's

so pretty much working together or we see on the design frontier
i think the working design principles so what i
appointed otherwise the design of whether the point of putting to sensors on both sides would probably work

and then finally and detailed design phase i'll be doing product evaluation and so i'll be
and the concept design the user interface have the usual
have the usual reaction product and the detailed design
and the detailed design and so on like the user interface i know what
in the conceptual design i'll be problem most beginning of properties and materials of our product and
and the detailed design and the detailed design out be concerned look and feel of the product itself
you get the functional design conceptual design and detailed design
we're gonna design it in and how we're gonna do the detail in on it
black usual

we are putting together a new remote control
this is my first i'd go around with creating a remote control so
one thing i thought remote control is you always lose them
so we should set our remote control up to where it has a
also sons were partners of the international remote controls so c.s and maybe we wanna
marketing you could it's find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there
for snow we've got about five minutes here to come up with our remote control idea and star role in with that we talk
we talk about our experiences with remote control and

we'll discuss what the problem what functions the product has to fulfil sounds on i suppose we'll
so are for men are function
looks but it's really not it's not functional so we've got our
questions what makes those game pads functional but i think that's

as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote
i suppose we'll work remotes together on that one
i mean do we want it to do other things besides just be at a television remote
i suppose you try like a universal remote for
i think you never universal remote
on a modern so our remote should be

you guys have any ideas for what it should look like me we could write up
me we could write up on the board over there some ideas
that as a simple idea i have either you
and we've got a couple ideas

i thought maybe because people isn't as a remote control that applies to it was in
or rather have people

we'll just get started with everyone kind of thing each other know who they are and what you're doing which are role is
maybe that's just draw some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have and then we can go
want so they're kind a like a lawn in rectangular we want something
at idiap like some kind of but like from the lights around that sort
my idea was just to have a be kind of like

it so ball shaped you know if it were ball shaped maybe in it
we dropped will drop the ball and maybe
rate but of course it's it's a ball a role so
because even as posing with the ball
so we went with the ball function
so then we forget the ball it
