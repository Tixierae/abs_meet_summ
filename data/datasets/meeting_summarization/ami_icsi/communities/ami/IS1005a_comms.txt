so what is the goal of this project used to design a new remote control so it should be
going to sarah we want to set of a cease remote control for twenty five euro and
like these and the second thing second point for me it would be that in the normal remote controls there is they are two buttons for volume control but
volume control but i prefer not like a petition meter or something like
you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control
you are going to try to find the user week or a man's of for a remote control

so we can start today twelve first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control and any idea so
so if you have some experiments go do but with remote controls you can share it and say what you think that's why do you know anything
you just the same colour the experience i

are you not afraid that is if you take your remote control you can move the slide and you could them is the volume can work very quickly and then
also you when you take two is the remote control for example on the table you take it and you push the button and it's everything this data and then

where are trendy doing she's meeting to start a new project which is about designing their remote control so
so it's more like going to do in the in t. v. do or walk or you know you need a whole speech eighties and going to
d. and so i will ask you to do some more watch and the
watch and the the interface developer will walk and and the design also remote controller stop
remote controller stop to it was a new i. d. and

i prefer remote control boarding be the radio waves because
radio waves because remote control a boarding be the infrared surveys you should you should keep eating a specific connection and then try it hard to you

so what it's weird try to
weird try to do best and
so that would try to draw the anymore she
so i tried to skate you know
i think they courses because they are trying can do to forty so

so no we are going to get used to two's it was going to use or doing owns this project so we can try
so we can try to use the white board here so
just to get used to sit white or
so we're not used and not only for switch on and that's for two

man and wanting to discuss about style first ideas and so on and
or not but we can try to write it what these are all five or a tiny amount and rights of a four weeks characteristics about it
i had to first so write it down because that's if i can that's a
so if we want to write each year i think i can
two points of first would be there in current the remote control there's no like lights so if you're

it and i'm going to be interface designer in this project
and it should be trendy and user-friendly that mean it's a
and the second one is the user interface designer
for the user interface designer which is a net

from experience i've had a remote controls in the past so that had very have had lots and lots of buttons and i've been very small has been very hard
has been very hard to use because there's so many buttons and
and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what's and
do what's and the buttons are very small and very hard to press
you know on a t. v. remote you in if we use mostly you know if for of six buttons
or not just to discrete buttons for volume but something

is the industrial designer really
the industrial designer really industrial designer
the technical design i
i think that's. i. d. industrial designer and the second one is the

so i'm going to be so the project manager of these the project
and i am i you can present you said
in the project i'm supposed to be the technique
so so today we are doing the short meeting to present a project so
so putting going to present
going to present that to what we are you where are going to use doing or this project talking
talking about the project man and wanting
that mean it's a very challenging project and
