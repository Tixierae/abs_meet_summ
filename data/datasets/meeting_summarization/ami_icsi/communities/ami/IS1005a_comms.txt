so let's talk about money
so it's frustrated me in the past

of a dolphin or
that should be remotes
your lapel mic friends for life
i left and it

where are trendy doing she's meeting to start a new project which is about designing their remote control so
peter if you like a name
man and wanting to discuss about style first ideas and so on and

so my name is but therefore so
my name's bob more
you are in the part time

in the project i'm supposed to be the technique
so if you have some experiments go do but with remote controls you can share it and say what you think that's why do you know anything
has been very hard to use because there's so many buttons and

so we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting
so what is the goal of this project used to design a new remote control so it should be
so it's more like going to do in the in t. v. do or walk or you know you need a whole speech eighties and going to

do if we're ready i
going to present that to what we are you where are going to use doing or this project talking

and so present myself and
and we can start

weird try to do best and
so what's what are we going to do doing this or this project so it's more

and going to meet each was a quite of fun to discuss and to find a good way
so no we are going to get used to two's it was going to use or doing owns this project so we can try

or not but we can try to write it what these are all five or a tiny amount and rights of a four weeks characteristics about it
making i would

a little bit could be put it here to make it a strange of a
never mind

should take me
and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what's and

maybe to discontinue that way
you wanna draw a know

so we're not used and not only for switch on and that's for two
we expect the production cost of maxim twelve point fifty euro

from experience i've had a remote controls in the past so that had very have had lots and lots of buttons and i've been very small has been very hard
do what's and the buttons are very small and very hard to press

and i am i you can present you said

name is but therefore so i can make a three year old peter if you like a

so so today we are doing the short meeting to present a project so

talking about the project man and wanting

so it should be of course new one or would you know and

and it should be trendy and user-friendly that mean it's a

that mean it's a very challenging project and

so what it's weird try to

and hope for the come with something very new one that people want to buy

so we can try to use the white board here so

so i would ask you want to do the same just to get

just to get used to sit white or

so that would try to draw the anymore she

she should read the picture of the other one is

you can draw a picture of course

go ahead

so i tried to skate you know

i had to first so write it down because that's if i can that's a

can you recognise it has to

so i think my favourite animal would be a cat

that is said

i like cats them as because they're cuddly in theory and that playful

i don't know if we should go with used

you know line width i'm

we put up there are many put on the desk or something

should get used to that too so i'll

should take me

i think they courses because they are trying can do to forty so

so if we want to write each year i think i can

maybe there if you leave it

you can draw it if you i

just i would like to see how it looks like

it may be like a caller

it may be like a caller i dunno what do i'm that good

i'm that good but we didn't draw it

it's embedded think i don't know what

no i think it screen

four

i'm same for the eye

it's in it's beautiful

will have training right

going to sarah we want to set of a cease remote control for twenty five euro and

and expected profits will be around fifty million euro

and trained to have a market or around the world

per unit i

so we can start today twelve first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control and any idea so

and minimally you any of the use you know on a

you know on a t. v. remote you in if we use mostly you know if for of six buttons
