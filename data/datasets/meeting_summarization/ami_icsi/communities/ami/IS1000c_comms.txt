the front line guys very the most important aspect was the design to cost us so i
g. d. maybe two designs and then cost

maybe just a idea of having a look or functions be at the top maybe bottom cells and then
so they don't have any comments our ideas on that i think you
look and feel of i've was a good idea
is the with a good idea like instead
like the idea to be ideas the right in the dark so either having

really the most important but that was the look and feel of the meetings
feel of the meetings that it's very different from everything else that they need to stand out a big
but having a remote is textile it feels different but really don't make it stand out
maybe we yes we maybe can decide later on you did you look and feel of

big event like the remote with the l. c. display for holding be as
a remote and maybe if you had a little bit of a wood display it may be there

so the didn't have time to the method do so what i've found
in or you don't know that's store all the haven't had time information to that
so i'm using the t. v. every time i use it could be like for example i can
i'm to have every time has to come down on this price again to
the bombay is just colours half the keys much the time
the time and inside have a back to get to that the more that's case
free to do that maybe having a button number time not moment i you know one so it's not as tight little box so it
thought about their time and time for this meeting

so we had a look at way what we can do with our product to make it stand out a make it to do what about
that we need to have some that looks interesting look exciting that will stand out people
to look at that be like that and think about inside it's got something that i want as a really page and it has to make
and that's one you look at just the other aspects
and the president market i saw it that says something like they're looking for a keyboard think a two word wish
i personally would look at things like i mean you know so the more is
so is there any t. v. you're looking at feature layers that's a slightly
it would be interesting if it would look for the cost of mentally other devices if you using speech recognition or something like that

that much hope on remote control or in mind that we need to have some that looks
we talked about having a way of finding remote controls as being lost and that's
for example you're watching a movie and you that having you do a solo remote control and you want to you don't know really reach functionalities maybe what corinne so i'm using the
what i'm gonna present here is very and basic knowledge about it or that the components that inside a see your remote control and how we did manufactured all what is a process is to explain you sell
that if there is a set of components in in our remote control regular
got two different types of are you from way of using the components for making a remote control
you know can concentrate on the basic remote control
when you don't use it you have such a an extent of your remote control that's you don't use
so maybe it's possible i don't know where you can take a gift that you can have to wear open your remote control and on the inside are the buttons you don't use that much

that you can program your remote so that
like a it could indicate to you were it could indicate what it's called like the but you have in a battery in your remote the blinking at the same then

it works what you don't know the store all channels in their remote control you
remote control you want this chose still your favourite channels

i hope for both with some more work concerning conceptual design
and it's some research for the cat design and fashion trends at that moment and
we devote to have two or three different designs the ladies
so i think we all fall our design want some that problem a bird you know the e. v. l. s. i. r. f. p. g. a. a high-tech energy and
might does the design we need
and for the designing of the co a colour layout then it's better to maybe see that too with the u. r. x. u. i. expert so that we can
so i can design something without you all agreement right
and then we can find besides think it goes design

i will take some minutes again
ten x. the idea of taking inspiration from finds the what
and yes the taking inspiration
you have a multiple functionalities the t. v. c. r. or something i say it to the t. v. and it takes that t. v. and you can program the keys if you want to second key that you wouldn't that and then formation
it may be there to keep taking the batteries so you knew we need a
so i take the new parts are some but on to printed balls because
or if you want just two or programs you take keys

that was twice as important as the next item on here which
yes ma'am when you make a design care you can next meeting you can given quite an exact cost price that
that for next meeting i'm river to do that
i think for next meeting we could you two can present a real design the sole drawing it on a board
but let's say next meeting will be produced two designs one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price
if it's for the next meeting now i thought about their time
that next meeting they should be
this is n. l. senator from a marketing point of view for the next meeting

other but there are some common keys for example
common keys for example if you want to forward a v. c. r. if you want to forward but it's the minutes from that and then we'll see they have a common thing it should be you can have and
it for example with if you want to put load a i wouldn't said just forward

important as the is the kind that what things we were discussed really the
tell you if you want to give go for three them to the user are
and we need maybe to some to a our discussion on a them as a really that what buttons what functionality want to offer to the user and maybe with a graphs i don't know how are the user interface
are the user interface design you could maybe that's on that

i think the much too easy for them that might do it here because
because you might have some information on the easy to use to
i don't know if we still on the ascii to be easy to use that's
you have it so it's easy i think you got me that's right away with that going in that customising at all if they want
it is very easy sell overcome very it's already implemented and know how much
and i'll let you can think of i mean it's easy it in as a remote and maybe
and david and you have to worry about easy they're easy if you go
they're easy if you go to a different ways of designing those key then again minus and the go
