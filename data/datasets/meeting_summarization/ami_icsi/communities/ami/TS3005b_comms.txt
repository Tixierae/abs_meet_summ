buttons that touch at the screen the buttons because
you can adjust which buttons you want on the screen
touch screen you get the buttons for part of that to other buttons are gone
because we can look at perhaps forty buttons a screen but the
a screen but the only the p. two buttons
if you press a button to the screen
we because we don't have a lot of buttons on one screen i think but
i if you use the l. c. d. screen you for to sort where's the on button menu and
but i think the remote control if you pressed that the screen it always should jump to the screen which has to fourteen button channel button and of course all also the on off button

of course mean settings buttons are settings options for the remote control
in normal button on the remote control or not

that means that functions use an want to have from the remote control or
remote control has to have a low power users because
because they use the remote control off more often and are
a that is are the market share to in our goal to deal of those remote controls
the remote control to
was these are all remote controls and just put
and it has to be remote control out
but they want to talk into it or a remote control something or
but not for the remote control or the t. v. that you use

screen l. c. d. screen it's easy to set of
so l. c. d. screen should be easy
but i at l. c. d. screen it's easy to use because
years have to press very hard to go to this year with the l. d. screen it's easy
with the l. d. screen it's easy because you only have a wide

volume button in detail but so the two most important buttons on the remote control so those that
turn the thing unless we are on button on remotes that

or in the l. c. d. screen
l. c. d. screen as in the screen
newt the screen also
perhaps we should focus on an l. c. d. screen
l. c. screen just like like a drum it
lot but that's not a special or the l. c. d. screen only thing you have to do
because the l. e. n. l. c. d. screen you run it on batteries there is a
and maybe a little bit three indicator on the screen
i think the l. c. d. screens should use of sufficient

this the player remotes not specific l. c. d. remotes
the remote quite a big remote that you have to fit i
then there's some remotes press and

want to explain the working design of the remote control is
we don't have to find out how the remote controls have to work or how
a little animation of know how it and i were to remote controller works

thing is you could reuse the buttons are you don't have to have
the buttons should be that small or
because just search for buttons which only going to use
but if you would do a nasty seem to have don't have any buttons or because it
to other buttons are gone
but no more buttons or functions or
good to have we'll use do you have a zoom buttons
and the buttons to have colours
so actually was great a button less no buttons at all that's

remote control is possibly very handy if you want to the design one of those
control of course is very handy is the remote controls hand-held so you

if you use it your c. d. player the remote control as as some like samples
as some like samples of remote controls you can see they're very

that she should be able to switch that control if you have an l. c. d. screen

that it'll look fancy with the l. c. d. screen
it looks fancy one a. m. l. c. d. screen
maybe you can make something fancy out of an l. c. d. remote because it's new
i think it looks a lot more fancy can use you don't have any buttons on the second remote control

i think that's for the standard motion button large buttons
and the possibility to in large buttons sort of large buttons

i wrote down some personal preferences about the remote control of
about the remote i think it would be better with the person reference but remote control has
