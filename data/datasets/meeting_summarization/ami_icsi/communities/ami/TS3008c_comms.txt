the button over here or whatever i dunno
want to it simplicity we have to big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons you don't need an l. c. d.

different colours
you if you do that maybe you just bring it out in different colours but not off
maybe in different colours

and it could affect a kind of grew up in in buying remote controls
solar cells are also a bit weird for remote controls
whole set of different remote controls maybe can bring
the remote control but i know
there's always and displays of course remote control i mean i think
and maybe i'm a banana is it's it's not easy for remote control but
yes but that remote controls are already on the market is simple
it and maybe very tiny on the remote control itself but
to the lawn wanna spend more money on the remote control i

like in the watchers but remote control can lie on the table for a date and then you push a button and so you don't have
so probably them for most used buttons on the in the remote control
so you can use the buttons all that already on the remote control for double functions

on the bottom of the remote you can
i we should reminders of the remote itself i

catch colours fruit
if it's fruits and vegetables it has to be colourful

but do a going to go are we going to give that to tone colour look like it the plastic mold is in one colour and thus those cushion pets around it are in another colour set the
like to tone colour to
in another colour not

when we only use basic functions we're supposed to make the buttons larger
the try and i also have to think about new functions maybe buttons or something like that and to control that's kind of l. c. d.
the functionalities so the buttons

i don't think our company colours for this fashionable
be true but it is our company colours

i was also looking for what you said four i got the name all about l. c. d. in front of the remote control i dunno if
the most important thing is a fancy look-and-feel of remote control
sell remote controls in a look at two colours no

and i think especially colour l. c. d. which is really pretty trendy but i don't think i think it will be too expensive
and it's a price also for monochrome l. c. d. or colour l. c. d.
no but it doesn't set say anything about the colour or but
yes real good colours
you can let's use the customer which colour you want
harder but also on the colours the younger
it's just the colour i would to which you changed and i it's to have one of these
or when you use the buttons as black you can use two colours as
in one colour is used

could be something special to our remote control and it's possible
possible but you get it it implemented in the t. v.s and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction t. v. within a month off to the release of our remote control
when you put a maybe a colour l. c. d. screen and it's very special a very trendy to have a remote control for

also the speaker in the remote control and you want to retrieve it and the base
i got an email with a with an remote control with a base so

over here i control with this thing but i'll try
we'll try way that i came with your remote control nah

we talk about the components design it's really about material and the really the we bill the remote controls off
remote control consist of components and
and the components of a remote control could just have a properties of material we have to choose
the components of remote control of course the case the properties
