will see most annoying things about remote controls and
the remote control "'cause" they just don't need it and then we
the remote control
that's too and remote control might not
you know a so you have to how the remote control is more like if you
but then the remote control i think i mean it in the idea
you wouldn't you would need a remote controls of the remote
remote control being i mean it and
"'cause" it's quite important you did you use the bit to locate the remote control

and what the functions of the remote control that's the
the main goal was to come up with those two things target group and functions of the remote control we've
on an a in a look at the functions of the remote control itself
so we need to do a with that functionality of the remote control
so at all the functionality of the remote control whatever
and and then just to put the main function of the remote control in words
so the findings where me and that the main function of the remote control is just sending messages to the television set so

remote control whatever new functions that we need to do make the chip more complicated and they're

percent of the buttons as came back to what you know saying idea about you need to you need all the buttons on the remote control is make
and everything else i think in a you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control "'cause" they
v. so you can go and press that button and but the remote control whatever it is it will beep so

so he is a functional or feel of the remote control
so is all of our o. k. a. how people feel about the look-and-feel of the remote control unit will see most annoying

is a menu remote control beeping and p. five minute "'cause"

what will i was thinking is that there is this a separation between what the channels are on t. v. and how they are numbered on the remote control if we can do with

what they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are say
current remote controls they don't match the user but maybe as you see

the as i told you are the identification of how the remote control looks and whatever we use parts to it and what are the different policies and how the parts communicate with each other
i'm so was to look at up and all that but in remote controls so mostly
seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly
at eighty percent of users would spend more sick at you know a looking remote control current
control is make it like eighty

i think the fact that you need ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five euro to say yes i would pay more for voice recognition or a control that's a quite a lot lately you know you
they have a lot of for voice recognition right controls
so you know think that defeats the objects and having voice recognition remote control way

so with regard to the working design of this a remote control have identified a a few basic the components of the remote and
not as an in an economic to design the encourages could use of the remote control and

which is an can we needed to the remote site which
the remote site which has an infrared receiver
site so this is what people
a remote i mean how often the people say my own t. v. to

but it but on the other hand remote control isn't it is close to you probably might just speaking to it and

what was all buttons but i think this is not really the right moment it's because people are just so
it's because people are just so used a buttons and

up and see what functionality they used and then
you know a functional say is useful but minimalist and as
