sent to i. so i just think that
think that the last minute i'm
and what the functions of the remote control that's the
we need to it we need to have a clearly defined group that we want to focus on an a in
and see from the design functional design perspective what i can we can now i know what exactly the components are and how
are and how they work together with each other
the identification of the components and
and update and come up for the new designs it's a cyclical process
so it should incorporate it and colour and the slogan that our company and it has its standard
so he is a functional or feel of the remote control
i think we need like some general discussion at the end
i think since the since way you wear discussing some design issues then i would like to india
she'll whip all this at i think that has
for example brightness and similar and functions could be just done through the menu and
can you mean the cable thing
to add to it
so plugged in that is working
popular with them so if you want to put in something stylish than than it would certainly be more popular with as it yet but the younger people as compared to order people
you share a television or something
if you can just look at up on a computer
seventy six point three percent
that was still quite popular amongst them to even they are
they've got my commitments and
say that discuss wanna do that

and also it's and the question is it because there's so many different and there's so many different things that could possibly be included because besides
so this is my little cloth thing
uses and so that's that the numbers a lot on the top or present that like them important is you know you say
know you say on a scale of one to ten how important is that and
and everything else i think in a you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control "'cause" they
site so this is what people
so this is what people find annoying about my controls at that
that can they are not intuitive and
and that bad for the repetitive strain injury i think if you watch
i think if you watch t. f. t. v. to get the best a strain injury from "'em" in a watching t. v. that's a list of you problem but
this is pink because i was copying and pasting the table and at times
it a say please my
is it in a setting should either be functional or beautiful or preferably by so i
say say maybe something where you clap and then it beeps and being a kind
five minute "'cause" you it that the label you lose it by throwing out the window something say
that's break it's very interesting

because incorporating other features makes it more calm complex
and the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet and the availability of internet or television how
and you could change things on the screen then for
i mean that was the directive it came through from management but if we had a
so it might be problematic to choose between all this possible things
hi i'm getting hungry
that you know at the at you want the whole that would work and a t. v. you name tends to be people talking and
my from a you know talking about this on the way in c. news wanting
in normally have a call on it's

and then they give them a questionnaire so is
control actually get many ounces on the l. c. d. screen so she's taken
are important and the rest of them you name nobody really uses and
by so i think we need to aim for both
or not map of thing
so we've got a parts ten fifteen minutes to discuss
remote control bomb a seeming key name yes
difference and i don't really

the agenda for the meeting i put it in this shared documents folder i don't know
on the what all bridget project documents
wise of people get all the most cats for bats and then less willing to
then less willing to try it i
you know a functional say is useful but minimalist and as

for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through and then i'll send
and then i'll send them to you after the meeting
the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing sharing the time so we'll go
you don't have to do it now but where once you go back to so that
it in my personal preferences i'm hoping that we can keep the design as simple and clear as possible this for the

that but this is there any any thoughts on that
functional requirements
and can you how you going to stop it from just flipping channels was watching t. v.
are of protect your it's
because you know like i mean you know if you university you're paying you when you can

last time "'cause" this is when you get to it shows what you've been doing individually the agenda
i don't know if that meant that you could see it or not
did anyone know
be a bit strange to have a fancy right now remote

so if you take in there as a shape project documents folder and it should be in there
but i don't many people that t. v. we
we didn't have the t. v. last year not want to of
that's too and remote control might not

pain we need to buy the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group is going to be and what the functions
then the most have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then
as you see on the next slide as
lately you know you say i mean they are and the displays or blink when i do think it's something to ignore uni

so with that i think specify hand over to you does anyone have a preference
so these are the ascension so at all the functionality
and then it must be easy to use so
not as an in an economic to design the encourages could use of the remote control and

no i don't have any idea about what each component cost
i if we're using more advanced technology much in chris the past
like a site
is a menu remote control beeping and p. five minute "'cause"

and the user would like to switch the channel
channel for example just means changing should next channel to flip through all the possible channels or then
channel so we would need the numbers and
as our target because actually i mean they all still young people

so now we are here at the functional design meeting
hopefully this meeting are we doing a little bit less talking and i did last time "'cause"
reject documents so put in

the last minute i'm about that but we can see how
like what it shows is how much things to use relatively and what
and what you couldn't really see from that is the thing that she's mouse is the channel selection what

that's the main goal was to
the main goal was to come up with those two things target group and functions of the remote control we've
what they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are say

i thought was last minute things you can make use of west
we need to the function "'kay" you things and it comes up on me
and at times as i can

so the blue function "'kay" at the bottom and f. eight
now it's coming computer and so
so one more time

for a moment adjusting
update so but for the time being that's all you have questions
that's a bit difficult to say

that was some of the main functions would be switching on switch off and the user would
sitting on off channel you mean
and among the findings i've found that most of the car and presently available remote controls also include all the functionality is in the design like operating a v. c. r. but they don't

maybe the colour tends to be rate or something
popular right so on my are
i think the fact that you need ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five euro to say yes i would pay more for voice recognition or a control that's a quite a lot lately you know you

numbers and then the one that's allows us to go to the next of the previous channel and then volume
but then the other functionalities it could be just
and the possibility of speech recognition l. c. d. screens your remote control

that would make the costs
i think that's i would think the pot and the buttons but
if we if the costs a lot we can have like an l. c. d. display and

where am i going in the right direction you know it
say you can see from that they you need younger people say just a five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more quite a quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software wise of people
and as it is an important things that you need people use when "'kay" when you filling up your hand you know a lot of people for the time we basic in a

so is all of our o. k. a. how people feel about the look-and-feel of the remote control unit will see most annoying
what you can't see is volume selection to little bit higher than all the others
say please my personal preference as i say we have

things like that whistle
whistle on the screen is that you
but you know how much money generally i would've thought it's

this not unaffordable but the problem is
but the problem is whether people need it to whether they do have a t. v. a. t. is at all
because one that or things like that point about was the how do we go about implementing it

but the t. v.s are off and kind of someone's olds t. v. that's bombard be a bit
i was having the general cocoa and most like sophisticated features would voice
would voice recognition itself i'm not very about because one that or

top
on an a in a look at the functions of the remote control itself

so put in there is the best
there is the best if i send you an email maybe to let you know it's a

office
the them but even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular right so

these were the basic findings from today the last
the as i told you are the identification of how the remote control looks and whatever we use parts to it and what are the different policies and how the parts communicate with each other

the last three bullets have the integrated from the last minute email
a it's a learning to drive actually say that discuss wanna

also the management wants that our design should be unique it
i think that would do said

there can be how about or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating
and and then just to put the main function of the remote control in words

this for the help us or to operate that technology at the feature point of time and
you could you call that for a second sitting

and also if we can incorporate the latest features in our chip design so that are remote control does not become outdated so on and it's compatible with more most the televisions that's about it
but the unfortunate i do not have any data so

do you have any i'd hear about costs at this point
so at this stage to how we go about implementing those buttons we will not identify or

cost
is that something to consider i if we're

data so i just identified the functional components
that's fine

it'll take some time
it takes

there's just nothing
and then and off having corpus inspiration and having compared to what i found on the web and just think about what but it will be easy really needs and what what the user might design as i additional functionality is

have you need to then also the press when you lost function f. eight so
and the one more time

so i'm going to speak about technical functions design and it just
and it just like some first issues that came up

or then what are the other possible that would be that it and she miked just want to choose one particular channel so
if we to if we take fifteen to thirty five but then does

and the last question i had to abort whether we wanted to incorporate the more functional it is the answer
slide and how popular was a

it's just whether it's worth arguing about
or i mean in that we can complete you two are the buttons and

a little screen or something that this would be really
keys and things like that

user and i mean they use it just wants to get data results and quickly not to spend time
not to spend time mean like and giving several doesn't matter i

pot and the buttons but if you have a then proposals
i think the colour costs a lot of the big role when we come to know about them so

here comes
cue "'kay"

you to twenty five percent a fashion side at eighty
but that she is how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software say you can

like eight fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons as
percent of the buttons as came back to what you know saying idea about you need to you need all the buttons on the remote control is make

if you explain it was sort of be fine
what i can send it only what it is

make "'em" to stop playing with the little pointier think
year not want to of our heads in a

that's the next one along
so you what the crash a is that you knew power channel selection volume selection are important and

part we'll do it in this town we can do and everything else
the remote control "'cause" they just don't need it and then we

this is the bit to the email myself i mean
email myself i mean that's what i was thinking about what does it mean like a

of you problem but you know a set that they
say i mean the r. s. i. d. thing would be that like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep you messed up to be something that encourages not as

be quite because you know you might control just sits there you could just sit in
a unions and say in

i think one of the interesting thing is that came up in the k. k. cats presentation was this issue of like voice recognition being more popular with the younger people so if we need
i mean that's the thing is they didn't say in the survey in a way of the "'kay" these the people that will pay more for more stylish remote control bomb

cats
so if we need to have a target group then i think as far as them more call for companies can send if you want to have things to be and you know good-looking we're better off targeting a younger audience and you know people are compatibility and ugly

it's a seventy something
to even they are seventy six percent of the have more

i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you take

i'll do that next time

time acts is circuitry for this meeting and just

then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that was sent to i. so i just

the last minute

but we can see how that affects what you were doing

and pain

we've got forty minutes to do that in

should the power good groups

as i know it is that we going to be trying to sell this thing too

does anyone have a preference for going first

i can go first

you wanna go first so

so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in new

and plug in new walls

yes him we just call it up

just before you start to make it easier would you three mind emailing me your presentations once we you don't have to

to so that i don't have to scribble everything

so with regard to the working design of this a remote control have identified a a few basic the components of the remote and

so this is the method

this is the method that mostly be following in my in my role

and since i'm dealing only with the technical aspects that would need feedback from the marketing person and from the user interface person we had an

we had an integrated this into the product design data technical level and

it's a cyclical process

email i just quickly to put them down

so they're them email

so they're them email said that teletext is now outdated so

so we need to do a with that functionality of the remote control

also the remote control should be used only for television because incorporating

how are a remote control would only be dealing the with the the use for television an hour to keep things simple

there's an energy source at the heart which feeds into the chip and the user interface the user

the user and for the interface communicates with the chip so

the chip so out this call were to the

if if this is our energy source the solar cell of it can make it it feeds energy into the chip which find out how to do everything there's

there's a user interface here

so when the user presses a button which feeds into the chip and the chip then

and the chip then generates the response and

and takes the response to an infrared terminal

so the output of the chip is an infrared bit cold

which is an can we needed to the remote site which

the remote site which has an infrared receiver

so at all the functionality of the remote control whatever

remote control whatever new functions that we need to do make the chip more complicated and they're

so it in my personal preferences

we definitely need to operate within the constraint but the

anymore questions or should

questions or should we just skip straight to the next one and then we

to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together and

said you wanted

and have you need

something is coming out

home no signal

computer and so you know

no signal light

my computer one blank now

adjusting

i don't see anything on my computer now this is the problem but

if you press it if you press function and that again there's usually three

this is the problem but

there's usually three no it's one where it's only here one where it's only there on where it's both

just for a moment adjusting

that's fine that's good

that's from the beginning so i'm going

so the method

so the method i was adoption at this point it's not for the whole period of the all the project but it's just at the at this very moment i'm

i'm so was to look at up and all that but in remote controls so mostly

so mostly just by searching on the way up and see

up and see what functionality they used and then

so the findings where me and that the main function of the remote control is just sending messages to the television set so

set so this quite straightforward and that was some of

and and also the volume is very important

but they don't seem to be able to deal with d. v. d. players but

d. v. d. players but then there are actually there are many of that functionally functions that could possibly be added to them but according

them but according to the last minutes update actually we do not want to have all this complicated functions at it to our design so my personal

so my personal preferences would be it to keep the whole remote control small and just like the physical size and then it must be

easy to use so it must follow some conventions like where ball to find the on off button and maybe the colour

channel and then volume has to be there but then

be just the could be a menu button and you

is the answer was already know because of the last need update so

all you have questions

but if we had a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and d. v. d. i could get back to them and see

because besides e. d. and d. v. d. day rubbed media c. d. is an with so

and there any questions for clarification of market before we go on to the next one

so in the user interface requirements so and that we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want

and have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that but

i think the buttons are still kind of the most in easy for the user to use i mean and

i mean and what are the options we do have a little screen or something

that this would be really kind i think a lotta learning for the user and

so now we can probably weekend and we have more knowledge than that if

in because we do want something fancy and fashionable as so

we can discuss that maybe after the next one to add to it

try to press

try to press

so i have why have got my information from as a survey by the usability have i'm said to my control use with a hundred subjects and then they

will see most annoying things about remote controls and

screen so she's taken up at that you're

became same what they found

say you need it definitely should be looking at something quite different seventy

seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly

at eighty percent of users would spend more sick at you know a looking remote control current

current remote controls they don't match the user but maybe as you see

as i was asking is the

it's and switching between channels sort of randomly going through

be have a little thing that comes up at the bottom and tell you what's on like eight

control is make it like eighty

what it is these kinds "'cause" that would be more

'cause that would be more exciting but

i like the god

yes can make "'em" to stop

that's the next one along

that and you need channel selection volume selection are essential and the power

and the power button is not quite so essential part we'll do

at that they get lost that can

the remote control

control and may not straining your wrist watching t. v.

i say clearly voice recognition is a need to think about that

say we have sleek stylish sophisticated they say something

in a new poll this and you just like what the hell is that there is there any is it in a setting

like a banana long battery life like you were talking about adding up and

up and you know i was thinking that solar power be quite because

you could just sit in the sunshine and save

the sunshine and save the environment a bit and

a to say you need kind of like you have a mobile phone or not map

some kind of having seven

i mean is where my from a you know talking

c. news wanting us that they needed a one for everything say

and being a kind of summary then often here on the t. v. you need is a menu

i'm just gonna take minutes

though but the so we did say that and things like voice recognition are more popular with them so

then again i that to where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five brackets and i don't know how often

and i don't know how often they're buying televisions

that's when you get a unions and say

you share a television

i would've thought it's more that twenty five to thirty five when people are really making us and i've got their first job and i want then asked always and

right but it's still if you can go back to that slide and

we unplug do it

people would think twenty five to thirty five how popular was that was still

i know i mean i know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five euros but

to twenty five euros but i mean it has been proven that the people at that age group have a high disposable income because you

paying you when you can home mortgage in

home mortgage in a life insurance policy in

usually know like power and all those things

i mean like is in a script on it really i think

and if we're talking twenty five euros is the price that's not unaffordable even for the yen painful

no i mean as as like fifteen pounds in a

it might not even function with the l. t. v.

i'd we've got quite a decently

or what maybe we can just kind of them

but and the same time i think maybe we can just decided to have so this group so as our target because

it's not a massive difference and i

but then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition is that gonna have a an

is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs
