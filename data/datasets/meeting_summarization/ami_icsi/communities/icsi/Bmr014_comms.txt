we didn't have a friend in meeting today
you know you know where we are in the corpus
right you know i've i'm tempted after she's taken any courses in this area or she's taken kind of science courses because narrow
i have one questions are you thinking that the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transfer because
maybe i'm wrong but the way i imagined it was that the largest set of people is going to go i didn't say anything funny that mean just go ahead
where's the release
and for them the easiest way to flip through if it's a really large document me not
me not searching
and say if you have a problem with it contact me and i'll give you a password
what you said i know that it that's right that's true that's more severe but the next one says
know that it that's right that's true that's more severe but the next one says the transcript will be around it

it is must be covered fifteen
and on the other question i was thinking about is a couple of things first of
it will be fishing for them to do
so you know just a matter of these days i suspect
and i also have a bunch of scripts
i don't know i mean you see the if he definitely not available today
the transcript it be separate the letters would be separated in space
but i'm not if it's necessary clarifying what it is so gloss of
maybe it's a thing to do because of it then indicating this is a step away from maybe indicating that it really is intentional those bases are there and indicating why didn't
things and then channel eyes just to then get it into this multi channel format at

would you talking about because i know that as arise also in the process of looking at
so they charge right and nothing against you
use different tools i just want to talk to jane about how we transition to using those he has a
right i've i don't i think we have at least one user for the digits once they get down to be
already done five or six sats so
we don't have active one but i'll make is on the
and potentially they'll have curly bracket thing and afterwards
to i don't think there's anything in legal aspects that is hurt buyer expressing that bias and then great
you know you might be right maybe was just paranoia on my part of people just some noise

i heard from u. w. that they're there very close to purchased that they're buying
i certainly read books by hand for something
by hand for something like this i think it's easier to do it on the web
city price search mechanism good every place they said something or something like that but see them are getting
that's where it's at that and the thing is from the standpoint
that's where it's at that and the thing is from the standpoint of the
formatted it's all ready to go and i could just inserted so maybe you don't give them access to the
it's the consent form is right in there it seems they have the right to have a all right fine

what i've done so far and i want to get some opinions on how to finish it up
if they are then they can't be used
and i'm help out his own time
not showing up if it's a meeting that he's
so in order i
that's the only thing with them but the quality
it was an interesting approximation put in parentheses because i had this convention

three wires work right we found
if we really oriented towards that extreme case make it really easy we're going to end up encouraging ahead
sort of sinking myself out here i'm trying to
in some ways the one who said it or someone who speaks spoken about we definitely want to allow the option of being bleeped out
but i really think we want to make it a rare
but there's another aspect of and then is that in the informed consent form my impression is that they that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript and
the transcript and i don't know that there's

a couple of things first of all if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable we should probably just go ahead and get them
and i'm currently you can't chain those together
they charge right and nothing against you and your on but
and then i have a bunch of scripts that will read those and like the transcribers use different tools i just
he wasn't there a cough
the psychic way but it's

along with a couple of the wired that aren't working one of the wired that's not working with a wireless
right so i next thing is this we better
i want to just be able to go to the website and visited as they want going
thing i had assumed that we didn't need their signature up that an email approval was sufficient
i know where you're going for me that would be my most convenient i understand i think that's a bad idea
and they will be removed both from the transcript in the recording

hours
yup got any more than thirty erica couldn't
suit tried to approximate it but it was
provide but certainly i wouldn't want to print out these are big
i think most of the people in the meetings are depends on what meetings that's true
to check for that not just for fun

for spikes and then we'll go the thing there and then right
let's see i i would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on recording transcription you know
and then the thing that i would like to talk about which is real medically thing deal is agendas
to be talking about because peripherally involved to this point and
no we for the most about privacy we have to worry about all

so it's say roughly ten hours or so
i started more than that but of non distance and be more than that because i my may recollections minutes that they just don't take more than
of non distance be more than that because i my may recollections minutes that they just don't take more than half a minute per person
because you're going to get you know if i'm i mean a bunch of meetings and i don't want to get a stack of these i want to just be able to go
for the most frequent case they just say it's and for different people

were playing the lawyers game and we're playing we're we're looking for the extreme case if we
and useful for someone else if they need
so you're but i think the issue of privacy needs and so forth should be that they get access to this if they really need
so you're saying that the sequence would be more like first adam goes to the contact lists context m. b. a whatever their preferred method is to see if they want to review the meeting right
and then if they don't you're done if

i'm just type
so here's what i was imagining and from the transfer because i do think that there's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and
all and i would rather they were able to edit out other people and just it don't distributed at all
i'm certainly for everybody who's been in the meeting so far would be sufficient i'm just wondering

they also i'll start with that actually
actually andres brought up fact that he was kind of like to know if possible what we were going to be talking about because
i think that there are subset and then they hand it back to you
no we for the most frequent case they just about privacy we have to worry about all these passwords for different people

and there's going to be a topic about discussion about something that he strongly cares about than he would come and
order i think that this is a wish on his part
on his part it's actually going to be hard because it
right the only on the my cost of the mike's anything's today station is nine hundred dollars

than he would come and i think part of his motivation this he's trying to help us out and
i think almost everyone would rather do that by e. mail than any other method
i mean because you don't have to visit the web page you want too that's true i
it we have to provide we have promised that we would ride in the transcript and that they can remove bursts that they don't like

actually i was going to say we need that topic of the topic i was thinking it was just status on microphones and channel and all that
actually i was going to say we need to talk about that too and channel and all that
the new microphone the new ones are in
and i didn't bring my car today so i'm going to pick them up tomorrow

we have about thirty two hours
question number two is how else do we want to provide this information if they want it
and it really depends on what kind of research are doing i think some
get email it's all formatted it's all ready

i mean certain number of them did put the words down
it's just iran iraq now is speech unstitched sector on different telephone
preferred area there were some in and then up to maine and i had to just pure
now that chances insisted it to thousand thing you but i call that's

and i haven't been able to use the ex
actually have you also been doing spot checks is my top her to get the data clean and challenge
actually have you also been doing spot checks chain and challenge yes
mean i thought that you were made denison

and so can they bleep within another and whole
and that was just convenience for my sake that it's
but the problem with what you're suggesting is not just inconvenient for them it's inconvenient for me because that in the
because that means multiple contacts every time for every single meeting every time anybody wants anything

do another try at coming up with each and at some point before the meeting
and then there's he she wants the actually it explicit marker what type of comment this is so
basic thing is this tremendous so there's still no

right and right now it's you know six
more of an attempt to
equivalent you get an email address

right but i think that at least message we can tell other people that our experiences like possible so
one thing you have said that actually concerns me a little is the time but changing that's just mean changing
but as i said they're coming in so that's being done professionally

right they're maintenance people
i don't see any way of avoiding as you say you know so like likely he said
i don't see any way of avoiding that like likely he said

so dave isn't here but he was going to start working and some things with the digits
so he'll be interested in what's going on with that i
was a decision last time was that transcribers we're going to be doing with that it just as as

that it just as as it started it would be to
right so that it started it would be to use as interface and i was going to meet with him today about that
non digits i mean it's to just

so if you want to you know just have a few to start with you could
and i also have a bunch of scripts that will like generate p. files and run recognition on the malls
he's invited to these meetings

i don't know if davis on the list
we don't have active one i don't tend to get an invitation myself
we don't have active one

he many called his office and see
and that was that's my strategy travelling a lot of these things in terms of things that need to be closet
that need to be closet and get to that point but so

transcription is beyond the digits and
that's great convention but i haven't been asking these
planning on so you know you get a whole long list exactly

non digits i mean it's to just
and also that we know of corporate these additional conventions that was requested in terms of in terms of having us systematic handling of numbers and akron m.'s which i hadn't been specific about
have that good use of it that's the way that's you know spell check

pleasantville appear next to each other and exactly and then you can do it
in the alphabetize list filter next each other and that makes it easy i agree it's a very good it's a very
actually i have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two or transcribers

because i had this convention that if they're not what it was that put it in parentheses suit tried
large i mean how do you read books
and i mean i'm just a little worry about making it so easy for people to do and so

but but she knows she didn't know what maybe
but she you know her technical the perception is just really you know i've i'm tempted
out it's not just that they want to print

right because narrow mats and she has some things that are down samples you got that right
whether moving right along they're
there was one or two once or twice and they were the meetings preferred where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by overall

and again the main track that you're working that is what eleven hours and
but that's our decision then right
the conversation of i say we were having a conversation and i consider that conversation private and i consider that your side of it is enough for other people to win for i want to be able to believe out your site i

mature about the trim
we've done with a prescription
and whole letter and whole letter it's only

and that way each person only has to remember one password
i mean for me i would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription sort of flip through it
but to check this for things that they're worried about having said or if they're willing to just send approval of it from their memory

i camp i wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed i mean
but see them are getting more ladder of this thing
of people i mean some people are do their work primarily by sitting at the computer flipping around the web others

so giving them you think a website to say if you want to print it out here it is not sufficient point
certainly for everybody who's been in the meeting
thinking about that they don't like to write from somebody else

we do because of privacy we
that's more open than i realized
the one question is definitely clear anything as opposed to just what you said i

sounds like a spike
you don't know what they could be handled by hand because you know i mean

when asked about some odd you monitoring on some of the equipment in particular
equipment in particular

i didn't mind
i didn't mind and then you ten they some attract

and then you ten they some attract in listening to
i mean were they say professional audio recording we would do what you would do is in testing is you would actually do all this we're going and make that things are not giving that kind of performance if they are then they

in listening to some of these meetings of recorded there sometimes big spike some particular things in a packed in fact
i don't think it's that much harder than paper way

it could be a number of things that could
that's just mean changing connector which means some hands honoring or something

could be a number of things that could be touching unsettling and the other thing is that
the fact that it's on a wired might get suspicious it might be a connector

and then go and when they go transcribe it could ask him to come get you right
and then eight hundred per channel

to help us out and because the fact that the meetings are tending to become reasonably large now days when everybody shows up and
shows up and so he figures he could help that out by not so and i'm

that'll be i think that'll help will help a lot actually put that on my spare brainer will not get done i have to tell
that we really would rather it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out

she ends up getting the gender class ten minutes before the meeting but
that they're buying something that just of buy off the shelf

the meeting but
if you agree to participate right of that's true

i'm wondering if you were just specify particular topics
i mean if people have

i would also maybe we be able to meet that requested his little
i would also that as we get more into processing the data and things like that we more things of interest

it this maybe brings up another topic which is
i'm pretty that you can daisy chained together so what setup

so we'll have to evaluate that when they come in and get
then the other question i had is maybe we should get another wireless

so we currently have one base station with six wireless mike
possibility six wireless receivers and i'm currently you can't

so it you know it's still it's fifteen minus six do we
right so we could have up to nine

i don't quite understand how that works if then just go ahead and order
so we're not increasing the number of channels now we're just replacing

but we had more problems with
and it's sort of bypass is the whole ten bucks thing and all that and so

max as long as we're conscious about the batteries seems to be
i check in this everyones marian seems to be

i really and so you know we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that
i don't know how much of it's public i don't know probably shouldn't persons on refunding

as professionally i you can get it done
i don't put flipping through a hundred pounds a hundred pages of is not easy on the way

and then you will see tomorrow looks like
so it's not the conflict a cough

i think he's taking two twenty five day which is now
so if i'm in a team

as of i a week and a half ago so
so right now i'm about thirty five hours

that's including digits right
that's including digits i haven't right so

what i mean by clean is that they're spell checked that the markup is
that the markup is consistent all the way throughout and also that we

already be doing this but i've noticed in the past when i've gone through transcription this and you know in order to build like the concept things if you
things if you just take all the transcription separate him into words and then alphabetize them lot of times just scanning down that list you'll find a lot of inconsistency sickness misspelt you talking about that i took in frequency

comment this is so it curly inside the curly brackets are going to put either vote for vocalized like cough or laugh
like cough or laugh or whatever

non book four door slam
right and gloss for things that had to do with they said is spoken form of this method and a stationary have that

you don't know what they could be i mean not tim
not tim it's clear and peel l. p. is clear

the how are you doing i tend to live numbers individually
the only question is no i don't you've talked me into that but i just think

right what it is so gloss of whatever
i don't know if it's really necessary to do that

and it's so they'll be difference in comments but
difference in comments but it's word by word the same in huge patches the day and i ten

that the total said that i gave them is twelve hours of tape but
they haven't gotten to the end of that yet so

they're very efficient there's some that have more hours
but if they want to put it out that's all right i think everyone in the meeting

outputs and i just gave one meaning to live school wanted to it writes for the recognize that
and then they'll be a subset of people right

that's the record that have problems with those long chunks of speech which took too much memory or whatever and
and so she will try that i think

however and a bunch of tools that will generate webpages with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and listen to peace pieces and they can scroll through and read them and then they can
and so i thought about this a little bit and i think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password a single password each person

and then they can check on each one if they wanted excluded and
and then it's more make won't form forms they can submitted and it wound up sending me e. mail with the times they want excluded

and then each meeting will only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it
i mean you're you're not necessarily going to be sitting at the desk all the time you i

working out but i my thought was that thee occasion somebody wondering whether something was or not they needing to listen to it was going to be extremely rare
not secure so they have to call me and ask no but you aren't necessarily giving them

right i mean so that the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that i already had done for other reasons and so that's
and so that's a minor part of it i just want some web

the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted
it's just some noise they make a visitor face so much fun people start sleeping so justice just because they can't

and just tell them here's a webpage
need a password so that the question number one is how do we distribute passwords

cake they'll be a subset of people who will say i really would like to see that
and that but if they so i actually think the papers more universals

and then i figured that out of that group there would be a subset would go you know i'm really not about the section here
and then that group would eat it

i'm not a lot lawyer but it strikes me that
but it strikes me that we wouldn't want someone to say yes i was a little concerned about it but it

it but it was too hard to access
so i think it's kind of to have this facility to listen to it not in terms of like

next certainly but it seems to me that sometimes you know he if a person had a bad day and they had a tone and they're boys that they didn't really like you know it's to be able to listen to it and be that was
next certainly provided principal version if people want it

no i think we have to be able to print it out it's not just that they
i quite don't think we can send attacks through email because the privacy issues good for security good

so does that mean that i can't use e. mail
what i she just had a dream i anything

it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it this other parents level because
level because this way and just delete an entire line out of it transferred file rather have to do it by hand there's another aspect

i think you're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do
we but we don't even necessarily need and it's turning passwords at all

or printed out for to some extent i have to do that anyway because i said we have to distribute passwords there's there
or printed out for to some extent i have to do that anyway because i said we have to distribute

seems like a perfectly reasonable compromise and if they want
compromise and if they want to print out they can print it out themselves

having access to it doesn't that you were made denison chirping what you said but it's
having it having access to it doesn't necessarily mean that having it right what you said but it's giving it to them

they just have to make that is available to them was saying they it's available to them if
to them it's available to them if they ask for

it's just a check box next to the tax it's not any fun at all just because they can't had
i kind of had fun you played me something was bleeped out

i think the dates written

written and actually if everyone could cross out the are nynex the session and right and are eleven

and it's remember also to make that it's marked as does red unread is

it's clicking i'm it's i to get this to work correctly magenta

gender items today

i'd want to talk a little bit about getting how we're going to get people to edit it parts of the meeting that they don't want to include what i've done

really in a packed in fact this one i'm talking on it's one of the ones that should have been one of the meetings so

spikes you mean like instantaneous click type spikes or click

i don't know what the electronic been

it might be a connector maybe

you could then we don't really have to talk about that is i take it off

you could try and experiments ask him about the test for spikes and then is i take it off the agenda

you could try and experiments is i take it off the agenda

come get me when you transcribe this if it's

going to be hard because it seems like a lot of times things come up that are on anticipated

but we could try anyway do another

maybe it would be a good idea see the day before

maybe it would be a good idea for one of us too like on wednesday or tuesday send out our mind or for people to send in agenda items see the day before

all right so we'll send out the agenda request

that'll be i think that'll help put that on my spare brainer will not

will help a lot actually get done i have to tell

actually i have to tell you the for the the admin meeting that we have fly let does that every time before that had been me

between try

weird things have happened

sort of on that topic of the topic

and they are being assembled as we speak i hope and i

come in and get people's opinions on what they think of them

another wireless setup means expensive

setup means expensive but it does seem to be better than the wire wired

so how many channels to get to you know wireless setup

chained together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless so we currently

and we could replace are wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mics

and we have five we're getting one more

and it's about nine hundred dollars for the base station and

i don't quite understand how that how so all look into how you daisy chain them and then just go ahead and order

the number of channels now we're just replacing the wired the too wired that are still working

three wires work right we found

i three wired to work but we had more

and all that and so we seem to have reliable way of getting the date in which is through the written sign radio max as long as we're conscious

thing with them but the quality seems really good

this needs to be pleased that i have no clue

i don't know how much of it's public i don't know probably shouldn't persons on refunding

but anyway this there's other activities are going on there and and destiny w. so

them do it so it's on handsaw ordering it but i'm not doing it so

you've never seen my hands are very

as i said they're coming in so that's being done professionally

i mean it's just there repair shop a lot of it's

right so that decision was that chain did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork so

of the paperwork so i did all that last week so all

so all in all the forms are now on the computer

he has a setup that they

i don't think it'll take too long so i would

but i'll make is on the list

he watched and many still taking classes his office and see

he watched and he was in many still taking classes so he may have conflicts his office and see

he watched and many still taking classes his office and see

he was in have conflicts he wasn't there a cough

i think it's close he might it can say signal processing class was like tuesdays and thursdays so

i think it's close tuesdays and thursdays

talking about david gilbert

and the recordings also just for

so i'm she do we don't want to do the recording status first or

how much of those digits so

i haven't separated outside no clue how much of that is digits so i waited

is digits so i waited at least probably thirty hours

non digits i mean it's to just

yup non digits than thirty erica couldn't it's to

i mean the digit something up that much time just

i mean the digit something up that much just

and the transcribers i

i i don't have the exact numbers but i

but i would think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished transcribing from them right now

the next step is too that i'm working on is to ensure that the date are clean first and then channel eyes what i mean by

for example it they'll say ninety two

nine too right exactly so if you just say nine

so if you just say nine to the many sways i couldn't express and i just had them

you know chain but now we have a convention which also involves having followed by i lost

one suggestion you may already be doing this but

inconsistency sickness you talking about that i took in frequency listings and i use those two you

those two you mean just any show on each line there's the one word right just

the one word right just one token from the corpus

those are extremely efficient and i

if you already have that efficient and i agree that's a very good use of it

you know spell check does that but in addition

that but in addition yes that's

pleasantville yes that's exactly the strategy i want to do in terms of locating these things which are you know cloak wheel spoken forms which are like on exactly and then

pleasantville appear next to each other and in exactly and then you can do it

it easy it's a very good suggestion and

point but so their numbers and they're akron m.'s and then

that's and a stationary have that convention but i

that's great convention but i haven't been asking these people just max

people just max i think can be most efficiently handled by a by a filter that was what i was always

that was what i was always planning on so you know

you get a whole long list exactly what you're saying

you get a whole list of things as they curly bracket laugh curly brackets

you know it's you risk less air if you handle it by a filter than if you have this transcriber laborious lee typing in sort of books based on in so many

based on in so many ways that can be air prong so

prong so i'm going go into convert that by a filter into these tagged some kind of rice comments and

and same thing with you know if you get a subset when you do what you're saying you end up with this with

you end up with this with you clubs across frequency just have it opens and you can

and you can have a filter which more efficiently makes's changes but the numbers

but the numbers in akron have to be handled by hand because

but there are things that are not so known and or

or have variant you can use like the numbers you can say nine to even say ninety two

so how are you doing the i tend

how are you doing the akron and so if i say p. c. m. what would it here on the transcript it be separate the

and indicating why didn't indicate that it's you knew them rated or the psychic

that sounds good way but it's week just stick ways stating these letters

and so anyway the clean those are those things and then channel

format at that point then it's ready for use by listen dawn but that's been

dawn but that's been my top priority beyond getting it town channel the next

channel the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of time vince

and if you had a breakthrough with this last week in terms of getting the channel based see on speech segment patient up and running and i haven't been

we see that's part of the cleaning process i spent

part of the cleaning process i spent actually

and i went through it last night it's almost spooky how similar these are word for word and there

and there are some differences in common with commas i left discretion commas

commas and so because it's

because it's not part of versed are barred me you needed conventions

patches the day and i ten minute stretch where i can show that and sometimes

that and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better year for technical jargon and

the other one has a better year for cloak wheel speech so

speech so the one in that caucus speech person picked up gobble the cook and

when and on this side this was picking up things like meryl nets and the one that's good and spun vocabulary on the cook will didn't

for the person who missed probably look what that they put

sort of how it sounds dispelled g. a. b. l. yes

of how it sounds yes

it was a technical term that she didn't recognize i mean it was very clear heard these this was the sound of the sounds

it was a technical term that she didn't recognize was the sound of the sounds but but she knows

obscure and some of these are rather unexpected

but ten solid a chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coated the same data

that is that's including digits

the end of that yet so there's still working some of them are to them is to working on completing that

there's some that have more hours that they devote to it than others

so what's the deal with your

@reject@ thing

on different telephone and in the in this new multi channel for one and london outputs and

i'm working on it so

it so i hope is this anything different

i hope no is this anything different than p. h. m. system you're using before

i knew some different features but not the before

tremendous it's so there's still no knowledge using different channels that the same time you know i mean

it's as the entries is us to cross channel you know i mean course all of them

but that's one of the many changes

personally of the features besides

i just she tried some different teachers

i just i he was our office space things now if they

now if they preferred area

fletcher months monson

and that's been all my life the teachers felt nothing how about this within one channel

because there to be able to distinguish between four going to back on speech and

and it rick's all but nautilus

but nautilus

right so the idea is that we need to have we need to

to have we need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sex is they don't want

and so some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue and so i

a single password each person a lot of single password user name and password

i mean it depends how this really ends up working out but

i just want some web interface of the people you didn't actually have to send everyone the text some out

some out what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready i would take them and generate the web pages and send

you need a password so

means maybe sounds trivial effect but i thought if you handed them some sheets of paper that said here's what was said in this transcription is that with you and

i think that with you and if it is here's this other sheet of paper that you sign says that it's and then they

i think that there are subset of people who want printouts that we can certainly provide but and then they hand it back to you

and i would much rather be able to just sit and leafed through it you find it easier to go through a

be able to just sit and leafed through it you find it easier to go through a large i mean how do you

as they want going to a website is easy put flipping through

so here's what i was imagining and maybe i'm wrong but the voice and

there's this because think of who is we've been recording say

searching course should be like time but if you're not

you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really long document i mean whenever

document i mean whenever i've had are really long document that was sitting on the web i'd always ended up printing it out i mean

all the time you i figure you have a train ride is always situations where were i mean this

i mean this i was managing anyway and then

eat it seems like if i'm right

if i'm right in that it seems like you're setting it up for the most infrequent case rather than for the most frequent case

no we so that now we have to worry about privacy we have

i we don't need their signature i an email

that was another i an email i'm

that was another thing i had assumed i'm

are people going to be allowed to leap out sections of the meeting where they weren't speaking don't actually know yes

if someone feel strongly enough about it and i think they should be allowed to do that i also

so that means other people or editing what you say i don't know but

so that means other people or editing what you say i don't know if i like i don't know but

that the only other choices that the person would say no don't distribute this meeting at all and i would rather they

but if but what they signed in the consent for with something that said you can't use mine

but if someone is having a conversation and you only bleep out one side of it that's not sufficient but that's

because if i object to the conversation of i say i think it

i agree that the consent forms were i can agree with what adam saying

agree with what adam saying that they consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive what whether they said them or didn't say that and the

not in terms of like editing it by hand i mean i think it's if some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edit could but it

it i mean it's also a mixture of people i mean

around the web others to not

others would consider it this a

it this a set of skills that they would have to gain

i think most of the people in the meetings are the former depends on what meetings that's true

in the meeting so far but we're trying

but we're trying to expand this right

i think everyone in the meeting can access the web no i think we

i'm just thinking for people that's not sufficient for what the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and handed to them i'm just wondering about email

i'm just thinking for people that i'm just wondering about

i think it's easier to bucks

just put the bible on another page would say please send me the script

it's right that's interesting

when you displayed on the web page what are you showing them letter

are you showing them letter and says sir

whole letter and this letter it's only

there's another aspect of this you maybe as part of vices bother

i mean that's why did the web form because for me that would be my most convenient i understand

i know where you're going i think that's a bad idea

see because you're gay really you're going to

really you're going to end up with all these little touchy things where is really what we want to do is have the bias towards letting it go

because nobody ever

overall people are talking about technical topics nobody's

nobody's going to get hurt

nobody's being libel

you know this is this we're covering were playing the lawyers game

i out here i'm trying to but

i i don't see having a few phrases here and there and a meeting being that not much of a headache bleeped out so trying to but i think that's

i think what bleeped out so

i think what morgan thing is the easier it is the more is going to be bleeped

i think some researchers are going to be working with this corpus years from now are really going to be cursing the fact that there's a bunch of in there that's missing from the dialogue

it depends on the kind of research they're doing that it might be

that it might be it might be really of a pain

and you know where it's really going to hurt somebody in some ways the

for people to do and so much fun that they're going to go through and plead that thinking about that

write from somebody else as you say you know so

the only question no i don't

the only question is no i don't you've talked me into that

the problem is if it's harder for them it's also harder for me where's this web

where's this web interface i just get email it's all

to go and i could just inserted so maybe you don't give them access to the weapon or face unless they really need it

so i'm so maybe this is a way out of it you provide something that's

you provide something that's useful for you to do handle

you're done if they do then he provides them access to the website

but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what i'm saying

if they want what i'm saying is that i can't just mail them the password because that's not secure so no but

not secure so they have to call me and ask no but you aren't necessarily giving them

do because of privacy we can't just make it openly available on the web no you're missing

available on the web no you're missing the point

where we're trying to make it less of an obvious just do fall off a log to do this not

this right so not everyone gets a password unless they ask

right so what i would see is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for that not unless they ask

and and we should think carefully actually we should review go through how that's worded

yes someone it wants to review it and

and i know you don't like this so offering this is a suggestion is that we've been given a printout

but the problem with what you're suggesting and then if they say that i have a potential problem in these things and you say we might want to hear this in context and think if you need that you should them the password in the

i would much prefer to have it all be automatic they visit the website if they want to

i know you prefer the problem we

so i think you're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeding and i just don't think that's going to happen have there's a problem

so i think you're thinking people have there's a problem

i'm also concerned about the spirit of the informed consent thing because i think

thing because i think if they feel that it's i you know if it turns

i you know if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't attacked then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that

but they might be able to argue it was cumbersome and i was busy and was going to take me too much time to trace it down so it could be at the

so it could be at the burden would come back on to us some little bit worried

we can go too far in that to us some little bit worried about making it harder for them from a legal standpoint

it seems we can go too far in that direction and need to find somewhere between i think because it harder for them from a legal standpoint

it seems to me that sending them e. mail saying if you haven't so replies a female and say i think because

or we could print up for them i mean could that

i don't know that there's a chance to really skipping that stage

it's the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it so it seems they have the right to have a all right fine fair enough

you're going to grow which like

i mean i don't want to fool them i just

them i just that every at any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a bias that just presented right of i know that's true

if you agree to participate you'll have the opportunity to have anything x. anything exercised which would prefer not to have included in the data set what's

the transcript is available we will ask your permission to include the data and the corpus for the larger research community

there again you'll be allowed to indicate any sections that you prefer to have access from the database and they will be removed

be around it place able send it to you or what it'll

i could it to you or what it'll be available for you on the web or anything

i could probably leave that open how we get it to them i or anything at least more often

they just have to make i mean like morning was saying they

so i think i have an idea that maybe says member satisfied with you i mean this which is it's

it's we just go over carefully how these notes to people that word

right so i just wanted to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impression gives very i mean nothing hidden very strongly the bias there we would really like to use all

it'd be better for are field if that's the case but if you

but if you really think something's going

and then that's my concern about which you know you might be right great i agree
