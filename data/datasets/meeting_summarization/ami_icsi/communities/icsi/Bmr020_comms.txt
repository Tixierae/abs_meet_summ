good the bad knee oakley overlap in
meetings the robust meetings
at all though that's i take it that's something that the dog will look at now that
but i know of another paper that talks about something
so i was going to do that was sixty the transcripts after we the way that we munch them for scoring because
scoring because that's what he cares about and
so but because i can see mari on this so that she knows
so for the thing that we need to give
we can put in the same place just put another directory so i was going to probably put it it
the original versions which you know it's just the random right it was a small difference but
but they probably won't want the originals
a problem because we could use that to find tune our alignment process to make
it wouldn't have been an awkward place to off now sometimes
that about whether the trent the idea transcriber should hear single channel audio or mixed chow audio and
and in a way by having this junk and then the back channel after it's like a faculty stagger makes channel
and she'll just add a mess
least to begin with and just use those meetings to just to send to i b. m. and that he owns interesting you know but the problem though i forget his
least to begin with those meetings to just to send to i b. m. interesting
it really depends
stress test interesting that's directly related to be viet and task be fine
it's not hard and so i
it's not hard and so i
easy enough to do than the game itself role but i have
capital d. but i have another sister in which is since really what this is trying to in the large send the right thing to them and there is going to be this post processing step
that's the promise that's the numbers and get in the papers trust some frame or rate so that's not
they have to you had an advantage for that's the real suspect or something and

both sexes as a submission and you know the paper
you send in late i you first you have to do the but
you send in late i you first you have to do the first one and then but we
i was going to ask five percent of time or five percent of what pretty limited sample here
i was going to ask that too percent of what exactly it's time
you have a lot of two party substances in the meanwhile regardless right
just took the old so this is
that was number that was the second set of the second section and then
what else do we had repeated you know repeated words is another kind of associate and so forth so
and a dash download them if you don't know the finance you can't i mean you can't
right so when one person is speaking there's breaks
size three chong swear actually we can just make one jumped out of that which
it i don't care that you know there's actually a budding segments that we have to join together that's fine
i think but what we do care about is that the beginnings and ends are actually close to the speech inside is that
i think jane tightened these up by hand so
and then the transcriber instead of going painstakingly through all the channels moving the boundaries around and deciding that speech or not but not transcribing anything
the truth they focus on the dominant speaker so what they do they just do that on the main channel
and it just it's just segments of the dominant speak to them for phone sending to i b. m. or basic thing
at least he's not i'm not and ones that really so if you don't have to adjust the bins why
no but it's in that directory right i didn't see where you had jenner
just see if there are any so you do much i mean she listen

don't know i mean that's just something too i just wonder
something i know it's something like that that's i just wonder if you have to normalize but a number of speakers or something we didn't get to look at that
i know it's something like that that's of speakers or something we didn't get to look at that but this obvious
i bet there's but this obvious thing to see if there's a dependence on the number of the participants
and then at the top of the so the different speakers started into their sentence and then someone else started later
so on we found it so
mean they it you know and writing
they it you know and writing you have this two spaces and a big gap you know
are planning and you know we always are planning we're going to say next
but my general goal when there was sufficient space room pause after it to have it be kind of a natural feeling
which i don't know it would be quantify that you know it
and i had about an hour discussion with her about this yesterday we went to
says a whole bunch of words which they can't really do because of the continuity within that person's turned
then the me it be a way of getting to get them a flood of data which
i think we won't know until we generate that's i think that some meetings or would it's special like this
but i'm become kind really tell

do you square brackets running channel too
overlap you know it goes down from maybe for switchboard's goes down from fourteen percent of the too maybe i don't know eleven percent or something it's not a dramatic
and we think that based and that we think that the results are you know ballot although of course some
although of course some air it's going to be in there but
it's to actually measure them wonder but this sort of interesting or
and throughout have other material again and to played
that's the first meeting a couple of versions just to versions
just to check you if there's significant difference and so i but so but for the other meetings
probably about for you to check
and so there wouldn't be a gap afterwards because
is intelligent will is intel's able
us and we'll fix things up and
we should i was things up and some meetings will cost more time to fix up than others
because what i had originally said to brian was they'll have to mark when they can't distinguish between the foreground and background because i thought
so or maybe percentage is the right word but you know how many

so the only agenda items were jane was chain learn to talk about some of the i b. m. transcription process i sort of
lives had sent them a note saying could we please have another two days or something and they said
participant did you identify him as we have now but we read something about
also i in the levinson the pragmatics book and you know textbook there's i found this great florida where he says you know how people that talks about how how people are so good to turn taking and so
and so but they're so good that generally deal that speech does not is less than five percent
in real conversations everyday conversations
i know it's something like that that's of speakers or something we didn't get to look at that but this obvious
but mostly we added one number which was
right so that's so this quick and dirty way of doing access control so
and this i think the styles that i gave you are downtown bolted they are
but just you know again i just want to have an idea of of how much extra you're allowed
it would be quick know it would be kind of quick but the still listening
and then we can sligo's later
there are lots of ways to do i look at it so we just run that one
of a problem because if you're if there's if a word is split that they might have to listen to a few times really understand that they can't quite get it whereas

i sorted is jane as i got this email from
i sorted is jane as i thought being the most relevant person this email from
or we do beat you know vocal track normalization and be
over an entire and be you know we make all the features have i mean given parents
and we just scored a differently
too for the purpose of this analysis we attacked the word sequences and we time alliance and
tech but the tags because we have tag these strings that occurred right before these interrupt locations and the
about the and effect there
to handle those people that call you on the phone and just like to talk and talk and you just have
there's significant difference that's all but so but for the other meetings it's the down type person that you have
it's good you always want to have a little bit of positive on speech around the speech safer recognition purposes
determining if there are any cases of this class of speech as nothing and nothing is speech and
and and adding a tag if that happens so she does just judgment on those guys
and that's what's slow there's no adjusting of time boundaries

right then of course you're going to get a certain hours here and here
and we considered interrupt interrupted occurred in the middle of a word we
the abstract then but at least we put i
so i strike it's eight millimeters and that helped
and that would be the one speaker
and if beach on files focused on the dominant speakers then when it got patched together when it comes back from i. b. m. we can add the back channels
she they it's a question of how much time we want our transcriber to invest here when she's going to have to invest that when it comes back for my b. m. anyway so it's
why we check through a bunch of things by sampling
i didn't mean listen right in others rather than saying we're going to listen to everything
and and in a bad meeting
and then and in a bad meeting or jimmy's where you said always had some problems was that me so
is i mean five percent fifty percent
i counts really side don't have freely or numbers i think that's really

and then just i only have like this afternoon and maybe tomorrow morning to get anything done before i go to japan for ten days
help but i can't christopher axle something and you offered to drive me too
and you just have this little detector that listens for these drops in pitching gets in the back channel
but i haven't said i did because actually my
worries kilos won't have that
so what we're probably going to do is just write a script that if too chung this are very close to each other on the same channel will just merge them interesting
so and i will get around the problem of the you know one word deep one word deep one word beat clever
it's it so there these chunks that look like that have
it you sounds normal it's as if
transcriber will do it so what involved is really is the original per procedure but it
we take but only applied to certain strategically chosen this aspect of the data so

really do most of it so yes right several people sent this
which both across the same
almost identical in fact
this is way more than five percent
did i mean tastes like face to face or
also but five percent of time or five we have pretty limited sample here
so it's not against his conclusion it just says it's it so that's still but still
i'm it's not a real strong one
it on and cease away you hesitate or where you start to repair or
i'm my name my impression is that it's better for meetings with fewer speakers and it's better
and it's better for the meetings then nobody's breeding

have a reference for that though you do
so in my recalling correctly anyway so
in the back channel so then you put that to the phone and go off and
nasal award you know
exactly what you describe it for japanese
i made a directory i called it's
he still has his unix account here you know
and he's i judge meeting but but he has to he
i judge meeting recorder yet he preferred he said he
and so i figured that he's the best approach so what i did
and goes until minutes on so and then mark

bad knee oakley in terms of number words and also
go against that kind of claim you have to do a big canvassing he made a claim
i wanted to i wanted how much extra would you allow allowing most
without really stopping mean
i also at the same time she when she goes through this she'll be if there's anything that was in coated as a pas but really has something transcribe oval and it then she's going to make a mark
just based on your site precipitation that's the
but then we could so it's only in certain here and there then would that be something that would be just as efficient to do at this end instead of having to go through i b. m. than be patched together then be double checked here right
be yes or no but it would be quick i don't know it
but it would be quick i don't know it
have one program that will do it you can find other programs i use

real some fixed the transcripts and numerous ways
re including to up l. so the recognize it didn't have the benefit of annoying where the foreground speech and started
files so that someone can get that's fine and then though the finance and therefore download them if you don't
because i tighten of time benson that's also
great idea and then we're going to do the beep defy on both and listen to them and see if we notice any real differences
know one thing that prevented us from apply you from applying exactly
but in which case the gap between these two complete some tactic it's which course spoken things are not always complacent actively but
that's interesting that's directly related or not and it just is a little interface which will probably yes is it then that will be the final be fine
and i we could just indicate to the transcribers not too and coat that if they could

on channel four you're getting a lot of breath i was just
on t. closures homely so
just put another directory it i make another directory make it that make
then create something just in him and
saturday battery to make it more accurate
u. s. no digits you start with a piece imitation
i didn't mean listen everything i'm at
everything i'm at just see if there are any good so you do much i mean she listen to a little

you know you want to it's at the end but it's in the beginning it's
jeeze upper lower case also opera
definitely they should have the full bandwidth version
because i mean i think just decided to go ahead with that don't sample versions because we can because it's like a significant difference but it takes a less
like a significant difference it does think about if they if but it takes a less decipher likely
about if they make it even better than the original versions which right
and you know then they'll send us back we what they sent back to us and we'll fix

in this paper though for instance that morgan accounted for fifty six percent of the robust this meeting in terms of number for it
section and then the other thing was we looked at what we call interrupts although that's that
three words from the and so the question was how can we what can we say about the places where the second store or actually several second speakers start there interrupted to call them
no right i see just a statistical correlation
and he lives in japan now and he did this
that's how some on some meanings it's good that sounds like a good idea such as you say if to do together and then
that's how some on some meanings it's good that sounds like a good idea such as you say if to

we can say the word zero all we watch but i'm doing some
opera or case no we only use you
think it would be if they had it the same set so that when they
set so that when they did experiments they could compare right but they don't
now the i'm knitting so in fact this might suggest an alternative sort of a hybrid between these two things so
now the i'm knitting suggest an alternative sort of a

it's still not a good idea so it's not that bad if
it's still not a good idea so it's not that bad if it's at the end but it's
and certainly we could do that but small phone
and we looked at this in terms of
just so that while i'm gone you can regenerate generated if you decide to do it a different way
me making it on yours i just wanted to get it so do you have like in swimming in a big band that it's no i don't actually i it's that's fine because we don't want to

so either we should regenerate the original versions where we should make a note of that like
that was taken more time i just wanted to get no i don't
three and and the previous version and that which is use now that the bechtel of would be in between there's more so that i see
it's not that different what is
we start with your pre segment version and i'm leaving
we start with your pre segment version and i'm leaving

it's not that different in terms of the this new procedures suggesting what is e.
so i'm a little confused because how
so what they do is they down to five who was on a speaker and when the speaker starts
there's the question of weather i b. m.
so that's not really what will be effective for the transcribers it's
so the beach came on the speech that is missed by it that detector for a good meeting i is around i'm not one person that would say but that

but any help you need i can certainly provide that's great
said we all said nodded at the same time so just right but even if you
although that's that maybe a misnomer but
i was just double check with brian on a few simple conventions on how they should mark things than others
when they when there's either no speech in there or

that's interesting so
but there's no adjusting to everything
or something they don't understand things like that
we sit in and what is it you think
is it could meaning what you think you know that the meeting was a good meaty right

it just says it's it be bell curve in that you have something that has a range yourself like so there are slight their differences
are slight their differences in how you measure it but still it's
but still it's you know the difference between between that number and quickly having meetings which is more
to do just that takes you know it just takes five minutes rather than taking a second so right except
so i just had heard coded it right except i don't think that thick these instructions

so if there's anything that desperately needs to be done should let me know now
help but i can't really do most of it so to drive me too yes right several people sent this
one participant we have now but we
so we should perhaps trust this that you were saying that they differ and how they work depending on channel subsist systems and it when it comes back anyhow

first one and then we actually exceeded be delayed deadline by another day so
they had some extension thing now is lives had sent them
justice this the i really i want to in that one
help but thing christopher axle something and you offered to drive me

relevant have did you look at the u. r. l. i think so too
by the way who's on channel four you're
it doesn't sound like the person
in some cases there are some people who have very long segments of discourse where you know they'll breed and then i put a break

which is essentially a stretch of speech with no pauses succeeding saffron millisecond
it made me think to see the reference too
it made me think about that little device that could be built to
right but they don't have a recognize recognizing

what sort of normalization do you do so
of data which would be useful when it comes back to us
and it really is is intelligent and they listen to each section and say yes no whether that section is
it so we just run that j. sounds that

and keep p. record all i'll probably move from there as so we could
one word deep one word beat clever
excellent in fact after our meeting this morning people came in and said that there could be other differences between the already transcribed meeting with the beach and it and one that has just been run through his process so
two so he's going to run his process on that same meeting

that's so important to know so
we should probably you know xenon down several versions
do it that way the way that they have with the longer not having to fuss with
i think we just have to listen to it and see how good they are meetings i'm it i'm

transcriber will do it so what involved is it
the channels i just throw all the channels i b. m.
i mean as long as on the other hand they can say there's something conventions that they say
it's perhaps time and steps five percent of something which some

and other sorts of acoustic problems they and they may
so that they should only write down the transcript if they're shore and otherwise they should market
otherwise they should market so that we can check market diverse you know
we have been told ability convention and actually they have

so that can be when it's really impressive channel
but i think it's less of a problem most listeners
just wasted time
now what about in a meeting that you said receive has more trouble

smell a lot i think kirk curly brackets
curly kirk curly brackets a voice john boy curly
curly brackets right a voice john boy curly brackets out

poor transcribers
to i wanted it to be able to he be heard normally most
and then we have somebody's going to just all the time boundaries and we send a bag and the other

i was just looking on i did have
change what in the summer anyway change that in the software where
right because you right because not everybody talks

like you just don't like if you if it starts catching heroes like in the driver or something
i'm not looking forward to it he's still it's
looking forward to it's a high signal noise ratio

hardware where if you're seeing zero come across one channel you should add some least for like
it's to actually measure them wonder sort of interesting or
this and then we found we were at six pages when we started

and we computed how many overlapped sports there where and how many overlap whereas that were four different corpora
i went so this training meeting i is that some data where we have very you know accurate time marks for
when we went to

be meeting recorder meetings the robust
and that he owns you know but the problem though i forget his
though i forget his problems little town or

everyday conversations what
of course not doesn't necessarily what these conversation alice i've been studying for years and years or
and then we looked at locations where

i mean you're recognize we just we do you know the two
i'll go through and the substitute and come and get it so that it's clear that those are the other kind of gory just you know recoding
open to that yes it's working

returns or winded over the entire channel
over the entire channel
know i'm now we didn't rerun the it for this we

tag which says actually
and it's part so whether there was a pause essentially here because births are
because births are defined as being you know siphon millisecond so longer pauses

it's really impolite if you don't and
wouldn't have times time i think i'm really tending towards
i mean what's the worst that happens

after check that was going to be a good thing
it's. d. p. hobbs
the same as the mailing us and

have stan ls r. t. r. d. r. r. right
a bowl it's only accessible so
so in other words to access anything under there you have to be told what the name is

through his process so tomorrow when we go to make the jumped file for i b. m. we're going to actually compare the two so he's going to run his
so far we haven't
so i just had heard coded it right except i don't think that thick these instructions for doing that was in that directory right i

sort of a compromise and
we went to e. d. you wanted some extent
send it to him it sounds like it's almost always right there's not any big problem you send it to

also use i think something around syrup on five seconds for this becomes that should occur so the minimum and it's also base i mean it is just that value based on the distribution of pause times that you see in switchboard and another corpora
my nifty capital d. but i
and background because i thought that was going to be the most prevalent

the only disadvantage disadvantages that is then it's hard to use an automatic method to do that
these vantages that it's probably faster to do that than it is to use the dionna made method and correct it
will just have to see i can't i think you know the original plan was that the transcriber would adjust to set boundaries and all that for all the channels but

channels but you know that is so time consuming and since
consuming and since we have a bottle like here we want to get i. b. m. things are usable is as soon as possible then the
so or maybe percentage is the right

on so and then mark pass can comes in
and he starts it minute such and such an goes on
an goes on till minutes on so

in the game students who getting the coefficients for each
it's probably in the paper that i have that lately but
you know to take this test is speech but it's not

order magnitude notion of
notion of how on a good meeting how often do you get segments that come into work and so forth and and in a
was that me so i mean just one of these i mean one percent ten percent is i mean

in the car or somewhere in the hardware where if you're
all right then i'll hold off on that and i for you to

dave gilbert send me email i think it to you too that there's a special topic section and sick and your speech on new corp corporate
and it's not due until like may fifteenth this

so i thought it was highly relevant have did you look i think so too
don't don't say or adopting that

i haven't gotten there yet but what
justice this the there yet but what our discussion yesterday i really i want to in that one

there were some interesting results in this paper though for instance
but i don't know if that's really maybe ten percent so in terms of in other words it's like seventeen or eighteen percent for the meeting recorder meetings and about half that for restless

and in terms of what number for
that's just the talks really fast do you mean no

that rick just overall volume no according to the transcript
all but you're intending to stop for fifty seven millisecond right

no we identify met the person dominating the conversation
i bet there's a week dependence i'm it's

other than that though was result what was the rest of the paper
he said it i haven't seen yet it was about it had three sessions

i'm surprised one little unexpected result there is that two party telephone conversations have about the same amount of overlap of
i had better start changing all my slides of interest you know order of magnitude wise as as face to face meetings with multiple

or was it like meetings which is more like you know close to the news like these you know close to twenty percent that
but or was it like same nervousness meaning for instance that

meaning it was about half of the so
and we send a bag and the other one is we just run his thing and intended i. b. m. there's a

said we all said channels so you might think that back child so special status because essentially just
to the phone and go off and do the do whatever you wanted do all that thing keeps him busy

the house and then the second one was just the we had and the sheltie paper and how overlaps affect the recognition performance
and the idea that these units would be generated for the donna speakers and maybe not for the other channels

so that the conjecture from the and so t. results was that most of the at it recognition areas from infections due to background speech
surprise me because with a close talking mikes the signal will be so much stronger right

that's right bouncing working hard
right it right so we took the old recognition output and we just scored

and i must say that miss scoring tools are pretty for this away
like i can't type anything

that's somewhat that's how much subject hour but still we
but still we don did some have hand checking

there but what we found us after we take out these regions so we only score the reasons that were certified as foreground speech recognition i went down to almost the level austin on overlapped speech
i that doesn't even though there's this back

i mean you're recognize or any answer recognize the two
or any answer recognize or we do

and did the did to the problems with without going also or it
for answers and it did not certain i mean not completely but yes

for answers and it did not certain i mean not completely but yes
before and i said i send email so

we only use you know here it's question marks and information and we
call also or not a lot of them but it's

somewhere in between these comedy for yes so
for so the such that there was overlap between the two sons so

that boundaries and
and then we had things like this course markers

disowned seas
phil pause

we had both the beginnings and of disease
so the end of the film pause

and the end of the discourse marker
just eyeballs i mean we didn't really hand tag all of these things we just

of these things we just look at the distribution of words and so every
and so every so and and we're the we're deemed to be back jones and

right in the back childhood so easily just based on the mexico identity of the words we attack them it's one of these things
and of course the dictator option ponds we got from the original transcript

in other words if you weren't going to pause you will because you're being interrupted where did
right no statement about and effect is

but then talking and so you've
and so you've paused for a second so

pick out white space i you know that the gap between
pick out white space i you know that the gap between the two columns like ten millimeters so i

all that thing keeps him busy there's actually a business
there's actually a business that former student of here from berkeley nasal

describe it for japanese and
and forgotten in japanese is really important that you back so it's

civilized people i think you could just sort of like you know continuously
it wouldn't matter know continuously pretty much be fine

so what i did is i i made a new directory
actually on this directory is not to read a bowl it's

i know and then in there i have a file that lists all the other files so that
meetings so it's not that her son that just but

i make another directory make it that make another directory done
just put another directory it i make another directory make it that make another directory done

just the random it was a small difference but
we spread talk about the idea and transcription press and

you should probably talk about that but you were going
that but you were going to use the usually transcribe file because i tighten of time

benson that's also the one that they had already and trying to do by the first changes this
it yet but it sounded very good and i understand that you

my understanding was that
i haven't listened to it yet but it sounded very

i went back and had more t. but depends on which i mentioned that marks for
and i'm not exactly how that would work with it with the back channels

that'll only be if it's the background speaker
so you'll have a chunk of you know channel hey which starts at zero and ten and

right i mean so i mean what i would i was interested in this having a having time marks so the beginnings and ends speech
that's definitely by each speaker

me making it on yours it so do you have like in swimming actually i it's that's fine
me making it on yours it so do you have like in swimming actually i it's that's fine

in a big band that it's because we don't want to
that's what you fine in fact

that but my main goal is in these areas where you have a three way overlap and one of the overlaps involved and it's swimming in this huge been i wanted to get it so that it was quote more closely localized right
but i we talking about i don't know tenth of a second

that you know it she says that introducing narratives of spurts of people use tend to be that what would be a pause might be something like two seconds
that i hand i'm i have just the two of them i mentioned

i send email something so at some point we will try to find humor in our first alignments maybe
something at some point we will try to find humor in our first

alignments maybe using those as preferences because
you know what you would do is he would play with different parameters and

parameters and to get an object you need an objective measure of how closely you can align the models to the actual speech
and that's where your data would be

it makes a lot of sense in terms of transcription
in terms of transcription it would be easy to do it that way the way

that would you could have one having to fuss with adding these units
you could have one like if there is bechtel in between those the things the than

q. so the idea initially was we get for the new meetings so the e. d.
so far discussed it with one with

and it occurred to me is that that's what we have in this kind of a format is you could consider as a staggers mixed file we had some discussion or
we had some discussion or the weekend of about at this other meeting that we are i that

and it occurred to me and my discussion with her yesterday that
the maximum gain it's from the i b. m. people maybe in long stretches of connected speech says

and certainly things that are intrusions of multiple words taken out of context and just placed in time from where they occurred that would be hard so
so my thought is i'm having this transcriber go through the e. d. one meeting and indicated start time for each thomas speaker and put in time for each on the speaker and the idea that these

just you know recoding but
but the transcriber events that i'm considering and that's that continue to be laugh as speech and cough and things like that so i'm not stripping

that so i'm not stripping out of anything just
out of anything just you know being very lenient what's considered speech

we take the easy part to the data and the data so you got
and the transcriber marks it by hand you got it

after i didn't understand that yes
i mean i'm confused

they leave the mics on and so
leave the mics on and just put them on the table

so i you know so and you do you one as far as i listened to it you start off with that this section by jerry so jerry
by jerry so jerry starts at minute so and so

but then we could trust use the up to this detector and do the keeping on it depends on the time in
without having to check anything

on some meanings it's good could such as you say if to do together and then
mean the detectors this that you i mean we have to fix it when it comes back anyhow

i think we won't know until we generate a bunch of beat files automatically listen to them and see how bad they are it's special like this we won't be able to see included
they are we won't be able to see included with this first thing because there's

do it you can find other programs i use it so we just run that j.
just see if there are any good do much i mean she listen to a little bit here and there

but if we send them without editing that we're also going to have a notations for words that are cut off
but what we would like them to do is be conservative so that they should only everything

problems they do already and they may just at what those cutoff words are but
but what we would like cutoff words are but let me we're going to adjust everything

sipping record

correction for transcribers eric darn

there's going to be some zeros from this morning's meeting because i noticed that very

very i think maybe you turned your might cost before the digits always enduring digits

you know you want to keep them on so you get good noise it's

change what in the summer where like you just don't

certainly we could do that but i don't think it's a good idea we can do that post

we can do that post processing if the a petition needs it postal i

it postal system i actually don't

it postal system i actually don't know what the default is anymore how we're using the friend and but for when we used to actually friend and but

an argument there isn't there is an option in austin which

then when i first put it in like amazing actually wrote things i did actually put in a random dancer so there was and but

so there was and but then i realized that putting in random bit was equivalent to adding adding flat spectrum and

and it was a lot faster just at a constant to the into the spectrum so i just started doing that instead of calling

doing that instead of calling rand or something

i sort of condensed the three things you said into that and then

and you just sent off there's these paper

i hope they accept that i mean

and they said yes

that and said that i say three and four yes

is apart like it correctly identified words

that rick just overall volume no according to the transcript

that rick regardless i think it's he's in all of them i mean we didn't

in all of them and he talks a lot i mean we didn't mention morgan my name produce

one participant we have now but we

did you identify him as a senior member we read something about no we identify

r. p. things in nazi releasing

two kinds of results euro

good the the one was that the just the amount of overlap

of number words and also we computed something called a sport which

and found of compare the numbers

and found that the

know as you might expect the meeting recorder me for the most overlap

but next worse which one call home which both across the

and the russians meeting for i believe so

had i had better start changing all my slides to face meetings with multiple also

of course not doesn't necessarily go against what he said because he said years and years or

also but what he said because he said generally speaking in order to go against that kind of claim you have to do a big canvassing we have he made a claim

so it's not against his conclusion it just says it's it so that's still but still

but i don't know if that's really fair way of comparing between multi party conversation's and to party conversations restless

i don't know i mean that's just sensitive too

it's an interesting was all regardless so right and

all regardless right and then and we all said computed this both with and without back channels so

time so but even if you take out all the back channels so

so you treat back channels last month speeches pauses you

you still have significant overlap you know

it's not a dramatic change so

that was one set of the house and then the second

and we read scored things a little bit more carefully real some

what if you school or ignoring all so

we scored all their recognition results in such a way that the

getting a lot of breath i was just wondering

so if you have the foreground speaker speaking here and then there's some background speech maybe overlapping it somehow

and this is the time then that we used

right so we scored everything and i

you just ignore everything outside of the reaching that was deemed to be foreground speech and where

and where that laws we have to use that to forced alignment results from four so

that's great so that means that even if you do have background speech if you can somehow separate outdoor find where it is the recognize it does a good job

i that doesn't surprise me because there's this back

over an entire returns or over

right so this is actually a sub optimal way of doing it right so we took the

re including to up l. speech and started yes

i mean still i should bring that should bring the table with results that we can look at it

i would presume that you still that we can look at it

i would presume that you still would have somewhat higher error with the repel friends herschensohn yes it's

i'm not looking forward to it because again looking forward to the non close my case i think that he's still it's

that helps you right

misnomer but we look at cases where

so we used to punctuation from the original transcripts and

and we inferred the beginnings and the sentence

i mean we miss a lot of them but

if you have overlapping speech and someone else starts sentence you know where do these where do other people start their turns not turns really but you know sentences

so we only look at cases where there was a foreground speaker

somewhere in between the startling in and so what

the startling in and so what

three words from the and them

we you know consider that to be interrupt as i said where at the beginning of the war it so that

war it so that if any part of the word was overlapped that was considered to interrupted word

and then we looked at the location of the you know the features that the tags because we

and the tag and we looked at our this perch tag which

back channels

so disowned the d.'s are for the interruption part of it on and cease away

and and so and rights word that's right in the back childhood

so and then we look at the distance so we looked at the

we looked at the these distribution have of these or different kinds of tag @reject@ overall

and or and with the because they have to use her an option of points and

i wonder you know

i wonder you know it's it's not no big surprise this but this

right no right i see and effect is just a statistical correlation

you were intending to pause at all but right

when we started cutting and

and to played with a latex and

made font smaller and hours wonder fun smaller and until it's that i would

made font smaller and fun smaller and until it's

the do you can really make everything smaller but at least we

the abstract then but at least we put i

there wasn't and that helped them and like that

there wasn't there some result under s. i thought like that

s. i thought maybe liz presented this at some conference awhile ago about back channels

and that they tend to happen when the pitch drops you know falling

you know falling pitch

and so that's when people tend to back channel that

you right we didn't talk about because i like properties at all though

we're going to be looking at that look at now that we have the data and we have the alignment so

we're going to be looking at that look at now that we have the data and we have the alignment so

this is purely based on you know the words and

i didn't know about mrs finding on that

he did the system and he

now and he did this back channeling automatic back sending system so very

random what i do

there was there random intervals what i do

there was of course the monty python sketch with that for intervals

the barber who was afraid of scissors was playing a tape of clicking sound sensei

how about them sports teams

so the papers online and

i think i if you see the message to meeting recorder with your are they can

no one would think so i'm actually about to send is three any e. thing where you can find the that material he wanted for this for the speech recognition experiment so

because actually my desktop locked up like i can't

is it the same directory that so if there's any suggestions jeff what i was just going to send them to

it the same directory that you had suggested them to i made a directory

i judge meeting recorder yet he preferred he said he would prefer f. t. p. and

and also the other for some that wants to there's one person in sri he wants to look at you know it that we have so far and so

real hobbs

have stan ls r. t. r. d. r.

and the directory for this i call that i. s. r. zero point one because it's sort

i don't know here's this meeting because it's sort this meant for recognition

i don't know here's this meeting i know this meant for recognition and then

don't don't say and a dash or adopting i mean you can't that

and also and then the way farms that don segment that i mean

i that i mean just taught them all up i mean for each meeting i taught them all into one tar file and she's just them and stick in there

i the digits in my own home directory home and keep p. record all in there

so we could point mari to this also for her march one request march on

you never she was what she she wanted that also

we need to give brian the beep file so i was going to probably

we can put in the same place so i was going to probably put it

that's the first because in one directory does two versions

it does think about if they if decipher likely

do i think we're losing dawn and then dress at three thirty right good thing that

book it was good to have endurance these things but so

you know that adam created script to generate the beat file too

it was good and i understand that you guys were going to have a meeting today before this meeting

it was just to talk about how to generate it this meeting

so chalk auntie low should now more or less know how to generate the filing i think

i think chuck pointed out is that since this one is hand marked there are discourse boundaries right so

trying so that is a training meeting

what i would just want to see if there are any major differences between doing it on the hand

interesting

on which i mentioned that last week but

the but there's but there's this one issue with them and that there are time boundaries in there that occur in the middle of speech because

that's on the other channel my i was listening to the original file that habits like you hear word in your beep and then you hear the continuation of what is the same sentence

that's on the other channel that's the same sentence

because the channel overlapped

and that's not going to be true the foreground speaker that'll only be if it's the background

then the same channel starting at eleven ending

at eleven ending of fifteen and

and then again starting in sixteen ending it

sixteen ending it twenty right

that which is a zero twenty

that was so if you were to use these you have to be careful not to part of these individuals i mean it right i mean

that's definitely a problem because we

these up by hand that's much better so what is that sort of how tight out they

that's much better what is that sort of how tight out they

they were reasonably tight but not excruciating like tight

so that i can interpret the numbers if i compare that with the forced alignment sanitation

i wanted to i wanted would you allow allowing most

so that if you play back that and have it in the mode where it stops at the boundary it sounds like a normal word it doesn't sound like the person

normal it's as if a person could have stopped there

now sometimes you know i see these are involved in places where there was not time and

but other than that it's really pretty continuous and this includes things like

and this includes things like going from one sense into the when i turns into the next one sense of the next

but some people are planning and you

actively but it would be a shorter break then maybe you might like but

you might like but their goal there was to not have thee text be so crudely parsons time than me because

time than me because from a discourse purpose it's more it's more useful to be able to see and also

to see and also you know from a speech recognition purpose my impression is that if you have too long a unit it's doesn't help you very much either because of the memory

so that means that d. amount of time after something is variable depending partly in context but my general goal

the discourse the people who look at turn taking off and use i was interested that you chose

i was interested that you chose the you know the use because i think that's a unit that

i think that's a unit that would be more consistent with sociolinguistics

we chose you know half a second because

because if you go much larger you have you know your statement about how much overlap there is becomes less precise because you

because you include more actual pause time into what you consider overlapped speech

and it's also base i mean

it's also base i mean it is just that value based on the distribution of pause times that you see in switchboard and another corpora

occur so the minimum silence line i see

in any case this meeting that i hand i'm

and hopefully the new meetings which was from the travelling through from we'll better time boundaries elements

i like this idea of for our purposes for the idea in preparation having these join together

the than the actual look for at the end off those three and yes

that's right but you know this brings me to the other stages that you discuss so he earlier today which is

today which is the second stage is what to do in terms of the transcribers adjustment of the state i discuss

of the state i discuss this with you

so the e. d. u. meetings that tivo had it has no pre segmented all of them force on channel by child basis and

so i've assigned i've assigned them to our transcribers and

so what i'm thinking and it maybe that not all meetings will be good for this but what i'm thinking is that indie do you meetings they tend to be driven by a couple of dominant speakers

it seems to me that you know back channels per se wouldn't be so hard but then

wouldn't be so hard but then there's this question of the time marking and whether the beeps would be a and i'm not exactly

you know so that been would be marked as it as double dots

and in the other any other case if it's marked a speech and really there's nothing transcribe one and then she's going to put his dashing i'll go through and

confused because how do we know where to put beeps is it is

transcriber so what is it

and because no but after we've done to those

mark u. s. no digits you start with a piece we start with the pre segment tape version

mark u. s. no digits you start with a piece imitation tape version

instead of doing that which was our original plan the truth they focus on the dominant speaker they just do that on the main channel

and precipitation that's the basic thing

exactly i don't so now jane my question is when they're all done adjusting the time boundaries for the dominant speaker have they then also he raced the time boundaries for the other ones

that's why she's not getting start then points of the donna seekers so

and then meanwhile she's listening to both of these guys channels determining

and adding a tag if that happens so she does just judgment on those guys

that meeting but you know i want to say his segment is so good that the part that i listen to with her yesterday didn't need any adjustments the bins

this is not going to be a major part of the process at least he's so if you

at least he's not i'm not and ones that really so if you don't have to adjust the bins why not just do it for all the channels i just

i think we just have to listen to it and see how good they are meetings i'm it i'm

mean the detectors this that you were saying that they i mean we have to fix it when it comes back anyhow

so we should perhaps trust select meetings on which the speech on speech addiction works and just systems and but he was great

select meetings on which the but he was great

these two things so the one suggestion is you know we run kilos thing and then we have somebody's going to

m. there's a another possibility if we find that there are some problems in

and are some problems in that is the go ahead and we just run his to me generate to be filed and we have somebody listen to the beeps file and

will intel's able or not and it

no interesting i mean i wouldn't be that much fun for transcribers that they're here it be yes or no but i don't

but quick but the still listening to everything

no adjusting of time boundaries

wouldn't have times time i don't know i think i'm really tending towards i mean what's the

worst that happens the transcribers i mean as long as on

that's true we can just later it

that's true we can just catch it at catch everything at decide it

how interesting that maybe that's a you know just

and it just depends on how what you do you

and it just depends on how what you do you

very good so i can save you one is good enough maybe we can included

maybe we can included in this set of this we send

thing because there's a part of the process of the beef file which requires knowing the normalization coefficients and

no but it's easy enough to do than jenner but i have

easy enough to do than the game itself role but i have

like don't look at it ten so we just

maybe have an order it's probably

i see the characteristics right and so was almost it was almost always doing the right thing i went to get

i went to get some sense what almost always meant

word but you know how many per minute

that's just my amount of speech i'm not

i did this on four meetings and only five minutes a full fire him you know if these meetings so

which some of the frames speech france which i miss but i'm

so it sometimes you might want to go back and look at it more in terms of how many times is there's bert that's interrupted

and the promise when it on the breath he wants where you get reading back into indicated speech that

that if they could still do the p. file again i think that is probably less

that if they could still do the p. file again i think that is probably less of a problem because

if they listen to it and there's don't hear any speech i think they probably just listen to it once so that you'd think
