was the last week or whatever
so what i was started playing with was again this h. t. k. back and
and in the first round they do i think it's three iterations and
maybe i should write on the board so
write on the board so there's four rounds of training
and the final thing so i had done
i ran a couple of experiments where i reduced that's to be three two five i think and i got almost
i mean it's like one little exile you had to change those numbers
and you don't do anything else and then you just run
five i'll hold double check it was
it makes a big difference so
that's so we could do a lot more experiments and throw a lot more in there
the other thing that i did was i compiled the h. t. k. for the linux boxes so we have
so we have this big thing we got from i. b. m. which is
that's score and then you can look at
they could do it just when you get all done i think that they probably i was
so just for example so suppose
because if some of the people didn't to have the idea at all i right and
have no idea because of the sharper that west with a very simple speakers traction approach
then the computer difference differences and one is something if you want

she i can't remember now what happens is that first one i have
i think the hope would be that it would it would work for the good cases and
is it that you're supposed to do better than and i
the latency so much harder
put the graffiti
but that's definite
might be that i mean what where we are coming with feature sets after all
it's another way of looking at is that the mail caps or no spectrum l. catch term any of these variance give you this food spectrum suspect
each one of them extra components i mean you have
i think giving their interpretation so we i
so we have one pint for one energy for each feature bank which is i see
some the differences to eat some see like that
i mean you could argue about whether she enter place interplay center or r.'s or if order but

so not try to combine them
but matched just not actually clean what
like those speed and or
and that's you could argue that's a pretty realistic situation and
it since they have these three categories it seems like a reasonable thing to do is to go across the languages and to come up with an improvement for each of those
say in the highly match case this is what happens in the
on my which is should be darko point propose i won but with the construction addition
and it seems that the minimize on and disorder when you inspector subtraction
it's like ten percent remedy
so if this good systemic good g. e. d.
we have the fifty so we just so it's not really
domain so that would be like in addition in bog respect and i

except that actually for the silence model it's six extras per state
one i have to look it up and see
each one is going to have a different characteristic
to the question is you average the relatives improvements or do you average their rates and take a relative improvement you have that
so you know i could argue strongly something like the media mismatch which is you know not pathological but
and i mismatched that happens and
and the parents be some people are pushing too to keep just sixty percent number so
it's i you just this one point of the conference calls so but
i think that would be good i mean it's not that the design
i mean it's not that the design of the v. a. d. isn't important
the post rain

i mean it seems like there's a simple way
this seems like an obvious steak or something that they're
and you know these other systems we help it out quite a bit but still there's
but there is probably a big change that to be made is that
be made is that the bays dying they want to have a new byzantine perhaps
is just thing as a baseline we know that
as a baseline we know that
it but at least you have a starting point it's
it seems like you should try to make your baseline is good as possible and if
if things are somewhat better in proposal to further matched case and someone worse
typically no like which

is really what i meant
i considerations the first one
so i had done some experiments where was i want to play with the number of mixtures but
so and it's a real
and it's a real simple change to make i mean it's like
so it's a very simple change to make and it doesn't seem to
make and it doesn't seem to hurt all that much
five at a time it runs as fast as you know five different machines
so if they don't know doesn't that suggest a way for them to go
just it's someone told that perhaps it's not fair to do that because and to make a good g. e. d. you don't have enough to with that the features that the business teacher so

b. m. which is five processor machine
machine and you can run five at a time it
and i was going to test to see which friend and that i want to do is i would
but it's just that it does seem to be a lot of to do a good job on that as as
that as as being a lot of work to do a good job in the future design so
cut down on that if we can make some progress
having the baseline b. d. m. cici's means that people could choose to pour their effort into trying to do really good v. a. d. i don't but they seemed like two
and i think that the still makes i still think it's makes sense as a baseline
you do these summa try to understand when you do the same
phoniness and i mean what i'm arguing is that's give you gives you your intuition

but it's there's a mismatch between the car conditions and that's
we're still testing so we have the results forum just teachers we are
but having using those limits juicy chose
we just no so it's not really an expectation but it's something
and saying if you have them on to the future actors that make things better or worse annoys where you really
just it the way i'm looking at is not so much trying to find the best world's best voice tone voiced across the fire but it's more that
but it's more that you know try some
but it's more that you know try some different statistical characterization so that difference back to the raw data and
just why we stopped it took by having set of voice phoniness and that's true what arguing is that i mean what i'm arguing is that

it goes from
but for the other languages they combine improvements
how should that be done
number so they want at least fifty percent improvement on the baseline
i think specter subtraction and gets you ring and online on my which is
the various just great mean like i don't know
correlation but i mean sort of first order for speech recognition you say i don't care about the source right in customs
but i mean sort of energy right and she just want to find out

i is this related to the issue that you brought up a couple of meetings ago with the musical tones in
and then they could do sits down and so we put the old faithfuls
which is should be i have four films
and yet you and you're not getting the expectation anyway you know so
we had to spend that would dig twenty she he said that them and picked up on
so this is it seldom know caps term is the caps term of this the suspect rumor like spectrum whatever
and the way to do days is that but we have to have
they should be more close act like i

we did it again morgan
i have something just fairly brief to report on
i was curious because the way that they train up the models they go through about four sort of rounds of training
so that's all fine
what you're saying is that when you do these summa
the stand these glasses send it and it always days prepping fishing
of both and it would be a multiplication in frequency domain so that would be

so spectra subtraction
so we have this kind of new restaurants just them which use a clean don't think of sampling we
and very emphasis this
especially if these trainings and so forth it faster and almost just take a scatter shot at a few different ways of look of characterizing that difference and
i mean i know that people doing summer bestest things joyce back we're just doing just being gross destroying and you fifty and actually it wasn't
they took the nation to be teamed up like he's gift four days giant i younger that seems to that used to tell younger think that
and for on the hardest it's something that's more that

april fifth
i mean the fact is inconsistent just not this mistake but the or something that they're
you know the thing is that if you look at the numbers on the more difficult cases if you really believe that was going to be the predominant use none of this would be good enough nothing anybody
i mean when we put the new around at work and we'd
we you how did you get your voice and voice truth state
fishing and because still hounded i'm picked it so

this end of the world is really what i meant
right this is the mix up that makes up right
as opposed to what sixteen hours or something like that
to two sites i have to look to see what the exact numbers were i thought it was like
but it's so much faster
a difference there's just this world is so if you look at the specter on the love just the very smooth properties of it you get something closer to that and then is it was

quite get that there's this foreigner seven i'm
that's right and the and so in the final one here you end up with for all of the digit words you end up with three mixtures per state
we can run on so together with the fact we've got these faster linux boxes and that it takes less time to do these we should be able to crank they're a lot more experiment
of separate unfortunately this coupling between them which is part of it
like on the trucks that
that in fact the data itself is she working with is not perfect so

and then give you a score here's a score and then
here's or a romance case and here's
but how much worse since the waiting might change how much worse is
so we have the mess scissor bank we have the fifty so
so there's because it would be game i mean fifteen find the fifty employees
so it's it's there's a period the city of this signal say something about the pitch

except the various just great you exit the variance inspector encouraging right
force both for the the reason they're overlap and then you know structural reasons
it's not part of a v. a. d. system that you're doing
i think giving their interpretation to sort of like a rectangle that's it that
both to such an addictive and
both it seems that an addictive and

so what happens is at each one of these points you increase the number of doubts into the model
i mean it takes you have to do an overnight the way it is set up now so it's
i mean it takes you have to do an overnight the way it is set it's
and the things it's not just your average because it these waiting's
you know figure out how to combine the scores with

goes base nineties already very good and
what was the media mismatch condition again
it's a of worse
you put thing your on the torque compared to and not having any you're on the truck
so picture what does it look like friendly

in there but i think they started off this process with a notion that you should be significantly better than the previous standard
and you would like that to be the case
them in the triangle that's right so you end up with of victor that's the same length as the fifty actor and then this and to the theater then
what i've been said what i that makes sense
which is for selling the post rain

with you and so they said you know i should have half so or something that you had before so
half so or something that you
it does seem like it's more logical to combine them first and then do
that the training and testing or somewhere the training and testing
but no so you should those other conditions very you know really small

they can be with a relative improvement first and then average that
and then average that with the waiting
and so then the that makes the highly matched the really big thing
so mostly the idea is
it may be that you're finding something good and that the variance

is run it's this program called h. e. rest
happens in the so they can medium insist happens and i mismatched
suspect trauma blocked
by going back to the s. f. t. you're getting something that is more like the raw data

and even if we don't do anything else doing something like this could allow us to turn experiments around a lot faster
thing beautiful for one and when you have a final thing would go back to this
that's the kind of frequency so i mean
so i mean it i mean to first order i see

so it's not very consistent
this mistake but the but the other thing i know
arithmetic ever church metric coverage
and so they said how much

and so perhaps they would changed the way weight too
and it almost argue for waiting that highest but the way they have
because everybody has their own opinion
you look at it's i mean it sounds just to think of did in the bed nine improve like more than twenty percent

rather than be absolute improvement
a bit but still there's something like factor too or something between matched media managed and
and so i think that if what you're if the goal of this is to come up with robust features it does mean
you might go pick some voice activity detector make that the baseline just like

whereas you sort of with some reasonable error recovery could imagine in the better cases these systems working
damage i think people hadn't really thought through about the to be idiots
and hopefully these teachers without because
but in reality it's you know there's all this overlap and so forth

the agency selfish but you've got the latency shorter now
maybe there's something that system can use
but they're more excuses that
so you essentially take the values that you get from the triangular filter and extend them so of the space

when you do the same improvements to proposal one
that on thee if things are somewhat
the now that these other things are in there is it the case may be that the editions of proposal to over postal ones are less than important
so what sorts of features are you looking at we've had some

so he actually getting back in town surely isn't already is
so you said in town you mean oregon
and these experimental so are using some kind of compensation so spectra subtraction

then when you have your final thing beautiful for one and when you have a final thing would go back
don't know if you go from the matched case to the medium it's not any enormous difference in that training testing situation and
no that's an expectation but it's something that hopefully you something that takes the taste

so you run we treat to two sites so i i have to look to see
equal i mean you
i think that you could make the opposite argument that the matched cases of fantasy

i thought it was like three two five i'll
it was over a week ago that did it so i can't
ago that did it so i can't remember exactly but

so after i did that then wanted to do was try increase in the number of mixers just to see
of mixers just to see see how that affects performance so
in fact you could do something like keep exactly the same procedure and then as if this thing on to it

there's because they start off with an initial model which is just the school
model and then they split it to the individuals and
each it's like if you say what's the best way to do an average arithmetic ever church

in from montreal i was just was scenic involved there
it seems like they should do like the percentage improvement or something rather than be
actually it wasn't wasn't so bad

right now it's a waiting on
and the fact is that for rhino for english they have weights that they combine
on what kind of rose with what passing

some people are doing that would be better weights some
but to combine error rates before computing improvement
with what passing you with i mean

combined or rates and
rhino so nobody would be they're probably right
level someway they might use the whole recognize to do it but rather separate thing but

and some people think that by they have different
by they have different opinions about this
than it that's just a question of what is your baseline right

some people think that it's more important to look at too it's ten percent and critique improvement wet much gaze down to a fifty percent on them mismatched other people
other people things that it's more important too grew up the me so much and
cases and it would have reasonable reasons soft segregation is you got to worse and worse conditions

actually it's true i forgot in this but
mean are you going to have examples with windows open half
going seventy sixty fifty forty miles an hour on what kind of rose

i mean the reference one for instance is back to hold on to an italian was like six percent there for the matched in
gather that these meetings it's really tricky to make anything actually make any policy change because
except it's english that's right so what's your calling expectations or recall is your subtracting the female male no filter spectrum from the fifty spectrum right

so you could argue in fact that the master something you shouldn't be looking at all
that the goal is to come up with features that will still give you reasonable performance
and again gentle bigger get it degradation

but which would be a much better business and
you have to for the world table
and so if we like remove the a bank from the fifty we have something that's close to the expectation thing

they're sort but they seemed like two separate issues right i mean
i mean to first order what you'd what you're doing ignore all the details
ignore all the details in all the ways which is did you complete lives

and so so it's better than the system that we had before
maybe goes the sixty four fours and the good d.
largest just using your on the work and

so there's days there
days there could be also the something like the mexican almost to correlation function though is
is this this a train system or is it the

or is it the somewhere you just pick some threshold
right now we just threshold how does it work
hopefully i think what we wanted to ivy's to put these teachers in kind of

because you're just getting some characterization when this driven by your
but we have to have a fifty because it's computing and consistent and we have
in overalls resonance have some residences went through these

spec drama looked so there must be something else that you get in return for that
so how is maybe i'm going into much detail but
into much detail but how exactly do you make the difference between d. f. fifty t. d. smoothed spectra on below

so some noise look like friendly they just know i'm boys
it's not really what's happening the vocal tracks you're not really right
tracks you're not really getting vocal expectation that's right

it's not very significant someone yes south we
someone yes south we

i did some experiment just a few more experiments before i had go away for the what was that week
i'm i didn't you know that's part of what takes so long to train it the back end for this

but in a here what's the difference between eight in inner loop in an hour considerations so what happens
you have to make that in your dot c. s. h. r. c. it detects whether you're running on a linux or a sparking points to the right executed bulls

as opposed to i think it's only took something like three or four hours to do the full training
as opposed to as opposed to

but i can send email around about it and so we've
i don't know and what happened do that but

got it now h. t. case compiled for both the lennox and for the sparks
and you may not have had that in new york ducey sh r. c. before if you were always just running this park so

i can tell you exactly what you need to do to get all that to work
but it'll it really increases what we can run on so

do that but the points that they were supposed to discuss is still things like the weights
this is a conference call for over a participant i

so the points where the with the weights to to the front or rates but our pain from different language and conditions
it's not scared that they would keep the same kind of freaking right now it's a waiting

a point
and right now like check every single so that happens with the current wages that very none significant improvement on the web much k.'s resulting you which differences and find now number

what did not look at improvements but just look at your your scores you know figure out how to
before lots of people don't voice activity detectors

i was in there but i think they started
i think people just said it wasn't or you know

but there just these stayed this program if waste when you combine
so but it's not like they don't really have a good idea about what the final application is going to be

but no to do is i would try to things depending on the exact environment that i was going to be using the system and if i
no i mean as evaporating here and there they

not actually clean what it is just that the training
of the cases it's that'll teach enroll their window up

that's an art now that's an argument for running or the opposite i
running or the opposite i the opposite argument

you wouldn't like as soon as you step outside a lot
a lot of the cases it's that'll teach enroll their window up

matched in eighteen for the medium ashton sixty
ashton sixty for the or how they mismatch

you should see a gentle degradation
rhino nobody would be there but right

s. you see but with voice acute detector
because we're still testing so

so you really need to put more into something
you know you use attracting in part i mean a lot to me

on there and if it gets in on they give us i gets i see
and then when that the proposals actually came and half of them had p. h. d.'s and have them didn't nafta did that

they're sort of separate unfortunately right i mean
and if it turns out that you can't improve on that wall i mean it you know nobody wins they just use in f. c. right

i seems like whatever they choose they shouldn't you know purposely brain damage a part of the system to make a worse baseline or you know
think people just said it wasn't that they purposely brain damage i think people hadn't

which might be much better
so i asked somebody for more information about that

and what happened here is that to be so we have this kind of
of some things and just try him out and saying if you have them

we choose a new who filter that's not short term
and which also got the frequency of sixty fours which trusted

we are currently testing weight lifting when you're on your towards indicated t.
it seems to improve on the web much gays

we the short filtering we belong feature
and a boy say that could be giving you a lot of variants

but it's a good think anyway too is for thirty days then we
around with this another way of looking is what characterization of the difference between the raw data and this smooth version is something that you're missing that could help

days then we tried to to do something like propose it to but having
so there's just kids departure we choose just a standup teachers

however we just have one reason which
that's right then the actor and then you just the computer differences and have to that one is something

it will be wasted thing we might have to look at that's what i've been in what sorts of
so what sorts of features are you looking at we've had some

so the spectrum of the citation for purely period except it's english you what's your calling expectations
is another always and b. c. no but he's

and we used to canon become that things between the phones we young to meet these
at the flea one anyone sentences i find it tastes good and

so it's not easy i mean that's
it seems quite robust and i said we take

something good and that the variance is sort of artificial because of how you're getting your truth
but another way of looking at might be that i mean

so the question is what characterization and you're playing
and you're playing around with this another way

when this driven by your intuition about forcing voice certainly there's just some characterization
intuition about forcing voice certainly there's just some characterization

there's just some characterization something back in the in the almost raw data rather than the smooth version
and your intuition is driving you towards particular kinds of statistical characterization of what's missing from the specter on bought

i mean you have variants only so it's kind
so it's kind of like you're just multiplying together these probably some individual teachers within each mixture so it's

so we have one pint for i see
bank which is you know gee that's censor them in the triangle so you end up with of victor i this and to the theater then

the variance computed
one two fifteen hundred it's up to fifteen times

but it's just no it's make sense to look at frequencies so this is
just at frequencies right so it's only so this is this is comparing an original version of the signal to a smooth diversion of the same signal

know i'm boys it'll cost for
is another always and they did that b. c.

they but it's a decent that they put in
cruise around zero but

to sell speech recognition last week

trespassing yes

and that's you know this end of the world you mean oregon

and for the last three rounds you they do seven iterations of reactor nation in each of those three and

the first one is three than seven and

seven and what these numbers refer to is the number of times that be h. m. react the nation is run it's

i wanted to first test to see if we actually need to do this many iterations early on

think and i got almost the exact same results

and but it runs much faster so

really fast but it's running linux

but it's running linux so

so you can now run your experiments on that machine and you can run

as you know five different

so i forgot now

i forgot now what the name of that machine is but i can

so at had the middle where the arrows are showing that you're adding one more mixture per state

will try to go backwards this at this point it's two mixtures per state so that's just

so it goes to

and i think what happens here is

might be between a shared share experiences or something or i think that's what it is

share experiences or something i think that's what it is

which is just the school model and

individuals and so it may be that's what's happening here i have

here i have to look it up and see i

to look it up and see i don't exactly remember

there were circumference coldest tuesday

do you know who was since we weren't in on it do you know who was in from montreal i was

that they combine our rates but for

it depends what you want to show

it's a weighted average

and so when you're average jerk directed improvement tends to give that of importance to the when much case goes

a waiter whatever and then give you a score

here's a score and then they can do the same thing for the baseline system here's it

so they said how much is significantly better with you and so

waste when you combine there are eighteen tends to be more importance to the difficult cages

i mean i was thinking about it in terms if i were building the final product and i was going to test

you assume everything's equal i mean you

i mean i think one thing to do is to just not rely on a single number to maybe

a single number to maybe have two or three numbers you know and right

you know and say here's how much to you improve the that the relatively clean case and right

case and here's how much you

that the training and testing

i what you would do in practice as you try to get as many examples of a similar sort of that you could and

so the argument for that being that the more important thing is that you're going to try and do that but you want to see how badly it deviate from that when the it's a little different so

that's that's an art i mean that's more of an information kind of thing

that's that's an art now i mean that's more of an information kind of thing

the opposite argument is you're never really going to have a good sample of all these different things

so i think the thing is that if you look at the matched case versus the you know the medium in the foot mismatch case we're seeing really big differences in performance right

i mean these cases if you go from that of the i mean

i mean i remember the numbers i don't know if you go

and it's a really big performance job

even though the testing condition is not the same as the training

me as much as everything with thus far microphone but trained

but trained like little noisy condition like those speed

and or stop the car and tested

the car and tested i speak conditions like

like when i leave

see microphone but right so it's still the same microphone in both cases

see microphone but in both cases

highest but the way they have it now it's i it's

which would mean down then mean that fifty percent on these new byzantine it's like more than sixty percent improvement in

rhino so nobody would be they're probably right

they didn't decide it's i you just this

you need more features

let's say friends m. i. c. francis doesn't have anything in it related to the pitch

example so suppose you that what you really want to do is put a good pitches sector on there and if it gets

i gets nine biggest yourself then you definitely in a in a voice and they beach and the speech i see so there's this

so there's this assumption that the voice activities hector can only use p. m. a c. c.

but this for the baseline

so if you use other features than it that's just a question

which is part of it i think sometimes gets too is that you can choose your features in such a ways to improve the v. a. d.

and you also can choose your features in situations prove recognition that may but

recognition that may not be the same thing but at they to both

recognition that may not be the same thing but at they to both

we had the other cici's before lots of people

that the baseline just like you pick some person at least became k. made that the baseline

and then let's try make everything better

and if one of the ways you make it better is by having your teachers better features of the eight days and that's so be it but

and they look pretty bad and

and in fact what they're doing wasn't so bad at all but

it should include sort of the current state of the art that you want to try and improve and

to try and improve and i'm at cici's you know kill guilty or something it seems like reasonable baseline for the teachers and anybody doing

and anybody doing this task it's going to have some sort of voice activity action at some level someway they

but don't have it on some level so

seems like whatever they choose

nafta did that were around

were around have to didn't it poorly so

we she what happened with this

so what i've since last week is

i'm from what judges ideas experiment some things you beyond baseline

and the thing on nine on my education just after they so

and the one that they use it which i use one from the proposed that or upper proposals

which trusted our first proposal we should we have

but it's edited but worse on the mismatch and id me smashed

and we'd occurrence way think i think it's such it's would be better

because doing much skating better

how much worse is it on the other conditions it's

when they hate she's that it's when they ate compare propose it to prevent one so

i mean did you see stymied is better

because it has the sixty four it's good

keen don't sound things and

know i just but the latency

and so it's better than the

we do short surgery support so what is

case and someone worse if the case

then junior out too when you're on that works

one reason which is the italian you snatch so

there was started some effort on something related to voicing or something that

so we try to find good teachers that could be useful voicing detection

we would be looking at it and very emphasis this pick from you temptation something

send mean the variance of the spectrum of expectation

@reject@ some you still down that's

but it's that's definite definitely left

but it's the definite definitely left

web forums voice portion we have something that as a means own open three

and for force portion demeans point fifty nine

but the variance seem quite i how do

we you who's in it state

and we used to canon become that things between the phones and we young to meet these

we take we draw is probably true so chris time for the consent ends and then they the same value sometimes varicose

right now we just trying to find some features and

west too took things that you can mother owns teachers largest just

you because it seems like what you said about the meaning of the voice and the and voiced that seemed pretty encouraging right

mean like i don't know that i would trust that so much because you're doing these kind

because you're doing these kind of an uncle mapping from timid labeling is right

really that's sort of a cartoon picture about what's and a boy say

so i mean looking at different statistical measures of that difference coming

by using the fifty you just you just information about if it's barstow so not always it's mainly i mean so

by having set of voice that's true what arguing is that

because what you're really getting is not actually voice her son force both for the

perfect so i'm saying is maybe that's not a killer because

if something about the expectation

and what is it about the expectation

so i would almost take

and you know one of them but and see you which is them helps

so is the idea that you're going to take whatever features you develop and just have them on to the future victor or

what's the use of the voice and voice detector

no u. s. i to use them s. as he chose features i see

it could be in your on the toward it does voice and in like addiction

but it could be and most of the big you're on the towards it does funding for education

it seems like a good idea

and you know that it's gotten hurt you a little bit to not have a respect real smooth spec drama looked so

and picked up on

so you essentially take the values that we obtained they smoked so of the space

them in the triangle so you end up with of victor this and to the theater then

then the computer difference computer differences and some the differences have to that one is something if you want to eat some see like that

and i think the variance computed tony from like two hundred artist who one two fifteen hundred it's up to fifteen

some voice sound kind and also like know no easy talk on high frequency

any rate something like this is what you're feeding your recognize are typically like

so like division thing you do that the spectre the ratio

you do that the spectre the ratio

that's so what's it what's the intuition behind this kind of a thing i

so kind of a thing i don't really know the signal processing enough to understand what is that doing

what i've been said what we honest if what you would like to read is sums like from a expectation single i that makes sense

and we have the man your bags

it's something that's like a train of thought oppose trained for voice on and

a train of thought

for voice on and that's that should be set for i see so do you have a picture

that's that should be set for i see

so do you have a picture that should is this for

it's a voice segment this picture what does it

it's that should is this for a voice segment this

it'll cost for voice

i just about to be doing dad for which it does we are coincidence what they should put that

the you know what you're doing in future extraction for speech recognition is you have in your had a simplified production of speech in which you do

yes i mean you i mean for but the in which you have any periodic great periodic source striving some filters do they have to put a nation that as soon as you

yes i mean you have any periodic great periodic source striving some they have to put a nation that as soon as you

i mean for but the correlation filters first order for speech recognition you say i don't care about the source in customs

energy and she just want to find out what the filters are the filters

they should be more close so they they there's a difference what the filters are the filters roughly act like a in overalls resonance have some residences and so forth that processing expectation so if i know went through these

they there's a difference processing expectation so if

there's just this world is you look at the specter on the love just the very

and then is if you have the full spectrum at all the little nitty gritty details that has the affect of both and

and so this is saying if you really do have that similar vocal track i'm hoping and you should check that off which gives us the expectation i call that

i call that lies because you don't really have that you just

have that you just have some kind of signal processing trickery to get something that's kind of smooth it's not really

that's why i was going to the i was referring to it in a more conservative way of saying
