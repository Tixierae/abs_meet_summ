did you now is to sort of come up with a highly as a sort of abstract pass
was so you still have the the thing about having dinner where you know what the actual intention was but
the task then for that person is spending all type to get there
of the recognize or in the dictionary then we can actually so the speech recognize are also works
you can speak into its and ask for t. v. and movie information and then when
actually so the actual beta might be german name
then i wanted to do dukes
the screen it's a i mean to what the generator like the english
but the to tell you that this is what's going how to berkes and they're girl in the presentation so we don't have to worry about
girl in the presentation asian local like that
and then you pick a movie and a certain churches times and you pick a time
because we're a problem for the german system to incorporate all these english movie us
unless we got some topic rose german movies that have just come out and that they're in their database
this is very rough but this is sort of what managed to come up with
go and there's going to be a lot of on the golden glove about that a can be and so forth
one question or when you
ski my rights are the source by going for chemo fit into the actions like is it one of the tags have
there's orientation could it could also be blocked out then that's
a very specific romances view thing and heard thing this thing that we start think that think of interviewing approaches
so where the gateway the argentina
f. m. like porch motion and caused action like that for s.
so like in are you able to enforce that you know if it's. p. g. action then you have that scheme out if
we have no you have that scheme out if it's a forced washington you have get a scheme present and
and then we started thinking about going through all bakery questions so when
they would bought scheme us would under so i under actually came there's a list that can include both
they would bought scheme us would appear so but snack
that commercial event or something sighing food there's a commercial events scheme and summer i
like i mean could have plot structure and just are two independent things
but there's also the sort of like causal also
and scheme wouldn't commit i think that's nicer
and scheme wouldn't commit i think that's nicer for a lot of reasons but might be a pain
i mean they're truly times when you have two independent goals that they might express it once but in this case
it sort of depends on if you actually write down the you then
maybe even not gee do you mean within the
maybe even not gee do you mean within the source that school actions this three
one of those things are going to be lit up when he passes on it's only
in that nevertheless
in that case we can't if maybe i'm not understanding where this comes from and where this goes
in that case we can't maybe i'm not understanding where this comes
so and this is useful you doing
they could guarantee that
this is a scheme that defines eczema out messages setup passed from one much work for another
main you mean from the natural language understanding or if the deep natural to and the sanctity action planner
now d. the reason for not using this approach is because you always will have to go back each
back each much of what you have to go back to the cop which you know and if you can have which parents and

when i'm they ask start tea and his gang when
his gang when they have the language model of the recognize or in the dictionary then we can actually put it all together so the speech recognize are also works
and then the person is presented with what's running on t. v.
or something like that this is not an exit of this sort of towards
this sort of towards and scheme
actions that can be categorized with her that
it gives us a kind of so what
did this but this sort of gets the job done in that respect and maybe deceiving
and more on d. business but your basic bolin and see my down there
like a we have ducking to it
we had this is the output sort of these natural language understanding right
so in the future it's so it's just additional information
like is it one of the tags there have go back to that
a supple beating and
beating and with we know
so we'll put on a that's a source but
and then the same about goals so i the question
with the scheme and in what actual action is shows in is will be in that and the action came a section so one
so one question this is
question this is in this case it's all clears her obvious but
but you can think of the interviewing approaches each having their roles right the i
right the i mean is implicit that the person that's moving is doing entering viewing in approaching but
but you know the usual thing is we a binding between so
the sort of like action specific girls and the more general source spot school this is the real story
yes is the real story worrying about that or not for now
a very specific romances view this thing that we start
thing and heard thing think that think of interviewing approaches frames and they have
don't know that's has question i was just doing it this
for me and this referencing thing great that's exactly what
it is if they're buying sits next action interesting
the bikes next chemo sighing i'm
next chemo that commercial event or something sighing food i'm there's a commercial events scheme and summer i
no of like causal also one is really facilitate any other and it's part of a compound action of some kind of structure
rifles and so i mean you have to focus on and decide to live
going four section of course motion
data structure you know like you say all right i'm going to do and s. p. g. action and

majors harvard has many
majors harvard has many mayor
but that so it was really callous i was confused nah me and not jerry
this other person can maybe make a mental note that i wanted to go shopping here and
it's a schematic so he'll be given this map which means that they would have to like isis assistance and for like kind of information would where things are
it's a schematic tourist maps so would be are
yes in a sense it's expected that the idea which
but that's look i not
it's the last week of april until the fourth of may
of may it's twenty six who for that there be here that they'll be here
that much from the posture and generate recite and this
perhaps advancers has something to do with the questions that just like anything
and then those actions can be in multiple categories at the same time if necessary so
so the first at school scheme in this case i've
scheme in this case i've ever i understand how we discarded we set this up
so or the in and full so the fillers of the roles source
let's see so it doesn't seem as exist because in case
with we know a lot about sources so we'll put on a that's
buying sits next scheme what interesting
and i it's kind of weather going is a bakery and then
because they have a related first ethical scheme in our course domain
this is more this is probably the way that's the way the two more to it just to draw no i also for i didn't mean to
so you always send up here i'm this person and i can have these parents and every message

and anyone who doesn't know nancy
not really the street network it doesn't have like street on it that would allow them to figure out their way
right and people talking about pictures and victoria representations and
i mean i'm not saying it's necessary but
project and make one more general remark has sort of two sites actions it's action items that were dude do you think with one is
with one is my to find this marking posture and the other one is so much if i'd find the smart come natural language generation marginal
respect and maybe deceiving concept really somewhat adequate in that sense that we're talking about two different things were talking
right those one the things but if it has if it's supposed to be categorized in category x. men the course scheme max will be among the structures that follows it's like
those one the things you're the follows it's like
also for awhile for
no but now you guys have seen the light soon
no because no we have not whereabouts either died seen the light soon
because doing it this way is in case there's extra structured it's any enter action that's not captured by these game is right either died do they go back and forth and i agree right which is why i would think
because doing it this way either died do they go back and forth and
right which is why i would think you would say enter and just say all the
and just say all the things irrelevant specifically enter and
enter and then the things that are abstract will be in the africans as and that's why the findings
right but as and that's why the findings become useful
that when you need this medically

do some sightseeing i'm a member of
and he also approached me and he offered to help all project and
questions and saddam together and write
but in that sense it doesn't make in that case it doesn't really make sense to read about like that right
such as the that goal
and all the names could should be taken comb kind of about it so
one question or when you point at the screen is it your shadow that i'm supposed to look at it's
are they working for and other things it's all
so it's this back it's there and it's going to
not i want to go to a bakery maybe their friends that they were going and meet them in
that like and i'm i'm inventing context or maybe i'm like the i mean like
but it's still the case that you could override that default by giving extra permission which
extra permission which is to me a reason why you would keep the inference of that separate from the knowledge of they really want to know if there's a big around here
be in it like first of all what modules are talking to each other using this right and

for example and they're mostly in english
like the english language sentence of it is these are the follow you know the falling films are being shown like that
so pass go and there's going
so i push maybe and both you know push in this and this force
exactly motion action friends
and right now the way the interfaces action go and then they have the what the person claimed the source of the person clinton's is the goal passed on and
actually the future of the content of the hypothesis would not only be right that doesn't hurt the currently
bad because i mean there's multiple multiples i mean that particular
but maybe means read nothing to i mean that particular cases mall there's a force side of that verb as
but maybe means read nothing to say about the that's what's that verb as
questions so when i say is there a bakery here you know
here you know i do i'd somebody once our macho too it was too personal tell the rest of the system paid this person actually wants to go there and be
and decide to live in a off of touching that you amateur kind of zero in on that
list all the parent categories that you know i list all the parent category a just like

no i don't we just don't continue anymore
because it's getting more complicated so if you know anyone interested
there's nothing that says you know these are the things you want to do so they'll
i'm not i understand this but i'm not i understand so it's this is what you made say like
are you familiar with that with a very about but i imagine i'll catch on it's based on like the materials
what so it's extremely important that the two of you also presents this town through that time
and i was completely flabbergasted either and i and
right so the rest of the building do these this is just the layout of the possible things that could go play that role i got
right so the rest of the building with the scheme and things that could go play that role i got
year so this means we can start using it basic you know

and the person is not allowed to take of this high level category this with them but just
that's better than running into problems
in english so it's not really a problem unless
the fact that with cutting the sections chemo right now should not intended to be going to continue caught into sections can know
on the end of the first generation stupid least also so gold actions
you know this person's so you have constraints that are dependent on the actual a filler semester entry
he because this is it's a good the discussion we need
there is no more quantify or something so no this is useful you

new set up using this new i
new set up new i
so it's you can see this is on one level and we are going to add to another straps if you want i. e. all rich action description on that level
as far as source that's what's to when you identify
and and so i mean i still i'm not entirely
it's not it's and so i'm i mean i still i'm not entirely that i really fully grasped the syntax of this you know one
and they do we want this scheme that's just dum bum
i mean it's if we can actually you know get it so that we can i don't want hot trends activate more than one scheme i've remember already pretty good right

know sue the interaction primal giving hints about how specific or how whatever the kind of question that there can to ask during actual session
and so diversity sending us is already producing the english it's news to get by in version one part one
right and they kind of are different correct
in germany on that day that evening
and so you take one look at it and say that's really nothing there's nothing for me there what's
actually the future of the content of the hypothesis would not only be an object and action in the main object but in action the main object into rich action description right that doesn't hurt the currently
there and be that person actually wants to buy something to eat there
so i mean so please particular action that you may want to characterize you would have some the middle sloughs that define you know in some way what distractions what about you can be i've

so if there's something that you're sending out you can also and mia copying of oscar
so would be it was still required that information and
but to favor already have something to print and i can work with that
and they're just sort of what would you like to buy and
not i want to go to a bakery maybe their friends that they were going and meet them in a bakery around the area
i have a question about the slope of the s. p. g. action so damned
think i'd i'm not if i understand the question only one of those do

and so we had a meeting on friday talking about how to avoid that
and it proved finally food fall in the sense that we came up with the news scenario for hollow to get the subject two reading have intention
they're the idea is now that makes actually we need to hire one more person to do that drop because it's
and they're just saying like what part of town the things censoring
which hope initiative script together
i should have we should have added and not annex another example with some excellent of this
but i think it's we are done think i system can handle that no not at all but to what are we doing

but first question for the subject is so they some things you know we thought the tourist can do is
perhaps advancers has something to do with the questions for example that just like anything and they're mostly in english
this and i'm us some of the better happened there and then
there and then you get your shown what movies too which films and it's going
and it's going to be of course all the hard to burke movies and what from are actually shoring and
what's is also and i for me in my mind it's
other thing i just i was that you could want to go to the big free because you're supposed to meet your friend are some you know to

so clerical so
so american beauty is american beauty
at and do we have means of telling it within that
so it's sort of because being in at first i mean is going up to it and or actually going from one place to another to take a picture in this
and the things that go into a category are it's suppose to have a corresponding scheme a definition for that time so
time so i what's the function of having it up there too i mean
he and then those are the ones actually you then actually define and say how the rules bind to your specific roles which will probably

so i the question is when you actually still ones out it'll be under action scheme those are
is going to be one of you'll take one of those four or
and other things it's all of those have they see these either specific france is a real sore more general franks with the roles that might have finding so
finding so the question is are how do we represent when things are linked in a certain way so
but this is a texaco detailer so pointer way to
really references from the roles texaco detailer so pointer way to really say pointers
really references from the roles in the scheme the bottom seems to the actual game is so i'm assuming really say pointers

and sort of to act upon those
i'm like i need to be within twenty four hours a day for the seven days that they're here not
so this is sort of what it looks like now
who uses this this data structure you
which is may or may so it's just like a pain to have to send it
for next i mean just because i knew when i

and we want to maybe ask them if you have get into isolated streets
got to get rid of these sort of s. p. g. slash something these i wouldn't need to have that right
these stop actions category because right
because what does it tell us
and i that you know this is something we need to discuss that and fact what you could say it's for enter you could
and you could have also indicated that by saying enter what the kinds of action i am right

and the things censoring
in and full then right source
these action team is have extra
a source but it's independent whether reusing dseg scheme in an interview our approach motorized this is just
all the i think what we're supposed to thing here is the category of the actions and or even approached too because they have a

it using the database the german t. v. movie
we have cost action
because in case we need extra information
what x. chemo or this action scheme there'll
thing to buy interesting would you say that the like i mean

do we have those means or even part of the m. c. i opie
but in this case it's really like there's a purpose means that you know for achieving some other purpose
if i'm the recipient of such a message and i it's
they're two different things one of which is you
it's not actually very actually it doesn't actually i'm it could it occurs to me that i mean it you know one right worthy intended

and motives you know the rest i this is some indications that he wants clemson girl's home from some but the relevance
and as a matter of fact when i travelled with my friends we make these expected these kinds of appointments we exactly
but i have a question all it's that's one of the bakery you know in the victorian of stations for you changes and when the before
no you define i ionizer action going four section
what are some types of action scheme as one of the types of actions

here and already she has already gone to the trouble of anchoring it's with specific i the into cheese and so she will find in heidelberg
april twenty six to the may fourth something like
so forth in the trench actors would be it coming in there as and then the
right types of that and her viewing approach those

such as if there's a cop a category and emptying your year old a film the person can then decide i want to do that at this place sort of
who those who know him he's the founder of i see i
is about seven seventy years old i didn't know he was the founder
i didn't know he was the founder

the whatever rivers streets
rivers streets and they know
and they know that they've decided that yes that's what they want to do this kind of action that they have it with them and they can actually read and person if
are you worried about being able to identify

and i do have some good news for the natural language generation forever
and the good news is i it's done
i mean that two month becker who does the german one actually took out some time and already did it in english for us
they're there should never be a hard coded fucked up from the bakery question the double scheme thing how

what today is
i don't know if you want to have in the same level as the action scheme that speech you can it's it somewhere in there
it's it somewhere in there that you need to represent that there's some kind of center and
like a source that goal or force whatever right

but is it using the database the
they both be listed here and
it is if they're buying sits next scheme what action interesting
and featuring you guys

i wanted to do dukes one has
but those could include roles like the thing that you're viewing of thing that you're entering the thing that you're betraying
too it seems like each of them has its own internal structure and mapping to these scheme is
get a you have a set of specific additions to the list to be feel rifles and

branch
i think we got to hit a lot of interesting problems and me in it
and as i preface that this is the result of one week of argue about it
being hungry in a specific intention to cross the traffic lights to get a you have

i'm i maybe just reading misinterpreting it into my head and the way that i've always do things
that may or may not be what you guys intended but if it is
but if it is in the top block is sort of like
of like you know you have to list exactly what x. chemo or

i think we've met before like
a couple times that's right be petty nineteen we've met before like i'm never talking to you about aspect or something like that some someone or other so
a couple times be to you about aspect

i mean is or counselor and just virtual guidance and
no i don't we just don't continue anymore roberts i
we've been arguing about it all week

we're sticking with it i'm dessert
so this about being recorded also
the in terms of why is played out like this versus some other the pets

majors and i'm just sending that have the right up that we did on too gross you hear this but but so it was
experiment the tourist information website this is where they're a website and then you get like figure out what the kind of
and then we can sort of this answer can say then you may want to find out what to get over here because this

copying of oscar took either of us could post it too
so the idea is to try to get that's just amazing that they might he was and tried to in to see if it is possible or with the choice of fools i the one experiments that i've in he was pictures so to actually and i did the tests but you know the it right i mean i'm not saying it's necessary but you may be able to combine you know taste and something but you know and also i think it would be a good idea to show them the text it kind of choose the task and then picked it this way and that that's the way so that the most guided by what you want but can come into his own yes in a sense it's expected that the idea which is never possible and that and this and that situation we had to exactly that on our list of possible way things so we were i've made a sort of city thing how that could work are you control you i hear you want to know how to get someplace and this is the plays and it's a museum in you want to do something and there's a person looking at pictures so you know this is exactly getting some place for the intensifying of and looking at pictures however not only worse to comment senses work more all the participants in friday's meeting worse it's got to be very laborious to make these drawings for each different things all the different sections if at all possible and also people would get caught up in the pictures saddam suddenly get descriptions of pictures in there and people talking about pictures and victoria representations and i would still be willing to try it they would have no more linguistic matter in front of the monday enter this room then i suggest we move onto the two we have do you project and make one more general remark has sort of two sites actions it's action items that were dude do you think with one is my to find this marking posture and the other one is so much if i'd find the smart come natural language generation marginal and this is not too complicated but i'm just mentioning it put it in the favorite because this is something we were talk about now i have some news from the generation do you have news from the parts or but that's look i how wonderful did you run into problems or did you run into not having time so that's good that's better than running into problems and i do have some good news for the natural language generation forever and the good news is i it's done i mean that two month becker who does the german one actually took out some time and already did it in english for us and so diversity sending us is already producing the english it's news to get by in version one part one i've it even though the generator is a little bit more complex and it would have been a changing one hundred birds but maybe four hundred words there would have been but this is i good news and the the time and especially bus grow and the time is snow pretty much takes it's the last week of april until the fourth of may it's twenty six who for that there be here not yes i pretty would be better if i talk about it on friday time fired so i think it that was similar to what you did for them watching that they'll be here
or whatever number of things and pasa partly because you need you know somewhere that those things fall into some categories and a maybe

it's i don't remember getting anything
take in a batch of arts
you know it and it opted some attrition for me just do that i

and person if they have been able for the object because it's too hard
because it's too hard to memorize all these strange german names
and then we going to have another we're going to have another try run i. e.

talk to a machine it breaks down and then the you were comes on
inside and enter there would be roles they can be killed so and
he was that type and you can rent

we were sort of get a protocol concerned so it's like enter versus view
we were sort of get a protocol of the primary into action right versus view
but they're shown like on the screen it's a

the tourist can do is anything that interests you
the person can say shot this is something i would do
this is something i would do i would go shopping

so to actually and i did the tests
i was just doing it this way we're talking
because i knew when i don't really just i just don't know what to make of this and what

right saddam suddenly get descriptions of pictures in there and
the idea is so imagine we have and i agree off scheme
a link between the action team that appealed in these and they came up or the image came is that would link is which actions came we were supposed to use it we could

actually name they'll like american t.
that bothers me that they're the same thing
because they're two different things one

they'll like american t. v.
too is there an easy way in dissertation to show when there's identity between things and i
no it's technically possible that you can fit scheme not written scheme

right i keep looking where your hand is
being put into the action planning
and again for john please just focus on the shadow

what that says is that there's an interface between what we are doing any action planner
i mean but there's what i think of you hit the button and
that's all recorded

think also that we can have one down as many as you want things from this came up to these action description of it
but the notion i got from nancy's idea was that we may find sort of concepts sewing rollins and the action description of the actions enter frame up there that i when you talk about the real but actually i tend to close with the goal and i'll be it was something called scheme at and do
something called scheme at and do

it's not actually very actually it doesn't actually i'm it could it occurs to me that i mean it you know one right worthy intended
me that i mean it worthy intended interpretation of this
i mean but buddy's goes the

that put write a letter in these categories that in which it had it would had even as a there could be a communication event action
even as a exactly he was that there could be a communication event action or something like that and you can rent
he was that type and you can rent

but on what link daisies for filled out to the action because in my
because if we know that answer is that as an s. p. g. action right
we know what to look for in s. p. g. scheme and put up a powerful and they paroles later on and you could have also

and hopefully it is by it by means of keys to that we would be able to get a better form formal and a better semantic idea of what a construction is
and my we can make it work for us

because it also intense german
so you had like an action ski

and by the by popular vote
why don't we get started on that subject anyways

so whereabouts of collected and
collected and be this the funding things have happened since we last met when will

and more than three
what happens is that eighty there was some confusion between you and jerry with it they getting to you're talking to gotten snow

made majors major majors in the department
i'm just tell you what i think of you hit the button

and we have a little description of asking people subjects tool contact save for it recruiting them pauler thing and
and and that i hope doing

and since we have one already did
did jerry talking about maybe using our class

the students in the undergrad class he's teaching
he said we definitely yes however there's

much to reach out to try to get them all but i it's that
i would just like to ask like if that could happen for next i mean

to try to get them all but i it's that people in class cover a different set so then
i the is the department that you were talking about

he that's what i suggested to have that people like and you can't too because we have you know people from other areas
just or even i could you know i in their classes as

not only cox so also we were talking about linguistics
also we were talking about linguistics and of course comforts

a sort of analogous to what fate say has started in combining biting here and already
action and then you know somebody need either the computer or the users as i i know i want to do a source that goal actions so what're my choices among that and

them but just that the person is able
that the person is able to take notes on the map that we would give him in the map would be that tourists systematic representation with the symbol for the objects this other person

and then goes in and toss it tasks with the system
that's the way so that the most guided by what you want but can

and we're going to try out that any
questions to he you'll have the say somewhere what their intention was so you still have the

and the censoring
the that is more i mean for them to have the buildings send their names and maybe some

run i. e. the first with that new setup tomorrow it too
and we have a really interesting subject which is wrong k.

you could come in as a subject and if
over here because this is where the shopping the circus

the tourist information website so this is where they're supposed to like figure out what the kind of
no not at all but the approach inventor

and there's a store there so
either and i and that's also it's going to produce the concept of speech donovan i'd summation for necessary for one put one in english basin and just you know

so the idea is to try to get that's just amazing that they might he was and tried to in to see if it is possible or with the choice of fools yes
i don't know that this is a cat and this is a category structure here right action scheme

i the idea which is never possible and that and this and that situation
i the one experiments that i've in he was pictures

and there's a person looking at pictures so
it a change every s. p. g.

and also i think it would be a good idea to show them the text it kind of choose the task and
of choose the task and then picked it this way and that that's the way so that

i have some news from the generation do you have news from the parts
of which is you could think of one as a sub you know prove wannabe condition for the second

yes i pretty would be better if i talk about it on friday
and most of them are going to be hollywood movies so american

so that's good time fired
so that's good time fired

and it would have been a changing one hundred birds but maybe four hundred words there would have been
then onto the modeling

bus grow and
time is snow pretty much takes it's the

that it doesn't really have much meaning to grad students but final projects
guarantee it's just i be here i'll

i'll be here working anyway so this is
i'll be here working on something so this is

no it's just you know they're coming for us so that we can bar them and ask more
so no sample generator output yet

so you don't know how determined dying a dog determined that they would i like actually works it
works the first thing is what's you know showing on t. v.

this is they the scheme the x. m. l. here not
l. here not an example or something like that this is not an exit of

and then we have forced motion we have
the other into those is right but having a separate

we have a library of ski mess
they're going to be you know finish college in their real arcade detail so pass

and we'll have you know force motion and cost action actions
dry currently this is what the action plan or uses is

to you have the action and the domain object check and i'm what did
check and i'm what did you think you

laser pointer would be most appropriate there
and this is on on my list of things that's the next week be that would be

set of between here and here so
the are some you know to so you like being able to infer the second thing is very useful in probably often right but having

instead of just making an attribute in which is just one thing we decided to make its own entities that we could exploded out later on in case there is some structure that we need to exploit
because it just x. moment additional but

a block whereas sources just an afternoon is that
no so it's just it's bad out here first

here first meeting source would be i would have a name it i it maybe i'd i mentioned that i t. maybe
the kinds of action i am right

this action scheme there'll be a certain one that has his own structure and maybe
and maybe it has about that specific to entering or viewing or approaching

and you can also describe them in a general way outsource medical him and maybe
outsource medical him and maybe there's other image came knows that you could you know add after this that you know how do they work in terms of you know a forced dynamics are they working for

and all and of our very easy would you similar you know i happen
you similar you know i happen to know how what sooner or later means they practice

that commercial event or something food scheme and summer i it
that commercial event or something food scheme and summer i it

but might be a pain so
i mean they're truly times when you have two independent goals that they might express it once but in this case

with some excellent example that would
example and this is on that would be

so damned interview approach they did and up but so it's in these particular action as the
right you like so you're saying you can practically turned the structure inside out or something or

in a way similar up to i the interview approaching they want to send a little bit a little dictate let's see a dog that
the i think they and sometimes we think got the task bendix done he because aggressive

so it's sort of somebody derived football much of it that is being pencil this
redundancy right in which the things that go into a particular you have categories of the top under active scheme and the things that

inside and enter there would viewing approach those are all sorts of school and
so if you wanted to have a new type action you could anytime category

so if i had one to go from outside inside then you have the all the need needle we have is worth that goal set of roles
so you start to be outside in pass at the door whatever right

it up there too i mean i i'm wondering whether you could just have outer
you could just have outer actions gimme they're just sort of say whatever you know going to be interviewer approach or whatever number of things and

the parent categories i list all the parent category a just like
category a just like frame higher key right like you have

like you have fundraiser so you say enter
like that so if someone could make an example of what would actually be in it like first

around here re enter it could you're not a coincidence
i'm i'm just hitting everything with a hammer that i developed i mean

that and so i can do an interview approach it's not
only one of it's more like just i want to i want to do and enter and

and it's going to get more and more complex the complex or not drawer the main scat
i think we would have lot of our points in writing so

a couple times that's right be petty nineteen to you about aspect or something like that some someone or other so

you are my g. s. i. briefly until i drop the class yes is that's right

no summoned some introductions are in are

apartment that so the old gang show annoyed advice cry have been with us from day one and

and they're engaged in various activities some of which you will hear about today

and also interested in problems concerning reference of the more complex type

and he sits in as a interest just participant and pepper

that's pretty that a good characterization

that's pretty good i think

keys is not technically one of us yet

but it's too late for now so it's about

i've got the headset on her

especially i you will be joining us in the summer

additionally his interested them surpasses english because it also intense

german extra capability of speaking and writing and understanding and reading that which

do you know nancy i know nancy

i made that they've already nancy sadly the i don't know myself what

the i don't know myself joking you didn't

before you came in win

didn't know i didn't mean to be humor copying but

and say is with us as a love six days ago officially

but in reality already much longer and

much longer and next to some more or less thorough crack with the data collection she's also the wizards and the data collection of

for us i think day

and he it was he completely that some something confusing happened and this

and this idea ways to get sort of speed this of mayors of the department

the students it's exactly how you interpreted it list of majors

it list of majors in the department

made majors major majors

that me and not jerry

using thing that you read up

thing and there was some confusion to the consent form which is that you just signed

however there's always more people in and the fact that department and are just taking his class or anybody else success at the moment to much to reach out

he that's what i suggested to have that people like jerry and george and et cetera just and you can't too because we have you know people from other areas in

or even i could you know i could do the actual their classes as because i mean

could do the actual that's so it's done because i mean i know how to contact our student so if

that's so it's done i know how to contact our student

is it is a general solicitation that you know just contact you then we can proposed posted to the newsgroups

as a matter of fact if you if i couldn't you can send it to me

have very i suggested if you look at your e. mail carefully you may think you may find that you already have it roberts i already really

it's i don't remember getting anything

and then secondly we had you may remember the problem with the re phrasing that subject

that subject always rephrase sort of the task that we gave them

so if you know anyone interested and what i'm about to describe how that person to try to mean to me terry suing passed

i'm a member of a sort of analogous

the these high level categories this subject can take a couple

place sort of make up their own i tell your area and pass

here and i want to maybe take a picture of that's and maybe

of that's and maybe each year

hopefully said they'll have a little bit more natural attraction

not really the street network it that would allow them to figure out their way

and maybe some made a major streets and their names

all project and he was more thinking board some high level thinking tasks and

and we did help you could come in as a

so that's what's going to happen tomorrow

i'm not i understand this but so it's this is what you made

i'm not i understand everything that's been talked about but say like so

are you familiar with that with a very rough set of the based on the website i'm not i understand everything that's been talked about but i imagine i'll catch on say like so it's based on like the materials you had about heidelberg

are you familiar with that with a very rough set of the day that based on the website about but i imagine i'll catch on it's based on like the materials you had about heidelberg there's

set of the day that based on the website there's

day that experiment there's a website and then you get

the tourist information website so this is where they're supposed to like figure out what the kind of

the question is just sort of how do we get the tasks and i had that they have an intention of doing something and have an need to ask the system for something without giving them sort of perky awarding of phrasing of the task because

because what happened then dennis that people reprieve repeats as much as the kind of that freezing

the goals that we've that you guys have been talking about our this these to i i'm which is three modes their question concerned so

that's where the instructor the person we are going to hire and the subject sit down together with these high level things and

would you like to buy and then there you want to buy whatever cookbooks talks and there's

right that's or what's left

and we know that the intention is to enter because we know that the person wants to buy coke so

hopefully that's what i mean to like those tasks are all going to be on in the u. s. about which of the three modes right so

it we had to exactly that on our list of possible way things so

we were i've made a sort of city thing how that could work are you control you i hear you

hear you want to know how to get someplace

and this is the plays

and it's a museum in you want to do something and there's

so you know this is exactly getting some place for the intensifying of and looking at pictures

however not only worse to comment senses work more all the participants in friday's meeting worse it's got to be very laborious to make these drawings for each different things

all the different sections if at all possible

and also people would get caught up in the pictures saddam suddenly

i would still be willing to try it

but you may be able to combine you know taste and something but you know

they would have no more linguistic matter in front of the monday enter this room

then i suggest we move onto the two

we have do you project and make one

and this is not too complicated but

complicated but i'm just mentioning it put it in the favorite

because this is something we were talk about now

do you have news from the parts or

did you run into problems or did you run into not having time

so i think it that was similar to what you did for them watching

i've it even though the generator is a little bit more complex and it would have been

but this is i good news and the

and the the time

and especially bus grow and

it isn't finals coming up and pretty much after that fine it's just

but final projects mine

them and ask more questions and

saddam together and write sensible code and they

and they can get some talks and but

for the seven days that they're here not unless you're really want to they're very dependent

unless you're really want to they're very dependent

not unless you really want to

and this more questions and that's

it just to me that you know you sending me the soon and i was things and

so that was like one of the first thing in the first task was getting at working for him so that's

the basic requirement is full sales morse when

if something actually happens in some answers come out then we're done

so it's not done and they're kind of correct and

so it's not done and they're kind of correct

me there what's running in this and i'm us some

the cutest thing so he'll just displayed

but the to tell you that this is so we don't have to worry about

like that of a car

and it pick seats and all of this so

but it's this at this time we are at an advantage because we're a

person may selects through that and then you know whatever chicken

what's the next thing

the idea here is that

sections can know what that means we have here first of all

with her that are related to start school so that's

also these things may or may not get their own structure in the future

so this is something that you know made us to be it as a result if you work in the future we

in the future we may find out that they're really decide these subtle differences between

even within the domain of ensuring in the light of us up school pensacola scheme they we need to put in to an additional structure up there

kind of so what this week and you know it's sort of the call any of any way we want

it was sort of gave us some had how

gave us some had how do we avoid writing down that we have some of the answers up at gold did this but

different things were talking more on these sort of attention that level out there and more

that i'm supposed to look at it's

and the problem is that the current system does not thing was between goes of type going into goes to type on a go to a place like big picture of et cetera

looks like now since it'll go action from it from an up tick name p. just fairy off the type church tune-up ticket part of tower of the type teller

and is that and that's changeable

check and i'm what did you think you

right i'd like to be a distracting have no

right i'd like to be a distracting enough that i just thought he was have no

enough that i just thought he was doing

which were abbreviated english rad is

so you had like an action ski right a sore spot school ski my rights are the

like is it one of the tags there have go back to that

in this case it wold be but the teachers i i'm it's hard

i i'm it's hard for me to exactly he's so busy that will

he's so busy that will start the object that is

it go so or the in and full so the fillers of the roles source

additional but the fact that action scheme and then sort of watch extra that's the whole

that's a block extra that's the whole and to that's

here first meeting source

maybe kind of orientation could it could also be blocked

motorized this is just proper keys of the s. p. g. scheme

we can talk about past being the fastest the quickest the nicest and so forth

since you bring it up now we worry part of it that's

frames and they have frame specific parameters and roles

are they working for and other things it's all

in a certain way so we you know for enter that there's container potentially involved and

involved and it's not

some kind of center and the interior of it corresponds to some part of the source that's you know go goal i in this case

and i don't know that something we need to invent or you know just

would wasn't there's supposed to be a link in me i invent or you know just

but that's one thing is that we can link up

meaning we can reference for me great that's

this referencing thing however is of temporary nature because

nature because sooner or later the w. three c. would be finished with their dicks path specification and then

specification and then it's going to be even much nicer than we have

nicer than we have really means of pointing at and be you the sensation of one of our elements here and link it to

and link it to another one and this not only within a document but also documents

but as soon so it's

it's there and it's going to be part of the and see other i p. a. p. i. by the end of this year so this

i mean personally i'm looking even more forward to the day when we going to have x. forms which is a form of notation lady that was you just say it u. c. s. p. g. action up there he's enter then the goalie type can never be a statue

a filler

you know this person's not make sense in light of the central never t. how ever semester entry

how ever it is you know some of these sort of things are imaginable

so like i did have some their scheme eyes for f. m. like porch motion the gateway the argentina

we have no present and

have no means of enforcing that

so it's would be considered about it if we have an s. p. g. action and true no it's p. g. scheme but a force action scheme

could happen which is not bad because

in my mind it's crucial really necessary is that we can have much of a scheme us in my action scheme us in parallel and

and these are two different scheme outside either

outside either and so called scheme of getting the and then the buying stacks scheme would

scheme what is the the bikes

so so we what can stay in shape the s. p. g. c. with this up at school about that

and to buy bands you know at bush however in that respect the place thing to buy interesting would you

is a bakery and then i get a commotion action which takes place in a bakery

and they're be identifies identified to be the same thing

so so there's like level little guy the other day so there's

day so there's a single event of which they are both apart and

apart and then they're independently they're events which have very different characters as far as source that's what's to when you identify

to when you identify source school and whatever there's going to be a desire or whatever eating hunger whatever

eating hunger whatever other friends you have involved they have to match up and in ways too it

is also a question of the workers this and i hire hierarchy and they do we

what would it have to be careful but with thing because

because i mean many actions i suppose some of the almost in so many other options if you go to bed early

if you go to bed early you have a general intention off not being hungry maybe

the other into those is or bakery around here not right but having a separate

particular action as the actual this guy and we have a choice over

over the justice

it a change right every s. p. g. action either isn't enter or if you are from right

so it is i'm so old judy was open could be between one and sixteen

however be it seems to be sensible to me you to view the mass mutually exclusive

but he i understand i not do you mean within the source that school actions this three

but no and how racy and so that's

is here's an s. p. g. action and it has to

and it has to different i aspects

because you got to a beagle fuel ito approach it touch it

going and did you g. and that has to do with right it so it's i mean but even within four section of course motion

mean but even within this context but it different auction

and it's all action too would have that is variable possibilities of intel between what you would like to do

these actions i don't know if i'm an answer a question out of this but

a question out of this but the categories inside of action humans s. p.

action humans s. p. g. action as a category all

i don't know that this is a cat and this is

one of the types of actions came as a source that school action

and what are some types of that and

then this category but we put it or it may not

put it or it may not necessarily we put

necessarily we put i knew action name in the categories that and which it has be

wet reactions that are related scheme is like a source

and then later you know the we have a communication of action where we define it down there is

so there's a bit of redundancy right in

categories and a maybe multiple carry jersey you say which is the like a fool messy

got to get rid of these sort of s. you mean but i don't know if i wouldn't need to have that

know this is something we need to discuss that and fact what you could say it's for enter you could

that list all enter you could say here list all the kinds of scheme is that on the category that you know

fundraiser so you say enter you say my parents frames are such a such he and then those

sounds like a paper i've read roles which will probably be richer and fuller and have other in there

sounds like a paper i've read around here re enter and have other in there it could

i mean but there's a good question here like i mean

how do i come at this question

one of to do and enter and then you're more interested in knowing what the parent categories are that

i think i'd i'm not right so that the the sort of representation you were just talking about seems more relevant i kind of think you have to do

it's only turn will be it's hard

it's hard i watched was had the enters the case even approach not be there

it's that came into my mind that sometimes even too could be on a would be interesting

in that case we can't if but i think it's nevertheless maybe i'm not understanding where this comes from and where this goes to what are we doing

the approach inventor

we will not and this discussion anytime soon

that's kind of a contentious point between the two but

was just like so refers organization

yes again so i can listen to you are the reason why one is better than the other i mean that come from other sources

yes because no but no the marches don't this is sources

you always get the whole body of your models and to figure out what the dogs to watch all

all you always it along with it

and every message

may or may not be a just a pain it's it

i'm completely wedding to throw all this away and i understand

wedding to throw all i understand

this away and creepy to redo it you know it and

i a promise for the next time to have session and annex and i like samples pulse for run through and see how this then dates to each other using this right and
