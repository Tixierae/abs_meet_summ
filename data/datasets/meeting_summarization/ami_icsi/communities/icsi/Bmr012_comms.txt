this ten will be to
channel b. is probably liz generally
you're kind of county so can eight definitely
you're kind of county so can eight definitely
county so can you talk of it said definitely
right you go first then
but for broadcast news when we right so
they're just bigger to transfer that's right downtown
recess is built be is not regressive filtering and modeling and so it can be sensitive to the kind of filtering but you can
you can no kept from would expect so much
no actually i would think that you would do get better you get better high frequencies in local welcome the way around i think
but who knows maybe we could
u. you that sounds interesting as dot e.
because there's no point in doing that it's not going to be any bad so why
do before a long time to get from
and emailed the terrorist
if people are not it's just hand rendell upheld

because i there's some and on can talk or so
but the only twice that's right downtown them before but
but the only twice them before but
i mean that was if it's the same then lincoln down simple here but all those
we're going to plenty of low frequency on the museums with the fans
it's just it's eight channels coming to that
eight channels coming to that has to do with sampling i have no idea
it i didn't realize but we also have to get a tutor the receiver or the other and that's
or the other and that's four thirty
for each city the tutors and then also
city the tutors for thirty for each
the sturgis one
so it's so my question

so if you don't know what to put just leave it blank
looking at the first signs of look much better than that and then somebody
are a fair number of terrorists that are you
no those actually a lot of there is i think are cares and there were lots of course the is in on pause
no those actually a lot pause
right so this would be like if you take the words i'm just for overlaps is for not offer words
way form i mean segments them but not down so and we could try that's
or but push a button or something when they want to make i know about boy you should probably erase those last few or
they said we got the good ones and we just need one more so
be any bad so why do we get one of these with the ground with a different headset
and i don't know identifying somehow i emailed the terrorist somehow

the problem way i think age is all right and
this thing time to think numbers have more significant digits and they should right there's things that was incorrect where they weren't monitor on like that's what happened there was i mean
it's pretty
be but if the word recognition is this good alignment should be pretty good
because the transcription it's just that where maybe we need to work out a
it's just that where we need to work out a system for doing that purple so that we can send people to transcripts and
we re sample and our resale pool
missing all the dollars some not all i just i found
this unit here is three fifty three hundred fifty dollars
they said we got the good ones more so
isn't and that he recommended i ground c. m. three eleven e. set for two hundred bucks a piece

recognize or which is a gender dependence but like no adaptation no crossword models no try and the by gram recognize
took the first meaning that jane had transcribed and
and then we ran up to i the first twenty minutes up to think time
up to think time of one two zero that
that's twenty minutes or so
about it then i the joystick check for it the acoustic one shouldn't do anything i don't i agree
i have it do anything i don't know exactly what affected about i'll talk to i agree
those are the only but most the models which i so that's i was just going to say
but you know jane they caught all too here that's
certainly the recognition i suppose try need
from the outside world or but

and in separate used individual channels we segmented in into the segments that jane had used and
and down simple that so eight k.
it was interesting how and then i don't i mean the bicycle
they the old brought right really frustrating was like eighty remember what it is ticket transcribe
it was interesting how they the old brought i don't remember what it is i mean the bicycle ticket transcribe
it was interesting how they the old brought i don't remember what it is i mean the bicycle ticket transcribe
actually i think i so no so that was just the person be that might be they might be myself i'm not

actually in order to assess the forced alignment we need some linguists or some people to look at and say or these boundaries in about the right place
they're pretty good so and then it
do i it is south so i can i data itself until people have a chance to exactly
so i can protect my directory they're exactly
i see music some cat to do it no i'm using
so and that's actually said in your meeting that's how
and then nine channels is the maximum we can do so

christmas no generally i don't tend to be
christmas no i you're kind of thank you no eight i don't tend to be no chain
i you're kind of thank you eight no chain
something i don't know who i mean how this is done but done this
but is there other any issues with them something because i know that done this
let's figure that we have eight which are set up and then there's want to have that

time even if you don't read the digits you have to fill out the dish form that we know that you were at the meeting
with under is this helps i put together a sort of no frills recognize or which is
it was twenty minutes and then minutes and i thought forgot about that
so i'm surprisingly there's the previous page has some more information about what was rotten once in the middle
there's no i mean the language model for switchboard is different so you can
sixteen it's more common for broadband that isn't this sort of thing that is

i sent out an email a couple hours ago so
a lot of there is i think are out of vocabulary physics like p.
and i have tried on the far field like
easy i'm and then there's things like for the transcription i got when someone has a digit in the transcript i don't know if they said you know one or eleven and i don't know
plus can
the other topic is getting more my and different mikes

anyways it's twenty minutes and i actually
be right so anyway it's just that's sounds like a bug
be right so anyway it's sounds like a bug
and that's interesting because i think
so and i'm pretty from listening to eric that you've given the word she was saying and given has been n. c. asian that the reason that he's so much worse is the little pal
for this purpose and just use that may be sinking in that'd be great it's not a bad idea

but that that recording have the glitch in the middle also by that
there's in the middle i see
he sounded to me just from he's i like it with it so she
it with it so she purgo she
and dance archaic akron and pool r. s. m. p. i don't really
in your meeting that's how i know that's sexist and that's

d. there's nothing right
and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times
which i would so the real value mike's tried on the p. c. m. and
and if for some reason we see that it works it takes more just face too
but each fibers channel has eight channels and
and there are two fibers that go into the car

i see i see which kind of low and show fun
just strangest just different filters instead of just i can imagine
instead of just wondering whether the filters i can imagine it would be i
instead of just wondering whether the filters i can imagine it would be
i don't i mean if it's any better

and then somebody turned very bad and then
that's actually i think i so no so that was just the person that might be they might be myself i'm not
i mean it would be you know it would probably take about minus in it would
so i got a quote
we can fit we have room for one more wireless

different so you can see some like this trent lott which trent lott
so then and i have tried on the far field like
eleven and i don't know if they said pickler t. c. l. this
i should that's not the issue it's just the only
because i know that do you recognize it w.'s can't do that so it's on the fly

if it's you know is a hundred and twenty percent or maybe not
maybe if with meditation get this down to fifty percent or forty five percent or something and then if
and then if easy and it's seventy or something like that's actually something
that's actually something sort of work with a little bit
i think it's really and this way we at least have a baseline we know that presses

suggestion instead of age but they a your birth
because age will change your first changes instead the same usually
actually shouldn't be the other way around not for me first year although i'm
shouldn't be the other way around not for me course on the other

i it depends on how long the corpus is going to be collected for
there's a so that actually i see there was a glitch somewhere
so that actually this it twenty i
it was twenty minutes this it twenty minutes and i thought i forgot about that

age is all right and then there will be attached to this a or to these forums so that you'll be able to extract the day off that
that's what i would assume but you never know you know it wouldn't hurt to try get easily try
because it's one bored with two digital channels
so it takes two five percent of the one board

that's a good idea
means good news anyway but if the foursome limits
so that'll be something that actually
probably overlaps it's not that good

so i haven't seen any mail or with this or so here's the actually a copy of the you know but what you said about the glitch hehe concerned about the that
interesting as a complement to are fun and meeting and dot e. d. u.
that just for this purpose and just use that'd and use that it's not a bad idea
if it was possible because it is it you know already

you see this area it's no around
what happens is it actually affects the script that don i mean if we know
don i mean if we know about it then i the joystick check for it the acoustic one shouldn't do anything i don't i agree
it's just that's why we only have twenty minutes but there's a significant

they caught all too that's
we know that presses the transcripts are very good so
are very good so once you can get the words that the recognize or which is it's total subset of the things you need to understand the tax
here plus can

but if the foursome limits are good we can get all kinds of information for
so and then it converting automatically from the x. amount chopping up the way forms and so forth that's not
and so forth that's not the case that the end of one audience is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with and switchboard
the board even if we can't have a feeling that be somewhere let's figure that we have eight i mean for the few times that you might want to have that the spring or mike

@reject@ on your upper lip long
@reject@ on your upper lip long
@reject@ on your upper lip long

so for people wearing the wireless mics like this one i find the easiest way to where it is for this or like that and if chuck china long one two three
so for people wearing the wireless mics like this one i find the easiest way to where it is for and if chuck china long one two three
for people wearing the wireless mics like this and if china long one

you would do higher it's actually a lot more comfortable that if you try to put it over your temples so
it's actually a lot more comfortable that if you try to put it over your temples
more comfortable that if you try to put it over your temples

about that to a thumb and
that's interesting from your mouth so about like i'm wearing it now
so what did you get the same results as i doubt it liked to jane you could actually not the worst

why didn't you get the same results of the internet to i could see i just like that's
why didn't you get the same results of the internet to i could see i just like that's think
i see i see and i'm not which kind of low and show fun i just like that's think

i see i see channel which kind of low and show fun now
channel five speak again now
should be good enough force alignments

we're recording maybe two that's all right so the game is a real good i tend to be one two three four fights
we don't care how all they really a farm date recommended must want to send him a card
care how all they really must want to send him a card

we're recording that's all right so the game is a real good three four fights
actually no and just that they can somewhere and all rerun it it's really not a problem
reason i ask is these sort of handmade wiring jobs fall apart connector

but everyone does need to do it
and so that's that name sexy e. mail et cetera
we had a lot of discussion about the variety of english and so on so

it's like i designed the foreman i don't know what to put for my own region
may have make my suggestion instead of
we don't but there's no other date on a farm of the at the recording date recommended

knowing that we don't care how all they but there's no other date on a farm yes but what we care about is the age of the at the recording date recommended
wonder if this is a
we talked about that's i recognize it he

and so then you also the digits form which needs to be filled out every time that's pure form only wants the digits form every time even if you don't
this thing time to think numbers have more significant digits and they should where they weren't monitor on like happened there was i mean
our sound receptive s. and s n.

some and on can talk to jane about this there's
to jane about this there's some bugging the actual think time filed that and we're not
and we're not where it came from but after that was a little messier

so i haven't seen any mail or with this or so here's the actually a copy of the you know but what you said about the glitch hehe concerned about the that because it's it's
so i haven't seen any mail or with this or so here's the actually a but what
or with this or here's the actually a copy of the you but what you said about the glitch

there's the it's right once in the middle
so i'm surprisingly adam is the golden voice you see this area so that's actually it but that shouldn't affect anything
so i'm surprisingly adam is the golden voice you see this area so that's actually it but that shouldn't affect anything

minutes but there's a significant amount of nine zero they're
amount of the other one i saw was that it they're like more because there's a lot of there they tacked on just because of the way the script or i mean
some of them up almost not all of them i found it

the other one i saw was that it because there's a lot of there they tacked on
the script or i mean they were at the point
that was fine but that was the one i saw was non a

i mean these it's sort of funny ones is it'll get those
sort of funny ones is a lot of perfect one thing good ones and all the references i get those
the references i mean you can read them and we get more results you can look through and see but

physics like p. c. m. is three words of p.
good because otherwise the word recognition would be really crummy it
thing that plugs in you actually have to go into the side rain so because the reason

one thing i i had to do it some of it by hand but i think a lot of it can be automated
i didn't get so have language follow straight from by gram from switchboard acoustic
acoustic models for also from switchboard or so they that's amazing

so it's right that makes us
i would bet we get new mexico that would be worth it
on that too because she certainly in that when as a burp users he was pretty strong he she

so it's now if we can just sort of eliminate phillip how when we get new mexico that
so that's you know something like seven hundred eighty bucks for one more of these i'm and
i'm and then also it turns out that the connector that this thing uses his proprietary of sony

she she did good sheep right side good
right so so i the good news is that
somehow i was just thinking somehow it's not a bad idea

the sri system we'll have more data and we can also start to maybe adapt language models once we have enough meetings
so then and i have tried on the
that's what i would but it wouldn't hurt to try get easily try there's your answer

i mean clearly there was just the actual meeting transcription thrown into the language no tailoring at all
a cat the for candler gorgeous dictionary
a cat the for candler especially gorgeous dictionary

maybe actually marked work boundaries
maybe a linguist who can say you know roughly if these are and how far away they are
now i mean if we're never starting so

the other way around if there were word recognition was crummy neil lime it might be but
i mean there's still just do the percentages and i mean
knows maybe we want to find all the we could try we're going to plenty of low

probably overlaps in in fair number and switchboard as so
than another there are lots of ways to the down sampling different filters to put on
so daily and

certainly i'd like to see soon as we could i mean maybe
i mean maybe get some of the questions out of the way this is could
out of the way this is could how it does with say easy m.'s or maybe

adapted so what i mean is
be the data that you take in sri first question you're
first question you're maintaining end up in a place it wouldn't be publicly up like that kind of right

it's you know we had to get them to prove them and
to get them to prove them and then it could the other question is can ask is if we're having
this meeting that you have no problem because

that's true course but these results are based on data which haven't had be haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subject so i don't know how that stands
that isn't music innocent telephone and i if you're
that isn't music innocent telephone and i if you're comparing like if you want to run recognition on the pgm you would want you don't want to down temple that wasn't

actually no don't stop and all rerun it
i mean the corrected all and so
i mean i hand edited the whole meetings so that can be

it's a digital audio orientation the board found something to six thank
thank god it's not more than that
thank god it's not more than that

but if that could change if we could drop that i mean they would also have to get another eighty d. in another mixer and all that sort of
if we could drop that in another mixer and all that
dawson emailed and asked them

and the six on the table so right
that's a really dumb question
is there anyway we can have you know like a wireless microphone that you pass around to the people who you know the extra people for the times they want to talk

like question i mean i'm just not it's
like question i mean i'm just not it's
like like you know jerry springer you know i mean but there they conferences i'm just not how we would handle that and it's like the college

a pie highs and get it's close to your mouth as you can get it china's
a pie highs and get close to your mouth as you can get it china's

just trying to generate good data for recognizing i think we're supposed
yes we're just occurrences prices of having people for transcription it's you know we had

way out that was @reject@ corner wasn't using the proper wise and then also for all of them if you're broom is adjustable the boom should be towards the corner of your mouth and test
way out that was for all of them if you're broom is adjustable test

i doubt it why didn't you get the same liked to jane you could actually do even a little closer to i could not the worst
i doubt it liked to jane you could actually do even a little closer not the worst

this ten i see what you mean that's right we could up the game slightly if you wanted to it's
i see what you mean we could up the game slightly if you wanted it's

recording everyone should have at least two forms possibly three in front of you depending on who you are
it might be hard limitation i mean

we don't care how all they really a farm date recommended must
so i'm surprisingly adam is the golden voice so that's actually but that shouldn't affect anything

i shouldn't run the meeting
i actually had a question about the dog something for the most

i have i want to talk about new microphones in wireless
as we talk about before there's probably overlaps this is it's not that good

and i'm an address on talk about recognition results
for forced alignment

turned very bad and then we noticed that the reference is always one off with that's that might
no actually it was it was a so that was just the person mismatch not

so so that's what we i was pretty certain that it worked up until that time so that's good
so we have everything recognized but have but that will be completely gone if the same time so the glitch i'm the only glitch

so we have everything recognized but same time so the glitch i'm the only glitch
and it's about a fifteen minute drive right

know hehe concerned about the that because it's it's
know this is cliff occur there hehe concerned about the that because it's it's it's very small

this is cliff occur at other there because it's it's it's very small
not so much the vocabulary actually i think

this is cliff occur at other there that there's an acoustic glitch that occurs where the channels gets slightly a synchronized so that it's very small
so that probably is gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the s. h. p. jan ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second and

and so the channels get a little i think in essence if you listen
and is it only once that happens it's right

i have about i'll talk to you about it not though it
i do remember you about it not though it has no effect on my transcription i mean i had no trouble hearing

i you about it not though it has no effect on my transcription i mean i
i do remember i mean i had no trouble hearing it and having time bins but

this i do remember seeing once transcriber produce an incorrect x. m. l. file where one of the sink numbers was incorrect that's what there was a
i do remember seeing once transcriber having time bins but there was a

right there's things that are in smaller increments in a frame interesting
i mean this is really and think sunday

in i think time then they can't be right so sounds
example about you know pathetic information and speaker overlaps

that would really be a sometimes and that definitely in the correct indicates a buck
problem so anyway these are just the ones that are the pre bug for one meeting

so i we right sounds likes
there are a fair number of terrorists that are you know with got the so i so the selection can generate and who cares and there were lots of

d. there's nothing right
really good and i'm hoping this

there's all maybe we shouldn't say peezie have an easy
there's all kinds of other like just let and

so i mean the bottom line is even though it's not a huge amount of data it should be reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of reasonable you know switchboard this is
know switchboard this is like about how we do on switchboard to date with this switch were one trained mostly train recognizing

train recognizing switchboard too is got serve a different population of speakers and a different topic they're
and we were all getting like seventy percent error and switchboard

so are better ship one so there was on that's great
so are better ship there were say when we did have the ninety three workshop and we were all getting

especially for the very first run i mean
if the first run i ran the switchboard i got a hundred twenty percent were there

so i went all also this means is that
it is a bunch of things

a lot of and i rum so i guy it answer
so i guy it answer i said that there's not a huge amount of difference going from it's not like we

it's not like we probably lose a huge amount that we won't know because
amount that we won't know because we don't have any full then models first conversational speech probably not as bad as going

i should say that but for broadcast news when we played around between the two it was me right so yes i was so that's good right not a deal although combining them
because it's going to give us a timer you know we've done that

i should say that the language is not just switch but it's yes i was so that's good not a deal although combining them worked
i should say that the language is not although combining them worked

like trent lott must've been
switch where it was before

i mean our complete system starts by doing the agenda detection
the percentages and i mean that i

reality and then i was thinking so we might want to take
up and then there's a ninth which is pass around to a hand held

wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing
wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing now i mean if we're never

for producing a database that everybody's going to do on starting so don't worry about what that's the close talking
that everybody's going to do on don't worry about what that's the close talking mike's tried

which i would which one so the real value the databases these and no but
no not how a handset

which i would which one so the real value the databases these and
which i would which one so the real value the databases these and

need to ask one question
which is so this issue of the legalistically aspects of very pretty so you know spree adapted

we have no names
and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might it takes more just face too

for doing that purple so that we can send people
to transcripts and get back any belief that they want

is there any the other debt
other debt so is there more than one way to do the down something where one might be better than another there are lots

is that i thought that in order to so this is like
there's one level that's so this is like there's already down

for telephone that's what i was going to say i mean
that's a good idea infinite expansion

for telephone that's what i was going to say i mean
so it's it's just that they're operating from switchboard which was completely telephone database and so i see so

think that you would do get better you the way around i think
so the other thing is to see if we can get them to do a custom job and put it together i'm they would

there was just one more thing i want to say was just unrelated to the recognition except that
it's sort of related but

good news also
and that's too bad because they're very animated and

and but jerry also so we're starting on
you have fewer he

and so that's going to start monday and
to start monday and one of the things that i was realizing is it would be really great if anyone has any ideas on some kind of time sinks in this way that people in the meeting can make a comment to the person who's going to transcribe it

those last few or i want this not to be recorded now or
were they going to do something with a pad now or something like that

because i was thinking you know if we could do was across pets cross paths
because i was thinking you know if the person sets up the meeting isn't there and it's a group that we don't know and this do was across pets

and this came up talking to jerry also that you
also that you know is there any way for them to indicate to make that the request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow so i don't know if anyone

what i was just suggesting this is has ideas or you could even write down it's about three twenty five
what i was just suggesting this is we have these this crossed that just for this purpose and just use twenty five that'd and use that it's not a bad idea

so we i think if we want to do that more than that would have to have two ports
and then you have the same conversation if

be hard limitation i mean one thing is that the whole thing is that is all structured in terms of worry killer sampling so that pushes
because i want to for the daisy chains that's fifteen says sixteen and the six on the table getting more

requirements out but i was wondering if that could change i mean they would also have to get another eighty d.
and see if that works

so if we want to use a different set headset the solution that the guy suggested and lots of people have done if sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end and then
the end and then you can buy a headset that has take kale and solder yourself and that's

and that's the other solution and so the jacks are
so the jacks are forty bucks a piece and

you know but there might be a way to say that are going to be these different people emailed the terrorist
but or also for you know if people are not it's just hand rendell upheld

that's somehow i was just thinking somehow it's not a bad idea
if we can't get into the board even if we can't have a feeling that be somewhere i mean for the few times that you might the spring or mike

way out that and then also for all of them test

was @reject@ corner wasn't using the proper wise if you're broom is adjustable the boom should be towards the corner of your mouth and

the proper and about that to a thumb and a half distance away from your mouth so about like

you're kind of county so can eight definitely

right so we are recording

right so we are recording

we were doing a new speaker form and you only have to speak fill out the speaker form once but everyone

but the thing is ten years from now you look at the forum they're say course on the other hand you good you view as the age of the time of

but the thing is ten years from now you look at the forum knowing that you view as the age of the time of yes but what we care about is the age

i still don't see the problem either way

came and then also if you haven't filled one out already you do have to fill out a consent form

and that should just be one person who's name i don't know

so should we do agenda items

i what time have to leave

the by gram recognize or in

or in that strain on switchboard which is telephone conversations

and to don's help you done

it was interesting how it was twenty minutes and then i don't minutes and i thought forgot about that i mean the bicycle

no actually it was it was a so that was just the person mismatch not

it was a complicated dog because they were sometimes mismatch

because they were sometimes one often and sometimes random so i was

so we have everything recognized but gone if the same time so the glitch i'm the only glitch

so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first so i haven't seen any mail same time so the glitch i'm the only glitch

we scored only the first

so i haven't seen any mail or with this or so here's the actually a but what

or with this or here's the actually a copy of the you know but what you said about the glitch hehe concerned about the that

this is cliff occur at other there that there's an acoustic it's very small

and is it only i think in essence if you listen to it in the middle there's a little part where it starts doing click sounds

adam so that's actually but that shouldn't

you about it not though it has no effect on my transcription

this thing time to think was incorrect that's what happened

numbers have more significant digits and they should where they weren't monitor on like there was i mean

and so then i mean you look at that and it's got you know more than three significant digits in i think time then they can't be right so that's sounds

that was fine but that was the one i saw was non a non on upon it sometimes and that

that would really be a problem so definitely in the correct indicates a buck

and what which this so that's very encouraging

and what which this is really encouraging so that's very encouraging

which this is really encouraging because it's free recognition there's no encouraging

results you can look through and see but pretty good and as i said i would like to look at gladys is because it sounded

pretty good and as i said i would like to look at gladys

is because it sounded like even the ones that caught wrong it sort of got right sounds

there so i we can generate right sounds likes

there are a fair number of terrorists can generate

physics like p. c. m. is three

words of p. d. there's

there's no language miles pgm or right did

or no language did you say there's no like a trapeze e. m.

no language model i mean those e. m. you mean

you mean so every time so it's just easy you have it's in there maybe we shouldn't

we don't even know what that just let and i mean anyway there's that's right jim let

just let and i mean anyway that's right jim let

we don't even know what that there's but this is really encouraging because so i mean the

topic they're talking about things in the news that happened after switchboard one so there was on

i mean this is really and think sunday

and think sunday assuming this is especially for the

assuming this is especially for the very first run i mean if the first

it is a bunch of things in this snow to various people especially

it is a bunch of things in this snow to

various people especially i with jane that would help since we have this

since we have this new data now you know to go from the transcripts more easily too just the words that the recognize or would use for scoring i had to

so they didn't have anything from this and no and actually that's great that's amazing

so they didn't have anything from this that's great that's amazing

and actually we actually use switchboard telephone balance models which i that's amazing

those are the only but most the army i so that's that's the only acoustic was just going to say

are the only but most the army so that's that's the only acoustic train you know we have a lot of and i

speech right probably not as bad as going you can pull models on telephone penn speech right

i should yes i was so that's good right not a deal

actually more data from broadcast news but with a

news but with a with less weight like trent

by the just for finally also ran i mean our complete system before

so just for the heck of it i read that it said a hundred percent male

heck of it i read that it said a hundred percent male

and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it's got all the gender surrounded veg it did

surrounded veg it did

but you know jane in adam have you about equal performance and here

because i think the their language miles are quite different so and i'm pretty

i would bet on that too because she we get new mexico that would be worth it

and again this is without a lot of the sort of bells and whistles but weak can do with the sri system

i mean clearly there this is like twenty minutes of one meeting with no tailoring at all

not so much the vocabulary actually

things like that where you know the would probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things but

things but in general it was really good and

i'm hoping this is good news because that means

because that means the forced alignment should be good enough

to give us a timer you know we've done that for one meeting

so this would be like if you take the words you know enforce online among all the individual close like close second makes then how good are these sort of in reality and then not offer words right

i was thinking so we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription maybe actually

or you have someone look at the alignments maybe

but i think it's got to be pretty good because otherwise

really crummy it wouldn't necessarily be

really crummy it wouldn't necessarily be the other way around if there

now i mean if we're never starting so

but there's other phenomena it's a meeting

it's a different thing there's lots of to learn that close talking mike's but

and see if it's you know is a hundred

see there was one more thing i wanted to remember

it was congratulations

it was i mean i really didn't do this myself so wondrous

myself so wondrous set up this recognize or and by

or and by the way they recognize or all the files i'm moving to i and running everything there so

there so i brought back just these results files and people can look at

and people can look at them

we talked about them

but people who are not associated with this project

human subjects issues i told you about that exactly

i should that's not the issue it's just the only

do i it is south not the issue it's just the only data itself until people have a chance

do i it not the issue it's just the only data itself until

right now they're not there in the speech group directors which so i will i another know that actually

yes we're just occurrences i another know that actually

that you have no problem because i i mean i speak for myself but i think that

anyway so i wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that although we should clear

to that although we should clear with american down course but these

so i don't know how that stands i mean if you get

i mean if you get fantastic results and it's so salting data which later end up being lessened by you know certain illusions and i don't know but i want revenge

know but i want revenge

we i mean once we get all the streamlined maybe you hopefully

maybe you hopefully be fairly quick because

i actually had is going to be a rare thing that there's a place for the most actually the police are also dish

i actually had is going to be a rare thing that there's a place for the most police are also dish

we re to do it our sound receptive sample and no i'm using s. and s n. d. our resale pool

akron and i don't really

missing all the dollars some of them up almost not all of them i just i found it

some of them up almost not all of them i found it

of them up almost all the elves that's the of them it

so the other thing we should try it to just take the original way form i hard for and a few of the consonants

it to just take the original a few of the consonants

and see them to see them too where i recognize or we could try that and that's

and see them to see them too where i recognize or and sees just the it's it's something that the same thing we could try that and i suspect that's sort that's

that the same thing i suspect that's sort of premature optimization but

one you can try i only down to live first because i was i mean that's just one line that's one line of code

one right only down to live first because i was i mean that's just one line that's one line of code to comment

right and it doesn't is no more work for they're just bigger to transfer to comment

simple here but if it all those eighty meg file sick a lot to copy into my directory so

but now i mean it's not it wouldn't be a problem if you're interested in it would

minus the transfer time it would take a you know ten minutes to try and it's about a fifteen minute drive

in the front and can do that

you know it's at some point someone so we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speeches or to see if there's any differences so

you know it's at some point someone might have optimize whatever filtering it's done for the actual recognition if there's any differences

right it just seems to me that you know small changes to the language model and the vocabulary so swamped that may be premature to worry about that and so one is

and so one is half a percent better than the other i don't think that gives

i don't think that gives you an information

it's just as easy to give you the sixteen k. individual it

are you using individual it was just more just base you know for storing them so

americans custom are you using smirking storing them so

and modeling and so

we can try it if you generate like the same set of files just up to that point where we stopped anyway and just that it's

actually no and just that they can somewhere and all rerun it it's really not a problem

saw that's like because we actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters so

parameters so shouldn't you i mean now

i mean now i have to do is you the reference file let's stay the same it's just

let's stay the same it's just the individual segments of beep proximate twice as long and i could just replace

long and i could just replace them with the bigger ones instructor and so

so that can be run it's just

one question which is i have the impression from this meeting that i transcribed that but there was already automatic down sampling occurring is that i

this is there's one level that's already happening right here there's already down

this is being recorded forty a killer which is more than anybody needs so and that's actually said right here right and it gets down sampled the sixteen

which is more than anybody needs and it gets down sampled the sixteen

i know that's sexist and that's how i know it

it's a digital audio like are we found something to six how i know it

and i have no idea what filter using so if they could hurt is it a killer

for telephone and i have no idea what filter using so telephone if they could hurt is it a killer certainly accepted as like standard

database and so that was kind of the sixties the sixteen seems to be pretty typical for

that was kind of the sixties sixteen it's more common for the sixteen seems to be pretty typical for this sort of thing

talk for more to record meetings that he had too many people in his meetings and that's too

he won't have more than eight and of a meeting

and of a meeting on even deeper understanding e. d. u. you that sounds

they going to do something with a pad at one point something like that we could cross paths

so i don't know if anyone has ideas or

things i don't know if you know the surface a question for to mail to dan but

but is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for the setup or could we go to a third board i don't know i'll send mail down

i'll send mail down and ask i

and ask i think that it's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort because it's one bored

but that's a question because that would

it you know already we have a group of people just from the cannot all be my and

my and it's not just because we haven't been to the store what

the store what is the limit on each of those fiber challenges that this

sampling so that pushes requirements out but i was wondering if that could change i mean they would also have

believe it or not and sony only sells this headset

isn't this some sort of thing that plugs in you actually a piece

i understand that reason i ask is these sort of because the reason is the only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike or justin thee connector

and they probably want quantity i'm they would just charge us

and they probably want quantity too

so my question is should we go ahead and get that nine identical had noun it's ground mike

before having one come here and have some people try

and see if it's preferable and if it is will get more comfort if that works

because i mean i think the microphones arcade right

arcade the right it's just they're not comfortable

the it's just they're not comfortable to wear

could make our own headbands and and he said they

headbands and and he said they don't have any of these in stock but they have them in l. a. and so will

them in l. a. and so will take about a week to get here

where this for the long term so to just go order

where this for the long term so to just go order

it's a lot of money for a head band and who is the contact

it's a lot of money for a head band and who is the contact if i'd want to do and in voice because i

to do and in voice because i think that's how we did it before a long time

do before a long time to get from

right because i want to for the daisy without getting more

like like you know jerry springer i mean but they conferences i'm just not how we would handle that and it's like the college

that's a good idea infinite expansion

kind of rules last

not no not how rather than get it you want a handset

lives hates the locale is that handheld really any better
