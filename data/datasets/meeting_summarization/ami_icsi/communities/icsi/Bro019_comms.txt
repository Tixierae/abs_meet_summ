tell a little mouse clicks and press and so forth there were some of the
is mike nobodies you're might
year program for example if you only want your thing to run under linux you can give it the linux attribute and then
attribute and then it will find that fastest available linux machine and run it on that so
you can control where your jobs go as it extends all
self so you can give that as an actor but not only around that
right now andreas and i've been the main one using it in where
jobs get delayed so it's sort of a sharing thing
which can you to lose time right if
with regard to the or are he
might not they significantly
but i didn't read it lived there quite a bit to make it better then
everybody does that and they wanted
exactly i that is board the consensus is like you things
a book and i phoned that in smart of the speech that god is let the spanish one and it was by just fifty was in by just putting the and point
i you don't need any but the speed enhancement so
i like fifty with it so the baseline itself improves by fifty percent
so it's going to be harder to beat that actually but
even match lie about it but that's really worthless on our and then i
you can remove online edition or but it doesn't change anything
no i they're going ahead the same
masters
the to remind me of a matched be
we are playing we are some and trying to put whatever the construction and the code
you could be very simplistic recipe action and now energies
which i already tested but without the friend dropping cheney and
dropping cheney and i think it's important to a friend dropping if she is because actually is it respectful subtraction
if she is because actually it respectful subtraction typically done on and after the male scaling or is it done on
you can do both but i cannot
that is if you want to be construed the speech it be a good idea on a fifty beans
it but they present causes
the other thing is like when you're putting in that speech enhancement technique
is it like one stage speed and some it everybody
it doesn't behave even if is on pasta different and it
looks a video of the white because you know what was that it doesn't a definite fish spectra subtraction
the noise light and then if anybody can say the speech beg you to this thing again i don't have cable right
review surf you do this such sector sectors attraction that i'll forget it and then you then
and then you then and the little bit of noise addition i mean that's
maybe we but we find some people so that agree to maybe work with us and
it's promising and everybody works really hard on the same different aspects of the same thing another thing
but they saw that
we did note on that one i suffer more and it's the same just it
no i work we date that young and spun he's
i mean we've had discussions before and
before and one of the things that struck me was that about this line of thought that was particular interesting to me was that we whenever you condense things in irreversible way you throw away some information
and that's mostly views is a good thing the way we use it because we want
they're looking on it says figure out noise of her voice property whatever's that's
prefer make interesting thing was but it's they're just something in that difference which is useful sonata
so i mean that it's true there's lots of very ability but again we have these wonderful
about nothing i want to really talk about i can
to really talk about i can just share a little bit senior

around here so the people in the group now
so the plan for using these is we're running p. making customs here and
here and andreas sort of caught in that all sick stepping up to speed
around or maybe i should do i think you on the website about it or something
there's a command that you can use called run command run bash command
run bash command run hyphen command
commands you can say run dash command a l. s.
to run and and that's a simple way to get started using this
there's a lot of features to it and that kind
you know i sort of got started using the recognize i just recently and
i fired off training job and i fired off a
and i fired off a recognition job and
recognition job and i get to the email about midnight from my thing are you running too training simultaneously uses
so i had to back off a little bit but soon as
i've have a question about thee paralyze ish and so
so let's say like a thousand little jobs to do
how do i do it with run command
you could write a script which called run command on each subject right a thousand times
on each subject right a thousand times
but you probably want to be careful with that because
just because then it would keep other people it's too much file transfer
it would keep other people it's not it's too much file transfer and so
so if you had a script for example i had a thousand things that needed to run you'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were going to use run command to only have ten of those going at a time and
a time and then when one of those finishing fire off another one
all twenty five people were sending things all twenty five machine
things were a lot less something if you just use your machine exactly
you have to be a little bit careful
and he knew writing make files that you know your final job depends on these one thousand things and when you run the pavement
and when you run p. make on your make file you can give it the dash capital jay and number and that number represents
that's i can get some documentation
i mean the chips are running
time so you could fire off a thousand of those and
of those and it doesn't know any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running
in you just had a an h. t. k. training job that you know is going to take six hours to run
go screw this so i
use that's so people won't even have to worry about doing speech on speech
i mean the better match maybe the one you just used affected by adding the and find information
a car and so you drive around bunch and record conditions or something and then i
we are doing are funny everyday multi
funny everyday multi multi strain and so forth

and also a stefan to a really good resource for that if you can't especially
in the proposed what i did was i built that indian food is designed using being speech
maybe because the speed is already cleaned up other than hats men so into using
didn't i didn't david beckham at art i just
so are people supposed to assume that there is
should that this texas attractions how things work even better because
even with very minor
because when they would change their me tricky
so we begin that's sort of the other thing so maybe my pronunciation issue so try to inspire me from this kind of thing and
the sickness ups is roach has actually in between if they're doing it
they just take it
the other noise what was your point about color
it can be used for getting rid of the night and janet hey
to somebody is generating wall street journal with added of artificially added noise or something sort of
sort of like what they do t. i. digits
now we have these meeting data
and we had the digits that we do at the end of these things and that's
with that with connected digits
mean i no one has done it then test one they just distant like using historic manager or
and use it you know in combination or alone or whatever with what targets
which would show as what are we really getting out of the filters
probably not by itself or in combination
but not much on the idea it's so
on the idea it's so i think i decent feature produced discriminating speaking on was having
is anything because there wasn't any anything to discriminate between speech and to the
shark bites you down in was like they go to the huge improvement on it doesn't but in a christian
there was a but and i this i toward though exciting some high in order information from the skeptical efficient soon
soon for of it and some

and he's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to run things using he making customs you don't actually have
and it'll actually export that ls command to some machine in the institute and do an ls on your current directory soaks
soaks substitute ls for whatever command you want to run and
and so assuming we get all the new machines up then we'll have lots more compete to use now that
to use now that one of the things is that each machine it's part of d. p. making customs network has attributes associated with it after
is what it operating system and when
and when you use something like run command you canned specified those attributes four year program for example
as it extends all the way down to an individual machine each machine
machine each machine has actually which is the name of it self so you
if there's already a job running on some machine and you're trying to select your job will get queued up and then when
and then when that resource that machine becomes available your job lit exported there
you know you should probably not run more than say ten jobs yourself at any one time
that's going to take a cute i mean i can get some documentation
running if you launched any jobs they're own running
if you run command that i mentioned before is doesn't know about other things that you might be running
so you would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once and
other but if you use p. make then it knows about all the jobs that it has to run
syringe man and it can control how many run simultaneously
you it uses export underlying lee but
lee but if you
if you if it's meant to be run one job at the time so you
so why would one use that rather than teaming if
teaming if you have
like for example if you didn't want to write a you make script in you just had a
and somebody is using the machine you typically use
we did this and another difference i is that we just justified propose i want these domestic these without

since the twenty fourth we're on
and then at the end of the meetings will read the digits everybody goes around
sessions are our i'm nineteen digits everybody goes around the reads the digits on the bottom of the forms
one thing snows females here for the summer
with that because you don't want to saturate the network
no and wondered that when you had it the on line normalization and so forth that things got better again and so
no nothing think staying goodbye don't make the same time constant i'd be used
that's what the feeling is like they're going to already given on speech
so maybe just you could right miss about the related experience because you get some
speech right and so one difference is that i you were taking spector
and right now if we look at the results it's always better to it seems always better than fronts to come from to imagine i miss match
so but the vet unmatched miss too i mean the better
onto it's like this is not got evicted by asking out on something that much
i they're saying that if you were companies that was selling the commercially that you would have a bunch of people driving around and much cars and
to and then they're generating issue k. scripts to
have there's no i know they have converging on h. b. o. using some mississippi state i'm it's just that the state maybe
something as it's something is funny
because we want to suppress things that will very ability for particular fanatic in its
i just about any feature and that seems to
and that seems to be and really hard on the speech that kind of lot of but not much

thing snows here for the summer right here for the summer
but soon as we get the more machines than then we'll have more computer available so
that's just a quick update what we've got
this so that seems to be getting in doing older than system slightly
and that was i knew i phone that i have make some changes to the i'm constant that i used because
constant and we just knocked suitable for the enhanced speech in order to be tired on the proposing one
the different i'm once so i find that i mean i didn't get an accents
no again if you have enough
went just to see on some place but in addition commission to see whether you have some
many doesn't it doesn't behave
this week is being proposed by c. i mean is it
for minimize nation maybe did you center
but we're hoping i actually dave and i would just talking earlier today about maybe at some point not that distant future trying some of the techniques that we've talked about on some of the electric everybody data
he said that the idea it
did part of folk were discovering is ways to combine things are data driven then or not

so it was not didn't seem to be a good point to them and then if
that's just and what they submitted
does i just like in i just think the cats are coefficients coming from that system and then plug in india double that my dad if
just the i don't know baseline
to see that how much the baseline assess in but it was by
boarded the c. n. updated the supposedly once i find it getting any simple to do this and
were you were also combining something buffy i
so which provide us up speech simple are we removed
significant but the problem is that it's not significant but if you
speed and some it everybody seems to have a mutt through stages of speed and it's amazing all the proposes ages are you
but if you have to use and but to something and how does a mobilization to make it so they're making
i know i get i can productive but i'm from i it done accumulates

should i start from
how i think it's like from the post i don't know some missionary
so that the base lights of i mean
so you see say what they want to jump on for a second so
i mean amended unexpected behind sick
even if it's only psyche worse for wear matched
it's it's like means that it did it i mean he's not you know if it's because
or is it done on d. a fifty pins
day spectrum of fine see message they're bound
some smaller cabinet us
so don't be happy that i've kept superstitions
but again you could argue that's exactly their own network that

on the other hand they're not so close that they got rid of all the interference so it was
choice precisely because it's in the middle
men so into using this not a band and if it is i'd be some entered i thought you for this so that
showing any into the mine up or find by plugging in addity
it i mean i think it's a time constant already is the value update that's
our are people not supposed to use any speech outside of those in points
and this in a of different
so the the different that
the different that the i go into just combining two things is mainly going from the thing with some speed up really doesn't what video that if that's undoubtedly back
no training from this just

and then just i progress reports individually and then plans for or wherever go between now and then
could say a few words about some of the compute that's happening around here so
i'm not exactly how long it'll take for those to come and but
to come and but in addition we're running so the
after beats like how much memory the machine has what it speed
just try to limit it to some sometimes some number around ten jobs at a time
me and i just i like the idea it's like effect you matched because it's i perfect match
because it's i do she added but this is
and eve i. e. then he used internet what use didn't. defeat it they're just as i worse
i really wonder though i mean we've had discussions

features to it and that kind of helps to balance the load of the machines and
thing and it'll find another machine the fastest
i mean i didn't get an incremental or not using online on my station and
they're going to already given point information it i
when i met was you had something like capture a or something right and
and much cars and you have something that was roughly similar and
you've had any given it but we didn't expect distraction we are doing are
does i mean he was showing above some something on noisy speech some improvement on the not
some improvement on the not to speak
to speak some smaller cabinet

given the choice we there seem to be very strong opinions for
one and then the channel number usually one less than that
so one thing is to talk about a kick off meaning
and if you say that and then some job that you want to execute it will find the fastest currently available machine and export your job to that machine
says d. s. or i recognize or has all this p. make custom built into it so
it's not that so much as that you know with if everybody ran fifty jobs it once then it would just bring everything to a halt and you know people and so
and you know people jobs get delayed so
syringe man doesn't use key maker you it uses

and we ordered
sanity and then i phoned that
i missed something
too dark and online on edition didn't give me any of them
and mainly because if it when you're perfect same dropping in base i system you can improve a lot h. m. and and
i what's going to happen
the other thing would be to combine into doing i mean maybe one and
and kind of had and another

we're the succession are nineteen
not getting but if
i did get something different but they
seem and i want you to be worse
visual learner than you panic so you probably you're talking about your voicing
than you panic so you probably you're talking about your voicing

but i find that i would have changed the value that a big factor but i didn't
that's how they do like the to thirties the classification for twenty five percent of something
but are they changing the waiting
because them the made it made the reason for the main
silence on to go got these new features but
that should get more relevant now it's going to be given in points

because the u. n. improvement r. h. m. and i'm and also gore down significantly in the spreadsheet so but descents it'd be more evenly
being to come by and i mean the first thing that sickness up space went just
know that bikini shown if that but did by young to do finance what this but see it but to love to see not
i did the defense funded
because so bush we you use sink that use their body and she's hide maybe you crossing
just about just you class speech

which is that you know if you rent something it's a machine they come in and hit a key then it yes
so some of the machines at the end to have this attribute called no we've effect
there is no other things that we find anywhere shown to be poodles like
there's they caught today extra questions
that like dare i took an initial that i was too and one of our hours too

i don't hear this inspectors attraction
similar and maybe that's the argument but i'm not
some something being through and not as it is but plus stage and then do
so if it is an art austin do definite many doesn't
spectra suppression doesn't seems to be that thing to go for logic i that it does times that

but this is not the recording
the vet imagine like the many times
i mean unless they deliberately chose it to be different if they didn't because they wanted to be matched it is pretty much
it is pretty much you know so it's
it's not care eat

that's true for the additive no ways artificially added noise we've always smoke everybody too but for
but for and there's been noisy speech this five or for cavalier that we've worked with and broadcast news so
news so we redid broadcast news evaluation and some of the
some of the focus conditions are noisy and
you've had any given it but we didn't expect distraction

they're bound to kind of spend dick life he sent us domestic that have gone on a thing on upper to shown of the spectrum of the seeing that
who i. d. i still found kind of defeats to fall dish getting me need to be vice sound i'm voice sound
we tried to we use these new features teaches
i did this payment
i need to change to assign these deals that you need to change days face there when the saudis size of the

because they sort of were not too hot not too cold they were
become nowhere techie but
but actually read that the red matched
and then i don't think that's very realistic i

hello so you should be zero actually
and if you specify that in one of your attribute lines then it'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from but
but you know you only work is for short time maybe
for short time maybe in a year or two you would do actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information

says i understand your you he's using all the machines and you're using on a machine yes this enough into it so exactly
you're at home and you're trying to like in it takes
nearly what additional or does enron man and it's a real friends themselves you then i would did
heard the sub mission though where i've been looking on list of big others some missions and

so if you don't want your job to run on a machine were could be evicted then you give it minus that after being you know knowing that and
that it's both case and
visions anyone would be you look at a few things very quickly you pick
the vietnam tool cost more inflammation

does that and they wanted to see given that you're doing that what are the best teachers you use i see
i like fifty with it fifty percent
but you can still find it some kind of fucking mom somewhere
i also some slight me and i just i like mismatch

some kind of understand
one eighty i after that added proposal i mean your occasions you tried just the thing and get and maybe my fishing
but for that her cry too but for christ's or re check everything else and ripped ripken the things and
brent actually it's the far field like

that's one reason maybe could combine
stage and then do something in this i they just take it
little bit senior hasn't heard about what i've been doing
until justice ties getting prepared to take this qualifier exam

so we just put in an order for about twelve new machines to use as sort of a computer farm
we ordered send like one hundred and
and and it there and will duplicate

you can try this as a simple test with the ls commands you can say
knowing that and it'll pick a machine that can't be evicted from
so i don't know that i entirely agree with it but

i don't know whether it monitors to keep order actually looks at the console t. y. so maybe if
no there's like different think
i don't know what happened but

though you're right you probably wouldn't ordinarily i mean you sort of or something
snow sincere and in one of these that way you tell us what's up with you
shouldn't watch this like no

heard the
because we didn't have any speak announcement system it you know so
and plus that i'd just sanity and then i phoned

above and he goes though this again then you read is going to be read then pointed speech it just to get a feel
it just to get a feel how much the base life is going to change biting and find information i just use so people won't even
go they use exactly the baseline system for converting the kept someone to how the speech i mean if

or ecosystem one so
but you do throw something away
and so the question is can we figure out if there's something with right away that we shouldn't

i'm i'm not saying i'm not being clear when i met was
so we just tried to you too just keep intimacy twice
when we like the sticker traction became pros cindy significantly

@reject@ segments vacations but the trust the full
but the trust the full proposal i mean your
i after that added on this issue my fishing so

but for speech recognition it now
many men are they may be different if it really don't matter lot karma they do it on a fifty so
you weren't really union reading anything after that

we should go through these alternatives what we've seen
mississippi state i'm it's just that the state maybe
so that will be a little task in itself

what we've seen so far and come
so far and come up with some game plans you
be actually i did i decent binary feature the gibson just the

he hear some alternate visions anyone
he'll have some ideas and that too
the other thing is too most of this big announcement techniques have reported was it sounds more like everybody else

and you know have sort of two working
but we go into i'd business should generally and then exchange we
all these people have shown improvement know for thing and maybe subsidies up until this but the passion to it

manager or i know that i know
people smoke coming up from the @reject@ trying to do that's right
you're right that's a real good point that we don't know what if any of these i that's why they're pushing

when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the fifty that was going into the filter bank i was thinking so the picking
so the picking on something
that's interesting maybe that helps to drive to the thought process of coming up to features

but it might help in combination
but i have to tell you i can
things in some ways it's bad to have data driven thing so

we we abandon the lapel because they sort
i just think this sport think plainly seems for that's we're doing

it's one less than what's written on the back here
sonata way of doing it maybe would be just to take fifty power spectrum feed into and they're on the

or your channel number
should do a lot of talking so we get a lot more the pronunciation

sense and having indian friends least so we usually do is
least so we usually do is we typically will have our meetings and then at the end of the meetings

sessions are the reads the digits on the bottom of the forms
our nineteen i'm nineteen

uses it my jobs are not getting right so i had
i took have could decide to be day you could be tuned in you but i meet this they don't

but you can also if you have that level
if you have that level of sterilization and you don't want to have to worry about writing the logic in munich pearl script to take care of that you can use he make and just the pavement

at once and then will make that it never goes above that
get it but anyway day

that machine and run your job there
that doesn't have the same sort of behaviors teammate which is that you know your job there

they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console then your machine will get evicted your job get evicted from their machine and be re started on another machine automatically so
the capture the different is like that maybe a slight difference and then they

what about i remember it always used
i remember it always used to be an issue maybe it's not anymore is that if you if something required if you're machine required somebody hitting a key in our to evict things around and see could work

we can't connections but i don't know whether
on something that much has also some it's magic and that which is i others and

and then you probably go screw this
the vet imagine matched be many times

then i would did anything so fun and is it commissions so
like if i come by it but they use the booming what that

art i just phone that
you know so it's just sort saying if you it's not guaranteed though

by this playing the information off the him and will speeding on speech
i've flown that the baseline seven goes by the buzz bozeman by just getting a lot

the consensus is like you would you lose it be given the information i voted the beginning and all speech but the horse
but the horse speeches i live or do you

on our and then i boarded the c. n.
that should get more and it maybe to distinguish between vice on and invite sounds

to jump on for a second so now you're getting tuned into their a story thing things she has here and so
no there's like i'm going to just talk to their so then one distinction is that you were taking actual francetelecom teachers in applying i think

something buffy i we're supposed to look combining something from the offense telecom system with if i just right
but you got some sort of different result some kind of understand

because if we keep the value it twice it made it it doesn't happen till you can remove online
you see the thing is of speech so the difference the kale

or something and see where it where the where they were different and can learn from
but you did you use we think we'd we change just because

like i mean did you eddie you use just because we change it's just into it
i mean did you eddie if it does i mean it's just into it

and it doesn't seem to or some kid each it's mainly
maybe because if other changes

because you don't actually good matches ordinarily for what anybody particular person's car this line or
it seems like something like the middle one is more natural

the idea too then how you have all the training conditions exactly like a persecuted in that icing condition onto it's like
doing it in the beating a couple once more it

it's because beat
it's it's because beat each

it's each edge of righteous conditions but
and a couple of posters away with somebody who compared one to just putting in their fifteen fifty

other and manic energy
like in they gave us the idea that you didn't actually do is anything because

or maybe like maybe other way around
sigma some space the

said i get something about the sars
i mean since winter filter also assumes that you're adding together the two signals how is how does that differ from signal substance

it looks as they leave it that what is enough conditions and in colored noise so
i mean if it especially do civil sexist attraction followed by kale transform followed by

where you don't have third are finalized just the things and i see
it's like a worthy thing to

that was something that every and they were talking about with the multi band if you're converting
if you're converting things too and scripts bands into coffee you local sort of local capture coefficients that it's not that great to do it if it's noisy

the other noise
that kind of the up space approach has i mean it i think it depends on in wording to make this is so you'd like

definite fish spectra subtraction and that no
addition i mean that's or what to do rested does in a way

west of the cut all that noise and then make
all that noise and then make the noise light and

are you ready and
are you ready and

there's one guy and kind of had and another
yes i heard you look in general thing back from and looking at ways to combine one form or another of noise or with these other things we

active suffer recording right now and
that we have for the the quote unquote noisy dated is just noisy and river brent actually it's the far

yes other some adaptation though that
yes though that this has been playing with

i do it i need it to die buffets payment to include these see to dippy we've they without the features
on to it right now and no done that the ones to set it vice i've always vice seasons silence on

and you know maybe if it's used in combination woke and at something that we're missing
that's probably why eat it would be likely to work as by itself

speech conferences and i
saw within very short distance of one another couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired friend and or something and a couple of posters

fifteen fifty just slightly better
select one one thing to like what before we started using as the eighty in this i don't know so what we did was like i most of you know a board is hiding his addiction is speech patterns beat the catch them intending that you know and that

itself or in combination
you know maybe there's something to be gained from it and but

for of it and some this some hot morning
i mean just do it very specifically in

i it i done accumulates or something was
and i'm not what it is i don't know moments maybe

the terrorism mike type wireless

had head say yes

too cold they were you know they were far enough away that you got more background noise and so forth but they weren't so close

but they weren't so close that they got quite the really good not that they

in iraq they were not so far away that they were really good represented this and bikes

them and then if you only had to have one like in some ways you can target the palace good choice precisely because

some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you don't get will tell a little

you're might numbers written on the back of that unit there

so we have how can agenda what's going on

hundred and

you don't actually have to right p. makes trips and things like that the simplest

thing i can send an e. mail around or maybe

how about an e. mail points to the i think you have to have there's a

it there and will duplicate your environment so

yes this enough exactly

he make and just the pavement

number and that number represents how many machines to at once and

you can say run command in your h. t. k. thing and it'll find

the fastest currently available machine and run

but the machines that don't have that attribute if the job gets fired up on that which could be somebodies desktop machine and they were at lunch they come back from lunch

you to lose time right if you had a two hour job and they got halfway through and

got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine i got evicted so if you don't

but if you're logged into it from home

and you weren't getting any keys because you were

i'm not how that works seems

seems like countries did something for that

you probably wouldn't ordinarily though you're right y. so maybe if you echoed something that does console or something

you probably wouldn't ordinarily though you're right does console or something

you're trying to like in it takes forever even though your and then you probably

forever even though your and then you probably

i think maybe i'll ask enough of the meeting

to a really good resource for that

are he knows that

just today if it does i just like in i just

that my dad if we of that i used to us different from what lee's summit in the proposed what

then after other that night added online normalization ozone double that and that

i used because all it has that up mean invading update i'm constant and we

i just phone that i've reviews about it i mean i think it's a time

about the other thing we're tired was i just the baseline and then i'd read the end point and though information just the i don't

i came back up the second i missed

the different don't know what the different accents

so it's too dark and online

so i just stopped there would the of speed and spend the other thing where

spend the other thing where tireless though i didn't go and find information to the baseline and that it's of

and that it's of gives like printed above and he goes though

it i issue is that people do that anyway everybody

so i mean clearly there interacts so i don't know that i

entirely agree with it but it might be in some ways it might be better to president giving in points to have a standard that everybody uses an interaction with but

no that is i exactly i or can you then you speech outside of it for estimating background noise and things

work even better because you don't have the mistakes

base lights of i mean it's it there was like read a book and i phoned that in

said that is and the cosby getting good ideal is they'd use to something people have into something like going if i believe in for the night stand i think they have

stand i think they have actually team to close to getting paid you know

i after that i just went home for i just had a vacation for

and and i that's that's good update

and i came back and i started working on some of the speed enhancement i'd go to them i'm until

i'd go to them i'm until bio from this subdivision or whatever phone the people have died spectra suppression mean if i think these are the main approaches work but i've tried so

work but i've tried so just do just to see the space that some few more speed enhancement i was in just that it and was i've been looking on this sickness upstate approach for speed and been spend

speed and been spend you take the nazis signal and the decomposing no and the noise subsidies and

subsidies and then to estimate that being speech from the sigma personally subsidies

so i've been actually designing sums

so vibrant been thing you don't even match lie about it but

things she has here and so we'll have a place for the is

because you get some that you talked about last week i

if i just i know what it was just a wonder system too or ecosystem

the maintained it just to take the specter subtraction from start to become

i'm going to just talk to their so

but they had i know that back and blind equalize that's i mean but

capture a or something right and

the capture because it's and said they just page beaner fencer and then compute guessing features right

i mean if you're using all their own accord i mean back would be the only difference in and this in a of different

i think we should a table we told the reason because i don't know

these without but which are much education tree jews to do the it edgy theaters in

but what seems clear also use that to we have to june to time constants of town and my patience because

so it sounds like you should look at some tables results or something and see

like sixty four good to

there some minor changes

and it's just like he works for matched

but is not significant but

but if you but they deemed a spreadsheet it's get worse

and significantly better for h. m.

i don't think it's your fault it's important because

because the u. n. improvement r. h. happened but the different contribution i think the different descents it'd be more evenly

m. and that's him i'm going to be huge he affected by so

i don't understand that i i have

that i i have meant part of the discussion so

it seems to me that the match condition it's going to be unusual

mean it doesn't match country and it's not like the whining the idea too then

i also that matched mismatch

like the that i just be like it bows and enough what databases use fourteen and that he was in for testing it's

just sort saying if you it's not guaranteed though

for the main miss my just coming from them or enough noise and the silence things and all those present and the enemies actually again if

so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer you have a car and so you

so some of the proposed and i'm wondering dissing and on that fifty bands other

but i cannot tell you what's which one might be better

proposes ages are you getting them some improvement

that's so doing i mean maybe one or the other things that are doing would benefit from the other happening first

i interesting he's doing a signal substation thing maybe would work

thing maybe would work better if you'd already done some simple spectra subtraction or maybe

if the thing that you see the thing is of speech so the difference the kale

it's cascade elf those generally don't that's

the call waiting's matrix off the noise

so they get a dog is like they do any english fitting west

if you look at what their rest is doing essentially it's it's equivalent to sort of adding a little asthma

us and then if implementation of he kissed techniques

so it's picked or ten dollars series that they're use to to too remote though the confirmation speaking clean get to try and he gets or

what if you take the stand on mother enough this noise like it's and in any r. e. a transformation into concerned i mean

there's a way to approach me d. c. first or second order dinner series in

working concerned i mean

of had and another or in

of had and another or in who sent the name it's it i cast

from seeing do they do i watched on t. v.

it's again different things that could be tried

one it seems like one of the things to go through next week when our shirts her

when our shirts her i was on ideas too or

too or i not next week and a half

very quickly you pick on something that looks like it's promising and

another thing would be to have to pick tupac two possible things and

things and you know have sort of two working things for a while so we figure out what's better than

she does is maybe a few people have reported something on using some id is speech i

some when i was looking at somebody of the on speed enhancement apply to logic of it does and

mean i just get this issues in terms of

but it you know we did we it helped

helped that something so

what most again most of our work has been done with that with

but we have recognition now with some of the continuous speech

speech can't really continue speech using switchboard so the switchboard recognize or

i just think this sport think from this just plainly seems for that's

i that's why they're pushing that in the in the valuation

i meet this they don't cough which she saw it

panic i so you probably need to back up a bit though

i made sides doing to it on there new but i mean there's face in that but i mean there's they caught today though

of it's your cost days day spectrum of the scene not on your crafting

not on your crafting know that's i do class that opened up the measures they're bound to kind

funded if anti dividing us up these decided because

of the of the i know his windows sucks

and she's people blink siphon be stuck on it

it's something is funny to me but but

to me but but nothing if you got to

whatever's that's interesting maybe that

with what targets

know that just the same way we're using in the same way they were using the filter bank phones

so to me i mean the filter bank is good for all the reasons we say it's good

and maybe you know using course you know kelpie or adding probabilities i mean all those different ways that we can find ways that we would let the essentially but in their own network determine what is it that's useful

but there's so much very addicting and bars but

i have to tell you i can remember the conference but he

but he it's about ten years ago i remember going to one of the speech conferences and

but again we have these wonderful statistical mechanisms for quantifying that that very ability and you know doing something reasonable with it so

it's the same you know a argument gone both ways about you know we have these data driven filters you know the a

and the other hand it's data driven means it's driven by things that have lots of very ability and they're necessarily not necessarily going to be the same in training and test

so in some ways it's good to have data driven things in some ways it's

say we just the thought that if we had that maybe it's just a baseline

but maybe their own that nature them's configured up quicker than you

and we tried to this just

but in a christian she's enlarged within speech can be get some teachers

europe dripping information that can might be useful didn't speech and it

doing you know sticking

doesn't work finding the high don't know moment self and i'm

maybe have commitments to

moments you so no and they're all work is in some sense equivalent to computing you know higher order moments inflation

i mean just do it very specifically

you're anyone talk about
