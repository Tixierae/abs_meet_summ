we are all switched on all right all
on the same form we need a separate form but anyway
a separate form but anyway i'd like to added a little and think that initial saying i don't want to see the final transcript but other
that it was about an hour and ten minutes
and an hour it's we have a complete english sponsored that does everything determine first us and
so this sentence is isis the same output just think person property
say have a running here so if i and go i see
so if i do this now you can see that it promised the wonderful conditions and switch phones are on this and i'm cinema today evening but
on the cinema or running in the cinema which
showing i've seen that at the cinema
i change that five actually when it's on my account you want this evening i see what there which is on tonight
as and one thing i was wondering was
business would you do to change to get the x. amount of changed so what it a
so what it a concert and conquer stay
i think that's right i think it's actually that looks like it's state modification it's going to change
where is it's playing that should also be a reference to something maybe
plans of interest to them the weight
this you know better but it's probably a good idea to lick to minimize the number of change requests we make of them so it seemed
we suggest yes i it improvements in description
as this whole framework problem that i'm feeling really uncomfortable by
and i haven't had a chance to think about it but
about it but i want to do the early rather than late
and sort of we don't know how to handle them to right i mean it's
we don't know how to handle the declared of forms really and
cases that we had from last year we first thought about this domain actually was that most
was that most of the things we talked about our story understanding and have a short
we want with it being once d. have fulfilled these requirements
as so i've been in contact with move so probably
find lacks prejudices like you know touch or
which means that this is this even if you don't really know anything but it's right
the important point is that there's it's a general kind of idea of short cutting the full c. p. t. flow conditional
and up you but at some point in life i i think
right so there's no numbers there's just
especially whatever it's probably stick leave whatever would be and it's just it's not a great

are they're going to try and say it's the german data from the t. v. and some of for ontario so
i have known that too
place the
them there were other actions that it's seemed is that state variable somewhere like
it's actually that looks like it's state modification
it's it's under underwent subtype you're doing it
seen it runs around looking for discourse status tags
can understanding what's going on then and
route adam ends
or the right the restaurant where they were later hose and that is that other
if you're great amounts model problem in here it's
that's interesting is in a sort of over arching story we worked it out for the as you say this the storytelling scenario
and the one for next summers just half down and the other half
down and the other half is this generation thing which we think is much different so once that
down and the other half is this
and we can do all sorts of things that don't fit into their framework at all
but there's no obligation on the news
no do me doing sensitive information extraction and
so call that we want to have this kind of structure in our business
the typical example is that these are all a bunch of q.'s for something and this
for something and this is in the fact that like to conclude
like let's just look at the kids were in this is actually be find lacks prejudices
answer do you approach right so is this
so i mean we like to take all these various cues right so this one might like i only
right that's one of the problems is because we're the wherewithal come from is

right so before we get started with the technical part i just want to review what i think is happening with thee our data collection so wheeler still
activate those classes x. files
was always it's whenever i just say right it was ever put this in here
but it to speak english and there
i asked them whether or not we could a
it seems to me that some notions were missing
we have to think that our it in this problem is interesting but just
but its abstracts or newspapers something like this but
if you looked like you it's just that the goals
and have a short discourse and
so this what is it the basics of it as the teal to get us to do but it's not a big so you become
like that because it might be a good right that's true to have in general for problems that you know month though but you know
was a little embarrassing because all this was in his thesis
because all this was in his thesis and i was honor's thesis
that doesn't was actually one of the examples he's got in there
anyways skipping the question of exactly which functions
it's clear that you might like to be able to shortcuts the whole conditional probability type
for this they did basements in general are quite good at saying if you have no current information about this variable just take the prior for that
they're really what i know there seems to kind of i mean you don't need that data enough to cover nearly as much

bought i just want to make we're all together on this what
and then to be a certain number of hours during the week which she will be available and we'll
but we'll start with that in parallel
we also considered using the berkeley high school and the their teachers maybe
mentioned
to get it or is was it easy to get it
so in a sense it's pretty broad
it gets that from that's correct
i think that's right i think it's actually that looks it's going to change
right such a short time
will be so did you understand is very simple the you have
no i think the i think the idea is sad
to not only an hour for a but
or you know the church across in city hall or kind of didn't
the whole isn't really relevant that we are getting mostly with sort of questions
if the things that i'm mark you know that was another thing that says it's
so no you a funny way of referring to speak lies
whatever so noise yard my paranoid

nothing was special thought specified except
does those assumptions action to buy into one right i they actually
this is where it takes it all in syntax
converts it somehow
this is sort of what happens business would
so once that and all the rest of it is sort of you know what we want the research
if we can use all they execution engines than we can you know really try things that would be too much pain to do ourselves but there's no obligation
a particular piece of this big system
which in german takes these two sentence templates and produces x. m. l. structures
and one of our jobs was to make the english equivalent of that
that these guys did in a day
the other thing is at the other end roughly at the same level there's something that takes x. m. l. structures produces an output x. m. l. structure which he is
and then after that as synthesizer that goes from an x. m. l. structure too language generation to actual specifications for synthesizer
i you could partially issues
probably just as easy i this
all right would not be able to observe
that would actually isn't that always this isn't a noisy or anymore
that would actually isn't that always you are supposed to think of isn't a noisy or anymore

on this what we think it's going to happen is that in parallel starting about now we're going to get say to where are you working with me robert draft a note that we're going to send out to various cog psych another classes saying here's an opportunity to be a subject contact
and we'll bring in people roughly
people roughly how many robert
in parallel with that we're going to need to actually do the script
and so i it's a plane ever meeting friday afternoon with jane and maybe liz and whoever on actually getting the script worked out but
then we won't do that spring break so
meaning conservatives gymnastic classes preschooler parents
preschooler parents and so forth
and that's next to but we'll get
really was that straightforward it be for me and
so they be not everyone reach german so if you
probably just partially issues this
you can put the microphone in your pocket
whereas in this case is that piece of this ceases says fifty for this right you
right so it's also more or less like although it isn't necessarily some it's you know some of weights or anything like that i mean you could

not a lot but that's the point
that that's not a lot point
there's a future called disco start and one was a feature
do it now what's the state of the art tough getting two entrances what's
what's the syntax for that time got getting too
so that the databases she which
and if we want to answer a question on that we actually have to go one step before that and understand that
there was describing the
but like i don't want to tell you i haven't heard that before
long right to see a mark if
be for example they could be time of david's keys
this assuming that the skew was turned on and the other one just didn't apply
lies is only one instance this

or really no there's no end
to the complexity you can build and to the what the in heidelberg might ask
know your proper names and descriptions and
it and this is it seems to me that we should maybe i do spend a session over bring some of the better or whether that's a special case in that sense
looked like you it's just that the goals are very different cases that we had from
there's no reason why we're constrained to do that if we can
and much more interesting is the fact that they started doing as we are you know inheriting this system and does all of these other things that's great
so we were incessantly probably these we
it and you got one robert i don't

so we're looking for a total of fifty people not necessarily was a sort of a first
but i'll just make the first draft of the no it's the
it's the last part if you agree to participate love the opportunity to have anything excise would you prefer not to have included in the data set
that i didn't measure that it was about an hour
the you have a wrapped and you got
reference although the to get out of the language may not be trivial there aren't
that i sent a message saying here's a way to take
one thing you could do which is kind of in a way stupid is take this determining stick function and use it to build the c. p. t.

and people look at them some subjects next door
and we were i was afraid that
what's going on then the next thing we talked about is actually thing out how to add her own tags and like that
and as a sport it's sort of this the structure of the map requests
action and it's important to worry about the language and but
necessary but not right
read it so you should take a look how you can you stick with it
so you should take a look and up you but at some

really simple this is sort of the parameters we have
no matter how we want to call it there's a sort of alternate and
but you know it depending what people are interested in one could have two hours one could
hours one could have explanations of why something is you know why was this done or really no
and then the and rugged reforms
and the paper i think
so i gave buster copy of this sort of ninety two paper it and

object where you where years and in some points of interest in on the
know your proper and that's aspirin
talk to i know i'll get some
what i think i'm going to try to do
what we want and that's where it gets difficult and i
so i gave
than all that right that things can many of a function that combines them in

up in this meeting this should be you know there's a there's another thing going on of gathering data and
just can understanding compete understanding and
got the n. c. out for the routes today i
said i got some more this is sort of
so you guys will send to the rest of us a version of this
it's difficult but i

so i mean lately and have them because
to even though the generator is a little bit more complex
that means they may need two hours and twenty minutes from time in our ten minutes
and the next thing i would like to be able to do and it seems like this would not be too difficult either is to say that's not will pretend we are actually wanted to not only change the mapping off of words really unfair but we also wanted to change and he was sentenced i've been could make up
into the picture or try
whoa look at that but

think jesus functions act in the context of structure
great so this is just plain it's a design
plain it's a design thing not a political thing once
put him i missing here and then maybe it was just me being stupid is i didn't get the notion of the government of the whole route really
so it seemed to be what we ought to do is get our story together
and think about something internally before asking them to make changes

so probably after today that shouldn't come up in this meeting this
it's just specifications
this is important but what again it's kind of almost managerial point
and then there's the language generator and then after that as
move so probably let's put the doctor like i do i understand better what do you do was a little embarrassing

right up north in it to you and say and then
what did you end up having to do and
sentence just think person property
that's just giving these all body which they may not be for example they could
that's what they do and they use in that paper

i we have we concluded that these forums are sufficient for us unnecessary
i think they're necessary
this and this of course is just the action and it
i've got a couple new papers as so i've maybe
they're really what i know there seems to kind of never old i aside these basements to cover nearly as much

accepted but munich everything is fine now
now transcribed are they're going to
so at least unless somebody else wants to suggest otherwise i think the general domain we don't have to broadened
this person heidelberg
but just to confirm part of tower an object i id in the database is also not pretty trivia

and the reason was that the posse completely ignores the burp
we are we can attempted i attempted before
it you medically are facing the switch
are facing the switch rooms are showing i've seen that at the cinema
they also seem to affect state to some of

right which is means of ten the system to shut down
so that's funny you bury this state in the function
all the entities do have concrete reference although
when you'd add up the total evidence for thee and hey i don't
think you do this because jesus function from that

but just automatically initialized things are common right such a short
so no this kind of do anymore
for a but more generally the this whole issue of referring expressions and
formed because there is an apology
so the idea is that let's call these want to see two c. three and c. four and eat for and effect

or tell or this or that building or unique
where you say how you know how do i get back
and i think it's really worth thinking through what it looks like what
and jumping out of windows and tons of
it escalated so it's also

and b. problem that we're having was that you know given and know what this to the n.
given and know it's and for the thought of the see things here we need to specify see times to the in probably these that
the distinguished disinterested entity you know if there's something for the person talking about did mission see
so depending on what your situation is their different functions which are most appropriate and
one of the questions is my prosper is how much of this job the base support

we know so we're fifty was a sort of a first
that it creates this
nothing comes out of here
and here it is the more interesting classes their ballots

so if you happen to be sort of in a non students social stacking and you know people
and every step as if i'm up checked where you start to object where you
right i think that's one of the things that's interesting is as many logical
that's why they invented pocket peace

just the permission form
there's one tricky part about
now that we had to be included for this other one which
other one which might have meetings you know about something in this case

about it could be this evening which ones are on the cinema or running
so the idea is that you have these untreated no it's right you one
so this right you one you too eat three eighty before
so this is the heck run paper you're working with good eighty before

actually it's a little tricky in that there's some allowable german orders which aren't allowable english orders and so forth and it is order
in the business looks to me like a function call right
so whenever i it's it encounters goodbye
there but did you i think that would be great to cross

i change that five actually when it's on my account you want to get it or is this evening i see what there which is on tonight
i can't stand it
again there's one module in which there's one piece that we have to convert english right
because we don't have the access to the information

i saw this actions the goodbye somewhere
right so this one might be say new terminology
so if we ever want to wonder what the french it seemed to be not be able to obsessive know
what the french it seemed to be not be able to obsessive know that's find that

that function automatically generates an initialized eczema structure think jesus
it seems to me that this way of doing it this other prospective step backwards from the way we've done it before it seems to me
so this is his specially is preference
at so specifically in this case you have to have this many numbers whereas in this case is

us is a one i was advocating some tax for actions scheme and true mister approach
in what we want to request now it's going to leave enough space to do all that right now
isn't that isn't real hard and
and one of the questions

and the approximate anyhow is the default
especially if we want sort
hose and that is that that would be fine right
not precisely what we want and that's

the problem isn't the short red grange optimization it's
it's just sort of one or two year kind of thing
be say but like new terminology
and the final thing is that this is a domestic function of these

right now but that requires some thought
if touch or
if you've right answer
just have to see what function this is right

out but what i'd like to it's is this too i say start recruiting in parallel and possibly start running subjects next week after
week after the spring break and people
and so that sounds like a great thing to do as the priority item

do the same thing which is we going to check out our social infrastructure for possible subjects meaning
we love the way the actuality action goodbye maps into something
where those constrictors to find

you know about something in this case it doesn't really make sense
departure time oscar went to class and when she came back there was finished
if it's it disco discourse initiative phrase we would have nothing in the discourse astray what

i do sentences in the city i mean the these are
know to today evening i'm too evening
right i think that's one of the things that's interesting is they're just course patterns probably don't follow quite as many logical

and you can have it many variations in the sentences deal suppliers fine
you give me an example you know worlds on that story carry hours trappings
you give me an example of a reference problems of liking

and so this means
this and see i've not optional
they also seem to affect think jesus functions act in the context of structure and changes in some way from example batting feel to it or something

so if i know their rights goodbye but to do that it
not a numbers value
so this is offensive for we have stinky fault so

sometimes it sometimes they find somebody person
some other and i suggested that they should maybe good kind enough to do two things for us is a one
and so you other guys can decide how interested isn't

thing once we can just sort of agree on what ought to be done
i mean i we could take all the standard metaphor examples in the question versions of them
i don't want to tell you i haven't heard that before

time got getting too stepsons and calculating dose on the spot
you know to talk about this
that's especially that we should have

no this is important but
five and they want to approach it probably point one day
right so they up with these little tables each of those

then with some suggestions about where do we go from here
i've got a couple paper i think maybe
so it is in each of these t. i. is resents walked this would be if all the other ones when distinguished it right so for example

and the scope of this is beyond approach and this service this is
and this service this is
this is everything that you know we might want to do in the next couple of years

or you know the church across in city get some kind of didn't
or you got kicked out of friends
packages or say hope parse or there's a particular piece

let's say that by the end of spring break i'll try to come up with some story about construction grammar and what constructions
and what constructions we use and how all this might
and how all this might get together as this whole framework

if you're discourse and the person talking is trying to i don't know give you a statement tell you something in here it's
one time but i if part of what i haven't figured out yet is how all this goes together so they
together so they got some more from the time

what it looks like what is the same spec mean
et cetera right because for a while we're thinking how can we change the dated to sort of illicit actions that are more like what we are used to but
i don't know i mean maybe that's what we'll do used to but we would rather you know try to figure out what

so is that makes sense to everybody also
also buff and i will do something of which i may kindly ask you to do the same thing which

i mentioned
and again it's just a question of which of these things people want to died into

the final transcript but other than that one's been approved this
this really is the same project

but i the good use of last week the parts or
i started working on departure time

right we the first thing we did is we tried to do dude changed the house and into yvonne running or runs that
and we noticed that whatever we tried to do it had no effect

if you get attached to day and evening at that time or not and it's and the time right
if you get attached to day and it's and the time right

does look get that but all the rest just simply frosting on the cake and
so it that these optional elements it's actually a set it is not

today evening if anything happening in this in the mud this evening keywords
keywords

this the reserve anyways
is it is something that even mole scary how did you get to the said beating i still talk to

is what i had to do i had to change be offensive to
you mean that summer actually my fantasy but

this into movies cinema
movies cinema keynote a cinema

next to but we'll get to that in a second
i they actually i didn't want to be called

actually watch
except that it has some references to audio visual media here maybe the

so what is set they right
but there one was this percentage signs right

and the value of the score is i assume i the more of these outcomes things actually in there the higher their score it is that's the main purpose
it's difficult but i think we don't need to get beyond it terrorists in heidelberg it

and it's very flexible
and that's hope that the generation will not be more difficult to even though the generator

it's be great to be i've been could make up some senior i'm it's she
be great to be a good exercise to just see whether one can get that to run it's she

so where does those assumptions action
that whatever it takes is in three was it actually changes the state not

how they present it in the courts of sir
i mean it's some seems very puzzling in some sense where we will be like you to not be hopes so of some of this because we

it has these spies sheets and also the scheme of time sort of probably
sort of probably does is it takes the

variable somewhere like that discourse status confer
i thought i should talk a little like that because it might be

it function called hearted nor to put goodbye and content but confirming teachers
because so it's not just a adding that feel it's

mystery functions
sometimes it sometimes they find somebody person

on you know it you can see it on the solution and
and what's the other one so they're just you know with the agendas and the

so they said did your friends back it you email these that
and what is it that they're actually dealing with in the world

you email so this is not a complicated negotiation that we're doing this
so this is not a complicated negotiation this is we're doing this

i'll talk we can do it now what's the state
what it looks like what is the same spec mean et cetera right

days wherever you find a route planner and does nothing but get to the closest part where the street network is at minimum distance with your budgets and
we suggest yes i it improvements and be description

to you guys that i mean you're doing the interactions but it seemed
the interactions but it seemed to me that what we ought to do is come up with a something where you

and then having to an iterations within our group saying
and get our best idea of what we should add

sort of what i might feeding was we sort of reserve something that hasn't and naval that's
naval that's that was my first sort of step

heidelberg it seems to me we can get all the complexity we want in actions and in language without going outside of course in heidelberg
so and then here you are it's the person is getting information and they may or

i just thought i'd be surprised that
that there's any important issues that

we have just commission someone to translate some bits of it i eat
it i eat the just the more general descriptions of all the objects and persons and events so it's

and events so it's a relation to the rest of perseverance and objects
you know think that would be great to cross referenced problem really is not trivial even if you have such a defined worlds

something or maybe we should address one of these days is too did most of the work people actually always do is look at some statements and analyze
and analyze

house
house

or you know walk why he twice you pushing for promotion or of friends right
or you know walk why of friends right

or was pushing proof just pick
just pick any of them and just

yes eat i so and then here
and i think it's really worth thinking through

so we want to turn it into a understand any stories about heidelberg can do that
it is it this is was viewed as a kind of a minor thing

and tons of so
and i think that's the standard way people get around thee

the sort of and i would take up that responsibility
and get a first draft of that no we

and i was honor's thesis committee
and so i even really knew this one time but i

actually the idea first all is that each of these things has quote unquote distinguish state which means that this
so for example if we were you know if the thing is a lot of money or not or if that just doesn't seem relevant then that would be so distinct the distinguished disinterested

but none of the other confusion usually apply
be this is just represent probably should be should have this assuming

so you know design mark and not isn't really profitable then this would represent probably shouldn't maybe this case
maybe this case maybe we just maybe decide that if the things that i'm marking we don't know anything else i'm going to include that they want of you would probably be you know point for they want entered

and our example g. would be majority vote
so the important point he is not what the g. function is

you got one robert i don't know who else has seen it there's i mean
it's i come in and breeze

and what i sent out about a week ago with an idea of how to do that for evidence combination so one of one function
estimate but it's the best when you have

no i'm saying is numbers there's just quickly but this and if it's if you
there is a even if you decide what is appropriate is probably the government's combination you can write a function that doesn't

so we all switched on

and that's pretty much independent of this bought

contact say

people not necessarily by any means all students but we'll start

then we if they would not be here for spring break so

they also sometimes a flexible schedules so if you

stacking and you know people may be interested in being subjects we also

that's a good idea and get them interested in

that's so that's as far as our brainstorming was concerned

and money also copy jane

so what i'd like to do is also have our subject sign a waiver saying i don't want to see the final transcript if they

if they don't if they said no i'm not willing to sign it then shows show the final transcript but

so much for the data

they all seem to be happy happiness but that's

you move on to the technical besides

we can show end up having to do and what was or anything interesting about at all ever going to see

we can show interesting about at all ever going to see

even if you fine it's aw it on of this basic i see

this basic need feature film and t. v. that's today

said it does look get that but all

and this optimum for that part for

so you should you i going to show us the little templates

actually it's a little tricky i've read so i've more or

and so forth and it is order based so

it's actually a set not a sequence

really is who really is keyword matching

so wonderful parts same thing

accepted we don't have this time information here now which is

the reserve anyways so

these of sort of the ten different sentence types that he the parcel was able to do

and just it snow in english

you have already started to make it a little bit more in that birthright

i mean she's the sentences to make it more in attic

so you and look at the time so that's they're conveniently located in a fight templates

to today you know to today

capitalize as and

one thing i was wondering was those functions there are those things that modified m. t.

so the point is if it says this and see it also work and see in this

but those two keywords it right

but i don't know where it gets it from see

have them because if you didn't happen

because it gives you a score

it is that's the main purpose

i think what it does something some offensive notes

where'd actually produces p. d. x. amount of d. parts

so whatever this in the business

which we can make it store in the second here

so that's going to be a call on the discourse and confirm

and confirm that it's you mean that summer

i think that's right i think you mean that summer actually my fantasy but it's going to change

there's a future called disco start and it's whenever one was a feature

then because it may be that all those things they look like function calls are just a way of adding exactly that to the x. m. l.

big goodbye causes it to create in action goodbye and action

know if we know what that writes produces feature discourse status confirmed discussed artist so if i know

confirm goodbye

but there's some kind of function called hearted

doesn't speak german anymore but it to speak

english and there is here a reference

so this status us that whatever is has the idea zero is referenced here the restrictions seed into the picture

what's the sentence

we changed and so we you know we add something to the disc or status that the user wants to change something that we're sort of done before

and that whatever is being changed has something to do with the cinema

narrative discourse maintain or

and other people's northers tax

so i definitely think it's worth the exercise of trying to actually add something that isn't there

so this is somewhat i got today is the then you'll i'm three out for the maps

and dressing like samples so this to see

so this to see x. amount as a sort of what it would look like later on you know

it's not very interesting

and again as he thought it's really simple this

we have the found objects into objects and so forth

so they said did your so these

this is not seven committees or anything right no this

or anything right great so this is just no this is very words

a wrapped and you got it up in different pieces

and every element of that every second week on about them and

and so for me to be we cut up in three different steps

and also since you had suggested that we figure out if we ever find them a reason wanted to got directed to the g. i. s. and the planner

that's all they do with these days wherever

you're in the midst of this you know better but it

is it just makes sense to you guys that

and i don't know who smoke working with closely and probably

take what they have

send it to everybody saying this is what they have this is what we think we

and then go back to that

are i don't know it just makes sense to you or

right that's right so and if we get something in there that is a structure in elaborate and and complex enough to prove maybe enable the whole simulation one of these days that would be the perfect was

so the problem isn't the perfect was

kind of thing this class of things we think we like try to do in a year or two how

two how would we try to characterize as in what we want to request now

change the description to english

about the language and but for the moment just for the class of things we might want to try to encompass

we don't i mean that's an issue we don't know what

an issue we don't know what

that i just this x. m. l. here just has to do with source past goal type

in terms of traveling through heidelberg or right

or travel specifically right

so but the so is the domain greater than that

and it's something somebody comes up with that can't be done that way then whoa look

i mean if you want to pushes into reference problems that would be great

and you know what are these things referring to not only

and again this is like in the database this is also pretty formed because there

and the database and so

and so it isn't like you know the evening star or like that

there aren't really deep mysteries abouts what things the system knows about i

can have both problem and the descriptions and that's aspirin

a lot and after for and pronouns and

we have the whole impressionable databases in german we have

of liking making more concrete how do i get to the potter tower

of liking making more concrete how do i get to the potter tower

to do a small something

your do we ever find metaphor because he was questions in that sense that it

i don't think it's at all difficult to convert them to question forms it really exist and people say all the time

if you're great amounts model problem in here it's

information and they may or may not be following some larger plan you know that we have to recognize or in for

i effect we need and free tickets ten your perspective we need to do that they

assuming we have this and we tend in that case that you do have these wonderful stories and historical anecdotes and

this has been deep that researchers actually there was is part of the on to do isn't something for the future is how can we sort of run our taxes are content turing machine that will enable i say that too retrieve for answer questions what sensibly

so this is what happened is there's

is there's this there was describing

the there's two packages or say

which he is instructions for the generator

difficult and i don't pretend to understand you know what i think we really ought to do

you guys that have started fighting on the base that noisy or front

and so when we just do thee

i was in being you in your pocket because i don't have one

exactly that's why they invented pocket peace

namely that you have you know it's that several times right so

you've right answer

that he is but they see that's what someone mentioned admission fees

it's always or not at the moment

be time of david's keys you could say you know morning afternoon evening night so it this could be

and it's hard probably spent here which is kind of a pain

so noisy always way to sort of vila this

you know if they didn't talk what that would be the distinguished it

so for example that was a person i mean what the thing that they talk or the non market but none of the other

they want entered would probably the would probably point five and

so we can let this be gee if you want come eat too e. t. before and our

flow conditional probability table with some function

which would you choose appropriately for each case so depending on

so you read it how you

it's a good question

it's a good question out so we wanted java support that you mystic functions and

right so the little handout and in a sense it said we can make it supported by nine or the answering you know probably that one and it was right

right so the little handout that little thing that i sent a message

so it but holidays won't do it for you that

that you can convert all that into what the c. p. t. would be

so one of one function that you could use is your g. function isn't as evidence combined you just take

you just take the if each of the ones has his own little table like that then you could take the strength of each of those times it's little paper when you'd add up the total

so that's what the real good at so if you don't

at so if you don't have any information but the discourse you just use your priors of whatever the discourse

and it's just it's not a great estimate but

that they're good at the other problem is how do you feel in all these numbers and

and i think that's what he was getting at so specifically in

this right you have to have just three and

pretty quickly

have i like the function really is one that's essentially says take the max

once their ways of
