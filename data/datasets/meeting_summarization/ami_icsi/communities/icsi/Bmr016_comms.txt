liz would like to elicit different on x. and
x. and so we tried last week with them right now in english and it just didn't
you want different preside like so if you always had
it seems like that might be better for you guys since then
how about over so zero as six one and if people make mistakes we
and just means we have to expand our vocabulary out to that we already have that's fine with me as long as it's just that
i mean we've it we can do this for awhile and then go
do this for awhile and then go back to digits for awhile or
so i can just this group but if we can try it
not as connected numbers right and you can give an example
and that right liz
right makes sense so if we did another forty hours recordings going to get another couple hours of this
menus uses up in some sense but
then it said something about t. no it's not the same
i just roughly look at what kinds of digit strings are out there and
neil daisy probably only had three sequences and telephone numbers were less cohort so
a real problem with that actually i mean it's the same microphone
i mean for the city right and so i still like the idea of having some kind of
the signal processing far afield i see it as the place that we start but
we talked about that a couple times and i know it's weird but
the problem i see with trying to do over laughing digits is the cognitive load
sixty one would these are all the same forms
so you read the last line all read the first line so but so play you plug your ears
all read the first line so play you plug your ears
i you plug years you could do but then you
but the actual fact that there's speech coming from two people and being forming stalled
and being forming stalled the acoustic
i think maybe if we wanted to do way but i think having a little bit might at least be fun for somebody liked and play around
senses because it's like an entire sketchy does and i
if you have a hard copy what're you that's about the summary
but this is morgan has this paper i mean
but it's been of been mail where was
but it's been of been mail where was did a lot of work on that and it's
i the other any thing is it shows for that the look how you know within speak air is bad and it's bad
so bad and it's bad because it picks up the overlapping speech
so you're raise our results for on the all synchronized speech yes
i think because that's all that had been transcribed at the time
that you had about the altar over all the channels or mix channel or right that's
because of an assertion
answers and aren't bounded so with a
not that we were going to do it but we wanted to know
and he said flown flew but we wanted to know what would need to be done and
have so far so these synchronized cases where there overlapped and
the other people right or who's at any point in time who's the foreground speaker who's the background
so it would be it so it the idea is to run this on the whole meeting
speaker names speakers in
in m. and another meeting and it's we
and it's we just need to standardize
i didn't know that so the only question is how much of that distinction even scratch
right distinction even scratch and on scratches whether it's backed up or not so
right up or not so what you want to do is use the scratch for you can regenerate
that isn't backed up it's not a big deal because
i right be backed up but all the way form sound files should not be backed up the ones that
so i mean i they get the question was then she we shorten them down sample them or keep them in their original form
i mean overall our data we want to knock down sample you want to not
to recognize or and throw out ones that we're not using and so forth and those
it's better if they're chopped out and
yet you we could probably write something to do that but it's actually
find that time boundaries and
i don't think that's really so in principle you could do that but its
of houses in memory you can do extremely fast is but the other thing is that
so we're my me afterward and all
the comet let's just take one example
because was a prude or film actually i it was in a place i didn't expect
that's true if they are seeing argue duty often that's right it has a different probably
that's true duty often it does hard part it has a different probably
because there were some speakers that didn't definite gays but right now
all the e. same and then we have this additional non native version of like a
all the e. h. i've seen it them like that they've been like a
listen to me doing it just because i don't think it would be fun to make them on taj of it because it
performance artistic strength at all it's really right
except for that last thirty minutes haven't checked yet c.
this found the severity eight
although
@reject@ what are you saying it's pronounced the same as the for so
name like someone had debra cannons name and since you know what that is
funny of course now that the ten correct the spelling check
adam i so it's been changed so exactly that's for the like
subtext anyway so they're vocalists nation came in k. brought it down right
have there various things like breeze versus breath versus inhale and you
is for the numbers test i may change it to digits i mean it was i said command
mean it was i said command you can really just change it however you want because
but in any case numbers in is are part of this digits testing
in so example the very first one

through them and pick out the ones that have problems
them together so it just sounded like many more lines instead of anything else so
you have to be no but to the groupings are randomly generated
no but i was asking if that was something you really care about because of it wasn't generated
care about because of it wasn't it seems to me if you made it really specifically telephone groupings that maybe people wouldn't agree with the number so much
i agree think i'd be that hard three them as single digits
it's actually unclear right now i just thought we're
if you so we can know from the trance or what the person said in the transcriber in general but if they make
if people say a hundred instead of one and
what's an example of of the other difference any
any different the individual
and not just that i mean the it's and the notation
and not just that i mean the it's and the notation
i see thread speech and i thought we're going to do better on that's not
some it would go fast
paying for something like that would be better off doing like it i don't know
and so the wreck you know they're error rates because of an assertion
and he we've given him the data we have so far so these
so because right now we're not able to actually report on recognition in a real paper like
so in a real paper like a years pay for because it would look
it and then try to figure out where they're speaking based on the other people right or who's at any point in
it would be techniques used from adaptive echo cancellation which i
it just cancellation which i don't know enough about to talk about
past this is here two males
i didn't notice that that's why
so we want to put very point i'd leave all the transcript should be backed up but all
the sri friend and won't take a and a large audio file name and then a list of segments to chop out from that large audio file they actually have
speakers and all the non native speaker and all the man and all the women right you can grab everything with the word and it's
the point sows for example you know along these are long you
way the way they're doing it you have that already extracted this embedded in the file
mix files and it didn't seem to be any problem quickly i agree
you read about the back of being a bottle neck is good
my husband you but someone told me that in fact cousins treated differently and it in this context because of that
tonight and then every it will actually later today going
@reject@ seven i need to listen to that one actually we gave this char pronunciation person she's like i don't know
did she hear this did she actually hear it because i only heard no we just
else until i knew maybe it's art
or if you're steeper
but i'm a little hesitant to collapse cross categories months actually this
where is that if it's questioned something
disaster like did you use replacements for all the different forms of to this i've
limit yes so that's the single existing convention for
although the what's there's one of the slash after that's kind
that's kind of disturbing that's
of disturbing have to look at it that's i look for that one i actually
no i look for that but that doesn't
but that doesn't actually exist and maybe
which shouldn't be called they wasn't fifty c. of course
i see then following that is called t. c. l. i
i see i forget what the
take always pronounced tickle
@reject@ the same it's pronounced the same
that we need to make we have the misspell if it doesn't
misspell if it doesn't get correct we have to other pronunciation as a misspelled word in the dictionary things like that
i that's what gets like pick those up and the frequency check
right so if there's things that get corrected before we get them it's not an issue if there's
an issue if there's things that we changed later then we always have to keep are the dictionary up to date and then
that and then in the case of tickle i we would just have a word p. c. l. which
addiction normally would be an acronym you know t. c.
but just has another pronunciation
sixties is one of those that sometimes people pronounce it sometimes i see aside so
see aside so those that are listening acronym i actually know they were
know they were said as letters the others
and until they've been listen to they say is i see is
it's gray it's this it was
check because you see b. been you right
however sometimes people stumble over these numbers are saying see
i grab minus the nuns and so you could do grab mine is being so

we've gone once it that so
so we could just put in thee instructions read them as digits numbers right be the missing that
instructions read them as digits right be the missing that just so
just so sixty one was red as six one and if
not presentation no we're
no we're not we were running adaptation only on the data that we ran recognition on
and i as soon as someone surgery transcript number that thread speech and i thought
i see that's not fair to use
that's true fair to use but it might be fair
that's true but it might be fair to use the different stations so
i mean for the city acoustic research for the signal
i can understand a single thing guys the same and that probably was great finally
or theater art i just write three once you could pick one in the middle
right so we can't shortening but we can downtown
and they were loading the full mix files and it very quickly
down farther but
really calls or are they losses so like there's
so like there's call t. c. l.
because we've been say t. c. l. a satirical and
as the for so i think it's the language model that makes a difference what i meant
of these are me that deep i said with a high tech high he sees he said get
peeping out perfect we

just wise around like and row like what do you call it blair
dawn you had disk space and storage formats is that something
this is all just temporary otherwise you're just accessing
but not the way solidly fellas there very long time
derrick you could i just back up a little bit and please please
through this in order so if we could maybe and stick keep that for second because
but our meetings people because
except separate there id on right
i so from the point of view of
too and i haven't listened to it systematically maybe with
any case that says this is reduced down from really quite a long much longer list and this this is great
that's good longer list and this is this is great this is really
that's good is functionally pretty this is really helpful
functionally pretty you know also it was fascinating really helpful
it was fascinating i was listening to some of these i two nights ago and it's just hilarious
and i do have a stress marker here sometimes
and i'm i got lost here what
disturbing models will have to also go through the transfers
letters the others it those really do need to be listen to because i haven't right
it's gray it's this mimicking sound had to hold like in place
you have the numbers and you have the full form an apprentice however sometimes people
so there were vietnam's tag on those so in india

so what that means we have about an hour transcribed it just that we can play with
so i can't imagine why anyone would care
as opposed to connected digits
we can go back to the other thing later i mean we
we did right and just the randomly generated and randomly assigned to dishes
i just say so we have this any forty hours of recordings now and
like you say i think a couple hours for a for a test that's to
that's to be to get you know more later because menus
is american speakers and we have
i speakers and we have these try to fight additional language groups overlapping certain aspects of the database
be i have never listened to not i did just as red in the studio i believe
is what they groupings everything you said there's like ten you know it's not
back up so we want very point i'd leave
for the most part we're keeping it standard we're level transcription that there's
those are the reasons for those reasons like i can't that's separate and
the call can be the qualities applied to the last they're actually had the status of
the call can be the qualities applied to the they're actually had the status of
to because i haven't been able to go at all the exceed things and until they've been right exactly
to because i haven't been able to go at all the right exactly
check led to refinement here which is
here which is to add numbs fifties or parts of the red number so you already know that

so i'm going to go first
that we headed out any of the errors anyway right so the
work at all because no one group them together so it just
when i look at this that first line is sixty one sixty two eighteen eighty six ten
if you go six dashed two nine three one
that's what i was asking grouping so if
how about over so zero people make mistakes we
it's and worrying about it i mean
i started to just numbers train data that we have our g. i. we've
that we have our g. i. we've done lots and lots of studies with that and
but it's to get it in this room with because i mean
it's to me it looks like you've got the phone the idea grouping you have great the idea of separation and
setting and little bit but the other differences are so major
i mean if i remember correctly it was like postman reading zip codes and things like that i it is it's what i
i have never listened to t. i. digits so red in the studio i believe
i purposely didn't want them to look like they're in any kind of pattern
so i'm like the previous one which i simply replicated t. i. digits this is generated randomly
was that was and someone said and someone said in the front in the middle
now it's at least six times we snow six now
yes this is exactly how people prove that these meetings do differ because we're recording right

right you guys since then you'll have just more digit date
just let them read it how they read it to some extent may we could just reading
just let them read it how they read it to some extent may we could just reading and have them read how they read it and just means we have
i just thought we're differ collette collecting digits an adamant said we were running out of t. i. forms i thought it would be to have them in groups and probably
and probably all else being equal would be better for me to just have single digits since
so i don't have specific need because if i did
i maybe it's completely stupid but we don't
stupid but we don't have any overlapping digit
i mean here let's try it you read the last going to try you know cross i can't
i mean here let's try it you read the last going to try you know cross i can't
think maybe if we wanted to do that we would do it as a separate sessions
i'm from i'm talking we're talking about transfer x. ways actually
because it we used x. ways to do the digits it's also true it just has his ex-wife
because it we used x. ways to do the digits it's also true it just has his ex-wife
i'm curious to see or hear it is but i didn't want to change it to something that stooges alignment
and that's not addressed to make there without punctuation extra forty one
where is that not addressed to make there extra forty one if it's questioned something
that's right i can't explain it
it's so funny of course now that

just let them read no i what i'm saying is that to some extent
is so different it's going to be very hard to be parable
does and i wouldn't take the inflated version so he talks
so he talks about the woman thing too powerful
but you know if it were to be deeply just a normal words it would be like a little story that we could read
but as the i mean i wanted to hear more about the transcription if we can get
if we can get channel a synchronized for the closer
i'm from i'm talking about transcriber actually you're talking to transfer
and so they'll have everything follies commission but not
follies commission but not it's really rather small set of these kinds of things and i
i didn't want to change it to something else until i knew maybe it's art
transcription mean just a single letter has in the particle no
they print sized is something that the transcriber thought was eight and but wasn't entirely so i
you have to make it that's good that's correct i mean because they have no idea right if you hear
correct right if you hear c. p. d. i mean they do pretty but its
i say it i think a lot of them are the networks making i think to know
now it's at least six times we snow six now
so how would that be a problem for doing the language there's actually a bunch of cases like this with people's names and
so how would that be a problem for doing the language modeling than with our transcripts here like this with people's names and yes

did crash so i feel much better earlier
i i it might help i would like to
that's what i was help i would like to get away from having only one specific grouping
that's what i was asking grouping so if that's your question
pretty different but i think the idea of using a set thing was just to give you some sort of framework so
were transcribers they're going to hate us just so we
i don't think we're going to collect vast amounts of data that way but i
i was actually going to skip the is our results part in favor of getting the transcription talked about since i think
so why do you want to do x. accomplished
files in and do all the naming automatically sneezing
and if not then i gets checked then there's
is this would be great so i'll be able to get through that tonight and then every
the first meeting
but i don't actually member what it was that

done which were done by non native speakers so the we have a core
so the we have a core that replicate c. original data set which
i think that trying to duplicate spending too much effort trying to duplicate the existing t. i. digits probably's into worthwhile because the recording
except that if you have the stimuli comparable then it said something about t. b. contribution of setting and no it's not the same little bit but the other
x. question mark
so for things like and the fact that someone doesn't say the d. that's not important enough to capture the transcription because it's
they have the gloss you have the gloss forms a script but we don't
you always replace it exactly
every place because of because don't know sissy and he's but he has a scripted
number of times out of the entire database except for that of incidences
and you know you'll have to think earnestly right see
to think earnestly right see so whoever's
me it it's in fact it was
point f. i. p. words so this is also spelled out and antlers

cognitive li it's much easier i also had
easier i also had a hard time with the words but then we went back
and as the spacing all right do you think there should be more space between digits in groups give that a try and
is that right i mean what do other people think is you
it so that it's possible with a script to plug in the fall or the graphic form for that one and
correspond to i don't even how to pronounce that now that's only occurs once and i'm thinking
exactly so it's actually probably good for us to know the difference between the real a. and the one that's just like or transcribed at cousins like
cousins like an switchboard you would see i all of these forms but they
out the spelling and else gets kicked out of me a prick frequency listing i right
mom's times right now which is just and numbs by itself which means
which means is for the numbers test i
however you want because it systematically and coated you know have to
that's i was asking right it would be spelled out in words point five

that i mean the the corpus itself we're collecting and the notation
and the fact that it's almost all in search and there is which you would expect
but you might also think that any overlap reasons you would get substitute shins and so forth
so these are you leads us to believe that doing a better segment patient like you're channel they segment patience or some kind of echo cancellation to get back down to the individual speaker i'd wrenches would be probably all that we would need to be able to do good recognition on the close talking mike so
they partition it but
i don't know what's typically here but
those are going to be cut down samples then that's it that's
it does hard part max argument
maybe tied little dictating so jane what's see i have one
maybe tied little dictating so see i have one question about that
which shouldn't be called t. i. c. k. l. e. or something like it's not they wasn't fifty c. of course
the first meeting

liz transfers ass from jane and disk space in storage
so we're what we're doing is we're writing out i mean is
out i mean is just a question
we're writing out these individual segments that wherever there's a and monday from t. lowered or change transcribers it you know we chop it there and the reason
point about the naming conventions is that you could you can get rid of it's
sows for example what if you wanted to run all be native speakers you know this is an hour of speech
no i'm not suggesting you little long life i'm for
the chris rock how about question mark it's the only place for weather used
i wonder what they checked yet c. t. s. is really big here
to me that sounds equivalent
need a lot of qualification adam i it's been changed

you have to be we actually figured out a way to the
better for me too because the digits are easier to recognize the
but that may be to have twenty hours of digits state that but
but the truth is i'm hoping that we to do the that you guys have been doing to continue that we get the best we can do on the spontaneous near field and then
so what is the difference between papers rustling in drafting papers i know that is
now it's at least six times since we snow six now
didn't don't normally you don't go around thing now you said it's expensive
and that's not addressed to make there of and that's just without the without punctuation extra forty one no i didn't
page two afternoons
i'm just pointing that out this it's the only

of separation and it's just a matter if the instructions so
and i think they're about ten different grouping patterns and that right liz that's right let's give it a try
once and for me it'll call was i
so it does a very fuzzy sort of match so at this
so at this point we can sort of finalized the naming and so forth and we're
on like losses on the different types of comments which so then it's fine
so the pronounce black fans get underscores these
and the non vocal and so i like

some of the early keep files it looks like we're done by hand
i mean the other thing is we could just bag it because it's
bag it because it's it's and
also we maybe can just let them choose zero versus so as they like because
so that was part of the spell checker that was after the
so you'll see how often these different things occur but
you can correct it since you know what that is you know we could correct it but

and we sort of decided that it's probably not an issue that we headed
six dash one you mean if you go six
but i mean it seems to me that at least for us we can learn to read the maths digits if that's what people
if that's what people want i don't
you i mean you want this do you need training day there adaptation is out of this how much
different context and that sort of interesting
but for the future research we're doing we differ microphone positions and so on we would like to no we always have the original

i don't know work as do they
but it's the same thing i'm out there everybody do where was it's that paper
but the very front page deals with this final pay aspect of standardization which has to do
so listed again same deal with exhaustive listing of everything found in everything except for these finals thirty minutes
so on some of these calls thirty minutes
i see right and that word in there in you know stays in language small wherever it was you never
i'm i didn't follow that lasting so glossy in the

so on them on the middle you know looking at so and so
on the middle to so in the first case that gloss applies to the word to the left but in the and so and this gets
while laughing one which is why laughing and
would really be a shame because i personally would not be able to make a claim that those are dramatically different items so right
it so smallest so right now i've standardized across all existing data with these spoken forms i should say
like their is on fire i haven't heard it actually i mean
so i need to go back or someone needs to go back and say you know yes or no and then get rid

and either correct them or have them re read so we probably
read so we probably have like four or five more forms to be read to be wants to this that i've also
that i've also extracted out about an hours worth we have about two hours
percival and have to go back and fix those so
and so the question is does anyone care i'm
and it actually it's no more and think people

right i mean all the frequently as long as you can regenerate
right i mean all the can be re generated catch the question and put it all the
right i mean all the can be re generated
catch the question and put it all on scratch because the
on scratch because we're sixty is model next bite back up
so if you did i grab minus the nuns and so you could do grab mine is being so

but i think it's more efficient if we have the search based of the small ones
and it's no problem right because it's
no problem right because it's not backed up it's
me you know it's not a big
a bottle neck is good too think toward scratch yes of these wouldn't be backed up
like accommodate with one down that

it is she's do you think two hours is the total that we have
but i mean morgan has this paper copy and if people have questions
and if people have questions
because of that reason that it's a little bit farther than the pronunciation variant
or no and then get rid of the print deceased but the

what about putting a hyphen between these but i probably not so much
not as connected numbers right and you can give an example like
right like you know six sixty one would be read as six one
i mean red versus naught such major sources of variance that it's
i mean red versus naught what's an example such major sources of variance that it's it's

we can go back to the other thing later
so with a one word better and some tenants or since you know you got huge aerate
the chris rock how about question mark it's the only place for weather used
making i think that's true
a lot of these are coming from them i listen

all we have for some people is digits i'm serious so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation
anything starting with access scratch
so on keep that for second because they're not ready for that
so on the fifth age seven that they're not ready for that exactly
attached and at that point i pick up things like you know a word fella by two commas and then

all we have for some people is digits i'm serious so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation and we're
and we're not using the did dictated now but you
right same foot see the thing is we have that in the same meeting and
right same acoustics a microphone and so
right same acoustics a microphone same channel and so you don't get

but how would you do that automatically so there's like
but how would you do that automatically like
the only problem is that with for the recognition we map it to be and so if we know
occurs once and i'm thinking of changing that's i
that like someone's like burning or something like their of changing that's i haven't listened to it so i don't know i haven't heard it

they always and so it's like they're paired curly brackets and then the third
and then the third type right now is things that fall in the category of comments about what's happening so it could be something
this might been talk about about how recognize your if it's looking for with three m.'s and it's transcribed was two am that it might have it might increase the error rate which is which
it's reconstructed have that happened and work with lost data
now the other day ample is in the gloss as right there five

probably added to the language model yam we probably should we should add it to the dictionary note to pronunciation
yam note to pronunciation model
language but
what wasn't both while lane added spoke dictionary language but like it's in a language motto but
what wasn't both while lane added spoke dictionary language like it's in a language

speaker for extracted one procedures you have speaker forms and
it just or to remove cross time talk about but right
i the only argument against that sampling is to just the original father kids want to experiment with different filtering techniques i'm and on the flies so if
techniques i'm i mean overall if

right so the there are no errors in the digits you always read
so in conversations with liz and jane we decide that if you wrote them out as numbers instead of words it would it listed more phone number or social security number like readings
going to hate us so we around like where you do two at a time and then the next
then that's it that's why we need more distance because we're duplicating

but maybe a little short if we actually want to do training in that station and all that other
what about putting a hyphen between the numbers in the group but i probably not so much
six dash one you mean right so if you have
it seems to work pretty too got rid of those so up and that's the sort of thing that you would do exactly so it's

out to that we already have we can go back to that's fine with me as long as it's just that i didn't want to the people who would have been collecting digits the other day to not have the digit
fellas there immediately
what this meant i'm still doing the overview haven't actually gotten
and i'm i got lost here what

different the individual human a lot of maybe different free trial you know it's just
it's just so different scripts until it's in right
and then going to check involves being that every other and hasn't done a viable speaker and if
then the not non local station would be something like a door slam

i may i think the readings it because if you think you know g. i.
sort of framework so that even though you couldn't do exact in paris and wouldn't be valid scientifically at least give you some kind of frame of reference
i'm working like some of yours and then
i know someone said i have done all this jumping up of digits

and which group of peers is pick randomly and what the numbers are picked randomly
i think it'll be graded to be able to compare digits whether it's these
on in actual script any actual transcript ice i so this happens
so this happens in the very first one

so you read the last line so but
then disregard it so i now have a script in there so
you can access it from anywhere e.
this is all just temporary access i don't

parallel it's the p. make of did you reading we take one around about it
it's the p. make of did you reading about it
of did you reading it's right about it
i mean i was sort of serious but i

around row your boat blair like
the alignments uncovered you can't load an hour speech into excise
you need to have these small files and in fact
because it's a good pronunciation you know model would be able to handle that however things like

and victor porsche had a piece on this where he inflated the digits i wonder
i wonder if there's and if they would be of value in having digits that are gases and better than real words to compare in terms of like there to kill nations of one and wonderful versus one is did you thing right
not after eight though
which you would expect but you might also

this german great for the germans to be german
yes but not i mean it's c. u. z. always meaning because
and someone pointed out to me
clarify but you can see the practices convention makes it very easy to find him because

and that's where the proms pumpkin and so i just is
they were the canadians right canadians we
the canadians right canadians
and that's just without the without punctuation i didn't

out here so three on the site
all right so first of all there was an interest and be transcribed transcription checking procedures and
and i can tell you first to go through the steps although you've probably seen
checks and the first thing i did was a spell check and

don't really so hard you know it's you just did right now i'm
except for now another there's another word there much that's right
except for now there's another word much
except for now another there's another word there much that's right

language but there's not very many of these tickles
of these are me that deep i said with a high tech high pitch and like thing that was that he sees he said get
that was that i was imitating peeping out perfect we
out perfect that's it that's been changed there is something spelled out p. e. in the

so you collecting and gender
so i did collecting agenda you collecting and gender
i did collecting agenda

i started about an hour's worth which are
hour's worth which are the digits would pour which is do speak or have speaker for have filled out speaker forms
have filled out speaker forms not everyone's filled out a

and so they're not automatically percival and have to go back
this german great for the germans to be german
and that's why there's this other tag here which occurs a hundred and five or ten and five times right now which is just

yes that you think will be able to retrieve the other or something
somewhere extracts out the language finds
maybe tied little dictating so that's partly and see i have one question about that the e. h. versus like that age and u. h.

so it's just a question of little hand editing of some files and then waiting for more
and then waiting for more people to turn in their speaker forms
speaker form and i sent an email to everyone who hadn't feel that speaker form and they're slowly

and they're slowly trickling in so
and i've scripts that will extracted and done
formats is that something we need to talk about the meeting or should use

the problem with that is it becomes numbers instead of digits when i look at
is out of this how much of this duty with
of this duty with

so we could just put easier to recognize the better trained than numbers
you know time wise and it
and versus aha

but regardless it's going to it's hard to compare cross corpus but it's different
corpus it's different people this is the core thing and
especially for speakers that don't talk a lot so

and number of digits in a group and
although coming from them i listen to some of that
we don't have that many acronym is comparatively and this meaning it's not so bad i see plenty of i agree

groups and each one has between two and four groupings and
it's in the paper so it's the same thing i'm out there he it's that paper
so it's that to that would be very interesting for us because we

doing and everybody's laughing
doing this it's no it's not stupid
this it's no it's not stupid it's just i'm just

it's going to require some coordination then it would go like twice as fast
it's going to require some coordination then it would go like twice as fast or if they're just
and we were going to ask him if they're you know what's out there in terms of like inflation and things like that not that we were going to do it

attached to just but there are other words that contain the same general phone phoning sequences like wonderful
like wonderful has one and it and
it and also i just want to mention briefly that and various and i all that ghana alice is still stuck in switzerland and we were

i think the question is what the research is
is what the research is i mean i presume that the reason they you wanted to have these it just this way because you want to actually do some research looking at presiding form here
so if somebody wanted to do that if they want to look at the difference of the phones and the digits in the context of word versus ditches non did you work versus and did you word that would be a good thing to do but i think someone

so the it would look for premature
so but i thought we were just going to move the boundaries and that's the hand seeker
got rid of those so up and that's the sort of thing that you would do

but that's the hand so there's
right i mean i'm but we can downtown so
those are going to be cut i mean i'm as long as there's a reform that we can come from again that is not down samples then so that's it that's why we need more distance

do sort of what he's already what he's trying to do of individual state right
i and then we'll move on
i think this also ties into one of the things that jane is going to talk about too we'll move on

compiled a list of speaker names that's it for that speakers in
you've compiled a list of great so that's it for that
i just got this new eighteen gig drive installed

i see right slash and slash machine name slash x. a. in all likelihood had around
we get the same performance
i the only i mean the front and on after i can they're just down samples and on the flies so

right a big deal because discs don't crash very frequently as long
so the sri friend and microphone positions and so on we would like to no we always have the original long ones
i have frequencies so you'll see how

right i mean because it's not backed up and it's just on scratch occurs tools can't take shorten format i would leave them expanded so you don't have to
and then in addition to that i didn't exhaustive listing of the forms in the data file which included
like it's not on in actual

so you don't have to on shorten them every single time you want to do anything
weekend down ensemble
all right so spelling check first then an exhaustive

and that's the whole orders you can actually move them around
native speaker and all the man and all the women can grab everything with the word and it's
nuns and you get rid of anything that was read so that's so there wouldn't

you little long life i'm just saying you give it started in time and
yes but not the reverse so sometimes
but it's the same items very interesting

seemed really fast and also to check
but did you notice that there were seven hundred and eighty five instances of and no
was that somewhere where i'm not exactly about that

them as you might imagine when you're dealing with really a fair number of words and natural speech which means
which means suffer pairs and all these other factors that there are lots of things to be standardized and streamlined and checked on and
i did a bunch of checks and

i'm data file which included detecting things like faulty punctuation things
and they do their passover it and yes
the actually will go through this in order so

yes and that's why they're different tags on like losses
on the different types of comments which so then it's fine
so are we done with acronym

we'll expand that but they but the comments or four types mainly right now one
mainly right now one of them is the gloss type we just mentioned
so are another type is

and then you have it's there's a couple different types of elements that can happen that aren't really properly words
but just needs to be double check now we just comments
but just needs to be double check now we just comments

laughing and that is it big an argument could be made for this turn turning that into a qualitative statement because it's talking
because it's talking about the thing that preceded it but
it but at present we haven't been coding of the exact scope of laughing you know and so

she go offline we're not doing or not doing links he'll do it filled paused for it
doing or not doing links he'll do it filled paused for it
but you're native german speakers so it's not

so it's not not a issue for only
only if you don't have lacks balls i right so
makes sense i think he's i right so it's like japanese and spanish

we don't have that many acronym is comparatively i see plenty of
and this meaning it's not so bad i agree
amber buses has a fair amount but the n. s. a. right

spoke dictionary language but it's in a language motto but
but take always motto but so it's the presentation model that has to have a pronunciation of cole
a lot of these are me that he sees

but there are places where they
that's i was asking point five
point only it's spelling words so

still labeling the relevance of the speaker form here
still labeling the extracted audio files

the digits you always read the string correctly
the spaces already biased toward being separated it's just easier to read

care i'm a very spoken with liz and she feels that correct me if i'm wrong that for connected numbers is fine as opposed to connected
coated you know have to think about what's the best for is for the overall purposes but in any case

i think two hours is probably fine for cats that
and i'm that they're doing more specific i mean if i remember correctly

single digits since it's you know i recognize is going to do better on anyway
and it's more predictable so we can know from

as they like because even the same person sometimes says and sometimes so zero in different context and that
it would just be very that's really the next step

and it actually it's no more official than what we've been doing with words i'm and think people
we're collecting it in a red digit you know take care of list and i'm that they're

doing with words i'm people can adapt to this are single right
i thought so whether it's it is it's what i thought it was red

are single the spaces already biased toward right it's just easier to read
i know i'm going to find it's easier than words

i think that it's fine it's to me reading them
and i think they're about ten different grouping patterns that's right let's give it a try

the racial and something like twenty to one certain snakes
to one certain snakes makes sense so if we

you said there's like ten different groupings
right just groupings in terms of number of groups in a line

i'd the patterns like are they in a group and the pattern of grouping
we have a problem with that

strings are out there and they're usually grouped into either two three or four digits at a time and they can have
i mean actually things are getting longer and longer

because you might be wearing a different microphone and i mean
and i mean it's it's to have the digits you know replicated many times

that'd be interesting to see whether that helps so those speakers who are very quiet shy
that'd be interesting to see whether that helps speakers who are very quiet shy

at some point when we feel it's but surely understand what's going on with it then we have to move on to the spontaneous dating with the fire field
don't have i know this sounds weird i maybe it's completely

it's just try to do it i'm just talking for the that like dan ellis is
it's just try to do it i mean i'm just talking for the that like dan ellis is going to try you

it you read the last line already the first line
like it's not the speaking style that differs it's the fact

years you could do but then you don't get the same effect what
what i mean is actually not the overlaps that are govern linguistically but the actual

the acoustic that like dan alison and company want to do
just are and behaved i mean

you do the last of serious but i really i mean i don't feel strongly enough that it's a good idea
you do the last line i'll do the first one that it's a good idea

i can understand a single thing guys the same i think it was numbers but and that probably was great finally
than doing seeks

people i mean i think it was doable i'm
i had some general questions or should use talk with chuck at some other time

but it's nine working
that's in the sound dated so i got a check

this german great for the germans scream screaming mean to be german and german
i'm curious to see or hear it is but didn't know we just we waiting on that stooges alignment

know that would be useful for comparison but it's embedded
for comparison but it's embedded numbers

every note it's
we have is our results from liz transfers

fancy but i think and just having the results there and pointing
there and pointing out main conclusions like it's

was that was speakers in it someone said the front in the middle
i. d.'s names and names to i. d.'s so

i noticed so chock little pal three out of four times
so they didn't mean pickle as in elmo payment

right how you where were i would for you it was or who was next to
where you were sitting probably affected where were i would was or who was next to me or something like that

and it's picking up all the morgan words pretty
names but i. d.'s names and names to

so the idea is that you would take this big hunk where somebody is only speaking a small amount in it and then
just use it recording and

so i thought we were just speaker who's the background seeker
that's partly and non native thing but i have found e. h.

but that's the hand so there's
i've actually done some experiment sloth across correlation it seems to there's

fillets do that all flying and you do it during right
flying and you do it during right definitely

and it does all sorts of matches because
sorts of matches because the way people feel about names is different on every single file so it does a very

and so forth and we're going to read rewrite out these way forms that we did because as you notice
did because as you notice in the paper your animal foreign one meaning in m. and another meeting

i had some general questions just about the compression algorithms of shortening wave forms and i don't know at some other time
forms and i don't know exactly who to ask i thought

it just i'm and i didn't have a scratch scratching half of it is
i'm not exactly how they partition it probably

how do you do that eighteen that because is making gate drivers is thirty six gig drive was eighteen a eighteen it was just
slash and eighteen it was just there that they've had around

right then it's fine but for the future because we're duplicating their originals
so what it was that was eric did that

audio file they actually have to be chopped out already
i agree i would like to standardize he's down farther but

and that's the whole point about the naming conventions is that you could them around you can get rid of it's
no i'm not suggesting if you try to loads really long way from into x-rays you'll be waiting there for

out the language finds the time marks for that particular one do it that
funny kept gaining p. t. a. for p. d. a. this is close

this embedded in the file name
so there were vietnam's task and it's not going to be included in the red digits anyway so in india

access i don't i think it's all just it's fine
we're going to never recognized this meeting money python you say are a lot so

you can get ways to start in the meantime
and then you go awesome in the dictionary gets cousin one and that

until it's six it on some right it takes a
six it on some but not the way solidly it takes a very long time

seemed really fast and also to check the file so
regardless the file so if you have a transcript

i think overall you could get everything to work by accessing the same way and trying to find too you know the beginning and times
all of these forms but they all were like

too think toward scratch yes of these wouldn't be backed up
this number of times out of the entire database the number to the left is the number of incidences

my me afterward and all and we'll look at your desk and see where to put
a stress marker here sometimes the contrast stresses showing up and i'm

maybe she would do a do you want to write and just see which publishes
and just see which publishes on each

check and at that point i discovered certain things like
so it's maybe that they got to the point where me was low enough understandable

and you begin these sandies quality checks right exactly i do these checks exactly
and so do it as an exhaustive listing of the actually will go

that one and a couple of others not many
so one is another one going

one going that go a is another one with just
one with just the assumption again that this the easy things which is not really fair that consider expected of pronunciation mall to handle and checking

and checking that you indicated that causes is one of those it's handled in a different way also did she did i
so i might have been my husband you but someone

and with all these things being in curly brackets there was just
thinking i also wrote a script which will retrieve anything in curly brackets or anything which i've classifies an acronym

and so your list here are these ones that actually occurred in the meetings and it's yes
we are acronym so now and

we are acronym loaded and test the question about glossing before god so
god so for a word like because is it that it's always predictably because

the reverse so sometimes people will say because in the meeting and if
in the meeting and if they actually said because then it's written is because with no doesn't even

but that's funny done has and so if we know that's easy
but they have the gloss that's funny done has a script that's easy but

every place because of because if it's cost but he has a scripted right but if it's
but then there are other glasses that we don't replace right because

these things in curly brackets are viewed as comments or comments four
or comments four types is good to introduce

types is good to introduce that four times
disturbing right see so whoever's creating the new models will have to also go through the transfers and change them thinking it's like right

and what some of them are laughing breeze so we have
breeze so we have that's pretended with of tag a v. o. c. and the non vocal

or something else and the comet so you this would let's just take
yes it's very bad sell preferential aspect of this this is exactly

but in the middle to and this gets up to here
that's not applying anything right they're impulsive

because was a prude or film was in a place i didn't expect
it's we she reconstructed have that happened and work with lost data

and i made it so that these are with a couple exceptions but things that you wouldn't find in the spell checker so that they'll show
checker so that they'll show up really easily and

teaching cashew question what's that very last one correspond to i don't even how
correspond to i don't even how to pronounce that now that's only

hear it because i only heard it no we just gave her a list of words that you know weren't in our dictionary and so of course it
and so of course it picked up like this and she just didn't

but i have found e. h. in native speakers too
that's and versus aha but it's mostly non native

transcription has in the particle no
transcription particle so your age no i mean like the u. h. or

i know she go offline i'm just the sport transfers are going to hate this meeting we're not
know she go offline are going to hate this meeting we're not

systematically maybe with some of them they end up being is but i
but i my spot checking has made me think that we do have a. and also american dated represented here but

and just and you get and did everybody's
then the akron and she and the ones in parentheses

those question marcus punctuation so it they
that's pretty close this is close right in the p. t. a.

i know i don't recognize a lot of this i you know how are they going
i know i say it i think i don't recognize a lot of this i you know how are they going to know

but the n. s. a. group is just very many
the recognize there's funny kept gaining

stability that they weren't entirely that person said you
said you know so i don't really necessarily a and for black man but just needs to

of disturbing have to look at it that's i look for that one i actually
that one i actually explicitly look for that one and i think that

that's this legitimate so no comments
so no comments you can see they're listed again same deal

right you never would put tickle in the language model in that form
would put tickle in the language model in that

many of these tickles one of them
there's a number tag i'm i didn't

that's been changed in the thank you
you need a lot of you what i'm it was the he was saying how many you have to allow

and easy enough to find them when they're curly brackets we can always going to gossip
we can always going to gossip listing of these things and find them and change them sings finale

on the gloss is for numbers
it seems like there are lots of different ways it's being done there's interesting question yes

so you already know that i had places where they had transcribe numbers put numbers in place of any kind of numbers but there are places where they
point f. i. p. words so this is also spelled out and antlers

so what's the last disease off to the side you can't have the seven and
so what's the last disease have the seven and

what's the left of that no and
of that and that case it's people saying things like one and so or

and we already got the crash out-of-the-way did crash so

so we're pretty much out of digits we've gone

we have about two hours worth

not everyone's filled out a speaker for extracted

and for meetings in which the key file and transfer files reversible

was i didn't quite catch all these different things that are not quite right that you think will be able to

i have this web based speaker form and i

by speaker id and microphone type wasn't like whether they were giving us permission to use their digits

speaker id and microphone type no i spoke wasn't like whether they were giving us permission to use their digits or something

no i spoke with jane about that and we sort of decided that or something

so the other topic was digits is

and it just didn't work at all because

like so if you always had the same grouping you wouldn't like that is that

it's a little bit better for me too because

worrying about it i mean because we do have digits training data that we have from from gee i started to just

but if they make mistakes it's no big deal if people

need because if i did i'd probably try to collect it you know without bothering this group but

so i can just add to the instructions treated as digits not as connected we can try it right and

but then we went back and forth and so let's

and as the spacing all right and forth and so let's give that a try and

right i people think is you reading them

and i think they're about ten so that's right let's give it a try

now and you're saying two hours is digits so that's for

digits so that's for the racial and something

some sense but

for that because it seems to me that there's a real strength and having the same test replicating a whole bunch of times and adding to

bunch of times and adding to that basic test bank

because then you have no more and more chances to get away from random errors and

i think the other thing too is that right now we have service try to fight sample with reference to dialect groups and it might

and it might be there might be an argument to be made for having a for replicating all of the digits that we've done which were done

because the recording situation is so different it's

and not just trial you know it's just there's so many things it's and

i don't really know how it compares

the core thing and they're different circumstances a different recording environment so forth so

so forth so it's it's really pretty different but i think

i'd the patterns like are they based on anything grouping

if you look at it there between like three and five groups and each one

digits whether it's these digits or t. i. digits to speakers and compare that to their spontaneous speech and then we do need

and then we do need you know a fair amount of did you did because you might be

like adam do you think that would help adapting on right

a real problem with that actually i mean it's the same microphone foot see the thing

and then we do a lot of the testing of the algorithms on the digits for the far field at some point

we talked about that a couple times and i know it's weird

i we could try to try doing anyway it's just a thought

i we could try to try doing anyway it's just a thought

to try doing some it's just a thought it would

i'm not it just sort of sound like a duet or

or theater art i just write three once you could pick one in the middle

people were transcribers they're i think it was doable i'm just

rice like around like and at a time and then the next person picks up on the first i've done or something like

just wise around row your boat what do you call it blair like

your boat like that

thought i'm actually sort of serious if that would help people do that kind of but the people

i don't think we're going to collect do that kind of but the people who want to work on it we should talk to them

something like that rather than do it during real meeting and you know

real meeting and you know do two people at a time then three people at a time

then three people at a time and things like that

see what dan if we have nothing we have no agenda

see what dan right if we have nothing we have no agenda we could do it i'm like

right some the whole time it i'm like

i thought this was going to be so have haven't another going to question some the whole time reading digits it's a different kind of comedy

i thought this was going to be so have haven't another going to question a different kind of comedy

i thought this was going to be so have haven't another going to question about this so a different kind of comedy

these did you get attached to just but there

this german great for the germans to be german

it was good when you scream at the like

like everybody's little punch here today

i mean i just went off as possible task because you know today

because you know if we were to eat read this embedded numbers words and sand senses because

thing to do but i think someone would have to express interest in that

i mean if you were interested in like to do it christians

and disk space in storage formats from dawn is do

is do we have any prayer preference on which we want to go

about since i think that's more important to moving forward but i mean morgan

it's pretty preliminary in terms of this our results because we didn't

because we didn't do anything fancy but i

it's the fact that there's overlap that causes recognition errors

so these are you if you have a hard copy what're you email it the list on the close talking mike so that's about the summary

but this is morgan has this paper i mean

it's in the paper so it's the same thing i'm out there he it's that paper

it's in the paper so it's the same thing it's he it's

so it's that's why i only used apart from these that you had about because we right

so if there was a case segment or mix channel or x. p.

so if there was a case segment of speech this long x. p.

was that was speakers in it and someone said the whole thing was passed to the recognize it that's why there's so and someone said in the front in the middle that's right in fact i

it that's why there's so many in searching that's right in fact i pulled out a couple classic examples in case you want to use them in your talk of

it that's why there's so many in searching that's right in fact i pulled out

early on i noticed the check was wearing a lapel a lot times

early on the check was wearing a lapel a lot

early on the check was wearing a lapel a lot

and i were little pole once and for me

where you were sitting probably affected that me or something like that right

that right but when chuck were little tell ann morgan was talking there a couple really long outer and says where chuck

outer and says where chuck is saying a few things inside and it's picking

pumpkin and so i just is sort of what we expected but it's to be able to

but it's to be able to show it and also

and he said flown flew what would need to be done and

and he's going to look into trying to run some things that are out there and

time but right and that would be similar to what you're also trying to do but using

but using you know more than energy i

for so it would be i don't know what exactly would go into it so it the idea is

to do sort of what he's already what he's trying and get the locations which gives you also the time boundaries of individual state

not a great to do i see i right it's said that there are many techniques for the kinds of cues that you can use to do that

not a great i see it's said that there are many techniques

see they've is also going to be it primarily echo cancellation further your field far afield so

and i past this

because we can't do too much you know and terms in terms of wrecking assures olds knowing that this is a big problem

until we can do that kind of processing

i'm working like and so once we have some of yours and then

so i have some naming conventions that we should try to agree on fillets do that all right

and i've scripts that will extracted out from key files in and done

you've automatically sneezing instantly great so

then disregard so that's why those comments person in there so

then disregard it so i now have a script that you could just say look up morgan and it will give you in there so right

morgan and it will give you a psyche

who to ask i thought maybe you would be the person to talk to so

talk to so the losses compression when you compress so

so i mean i my question would be is i just got this new eighteen

it just depends on your tools

and the reason is that we conceded to recognize or and

this and those are the ones that were storing

this it's that's it's regenerate a bull what i would do is take down sample it so

and compress it however your the answer i recognize or wants to take it in so we can't shortening

those are going to be cut down samples then that's it that's

to do that but it's actually convenient hasn't chopped out because you can run

chopped out because you can run them you know in different orders you

is that you could run all the english speaking all the native it's a lot faster

is that you could run all the english speaking it's a lot faster

all the native speakers and all the non right you

speakers and all the non native speaker and all the right you can grab everything with

and it's a lot quicker than actually trying to access the wave file each time find that time

what if you wanted to run all know this is an hour of speech

right so if you did that way you have to generate a program that looks in a database somewhere extracts

say you just say you know asterisk that's so that's part of it is

you say you just say you know asterisk e. asterisk thought waving you get way too hot that's so that's part of it is right

rather than doing seeks and the other part is that once they're written it is a lot faster too to process

want to do however is convenient

and he just has a big files of houses in memory

and they don't two getting you can do extremely fast is but the other thing is that believe it or not i mean we have some so we're also look

so we're also look at these in ways like for the alignments uncovered you

you can get small files and in fact even for the transcriber program

in time and it'll just go and pull out that section the transcribers

section the transcribers didn't have any problem with that today jane

know with the transcriber chosen they live in they live that what's what respect loading the long

know with the transcriber chosen they live in they live that what respect loading the long

know with the transcriber chosen no problem in they live that long

know with the transcriber chosen no problem they live in they live that long files into x. ways what respect loading the long it takes a very long time

files into x. ways it takes a very long time

i'm from i'm talking about transcriber actually you're talking to transfer transcriber right

seemed really fast and it's a lot slower to load in a long file and also

regardless it's i mean it's

if we don't have a spirited sitting around we go out and we by ourselves in eighty gigabyte drive and make it all scratched

and make it all scratched me you know it's

at your desk and see where to put

you want to use either x. a. or scratch x.

jesus read x. with too two digits

jane so i got print out here so three on the site

although you've probably seen them as

so you're doing these so the whole process is that the transcribers get the conversation and they please

then when they're finished it that it comes to you and you begin these that's right

seven that exactly

first then an exhaustive listing of the all the forms the day that with the punctuation attached and at

then there's this issue of gloss things so called spoken form so they're most

what and that's done would do some shown that pronunciation parents can be handled so for things like

however things like where you're lacking entire very prone it for so little and

little and for the more it's a form that specific just spoken language those are the reasons

that's separate and use the convention abusing c. u. z. for that form

however glossing it so that it's possible

the so when i get the exhaust so the spell check

so the spell check picks up those words because they're not

words because they're not in the dictionary gets

brunch out i said you know so like decide script saying whenever you see going to converted to going to you know glossy equals quote going to quote

and pronounced acronym

and the way tech act pronounced acronym is that i have underscores between they compliment so if it's

so if it's a. c. l. and it's a underscore see underscore l.

we are acronym loaded and test the question about

doesn't even figure into the equation

but our meetings people don't say hey because id on because right

if it's cost right but if it's

types of comments which will see and just a second

and maybe we'll expand that but

we done with acronym a question on what this meant i'm still doing

i'm the overview haven't actually gotten here yet

so losses things like replacing the full form with the more reviewed once the left and then you have

and the non vocal and so i like door slams and typing and that's prepared with

so then it just the ending hurley brace theirs and that's prepared with not non vocal station

so then it just the ending hurley brace theirs not non vocal station

hurley brace theirs or something else and

the comet let's just take one example

so it could be something like you know referring to so-and-so talking about

talking about such and such

but in the middle to that's not applying anything right they're impulsive and this gets up to here no they're events

right i just meant the middle two one two

and actually it is true that with respect to laugh there's another one which

while laughing is why laughing and

you know and so to have laughing you know that it happened somewhere in there which

in there which could mean that it occurred separately and following or you know

or you know including some of the better insists the last

haven't been awfully precise about that but i have here

which has to do with spoken forms like and and all these different types

rate which is which would really be a shame because

it so smallest i should say all existing

all existing data except thirty minutes which got found today so

that's in the sound dated i got a check

it's much easier have that happened

that like someone's of changing that's i haven't listened to it so

like their is on fire i haven't heard it actually i mean

@reject@ is on fire seven actually i mean i need to listen to that one actually we gave this char

@reject@ seven we gave this char pronunciation person

and she just didn't listen so she

we're going to never recognized chi-ching we're going to have a big problem when we talk about the money

we're going to never recognized this meeting money python you say are

but you h. e. age we're all the same and then we

like that have been it has been transcribed the age

and sometimes it's stronger like day that's right

like day which is like closer to th and

and so you know i mean they i have there are some americans who are using this eight too and i haven't listened to it

ago and it's just hilarious to listen to do a search for the

and just listen to me and did everybody's doing it just

morgan can make a song out of it's really fun to listen to all these different

morgan can make a song out of it fun to listen to all these different

of it all these different vocal tracks you know but it's the same

i see she and the ones in parentheses are ones which the transcriber wasn't of and i haven't been able

i see of and i haven't been able to listen to clarify but you can

the chris rock how about question mark easy to find him because it's the only place for weather used

so it they said that

so they so it's appeal to me d. c.

they print sized i got lost here what's the difference can apprentice size acronym in the non parenthesis

you have to make it of the print deceased but the prince caesar used only in that context and transcripts of notice noticing that there's something on certain i mean because they

not that's pretty close right in the p. t. a. was in these topics about children anyway

is the p. t. a. working

sometimes let me see probably easier actually okay's so it's

i wonder what they big here

have to listen i agree i would

i'm we said accent no more than five times

yes it's very bad aspect of this

was that somewhere where they were going to say new speaker or something about that no i look for that

out this it's the only pattern that has a slash after it and i think

so i just i was just looking at the bottom of page a slash after it and i think it's so that's a phenomenon

so i just i was just looking at the bottom of page three there's that it's so that's a phenomenon

three there's that to be or not to be

there's no told in front of it excuse that's funny

try to stay on topic out there is one

the reason is because it was said tickle

i actually really just tickle

this comment about what they said common comment

it's not something you want to replace or contextual comments

what they said it's not something you want to replace common comment or contextual comments

elmo payment pickle isn't

probably added but it some way and we probably should we

probably added to the language model yam we probably should we should add it to the dictionary note to pronunciation

i see what i meant is that there should be a pronunciation tickle for t. c. l. as a word and that word

yes is there's a few cases like that where the word needs to be spelled out in a consistent way as it would appear in the language but there's not very

right we have this there is this thing i was going to talk to at some point about you know what do we do with the dictionary as rep updating the dictionary these changes have

these changes have to be consistent with what's in the like spelling people's names and so forth if

if we make a spelling correction to their name like

you need a lot of you what i'm it was the he was saying how many you have to allow

subtext so anyway so exactly that's for the like sending comment can't came in k. right

they're vocalists nation

losses and those of course get picked up on the frequency check because you see right

losses and those of course get picked up on the frequency

b. been you know make it kicked out the spelling and else gets right

know i don't know i think they don't have any implications for anything else it's like i'm tempted

it's like i'm tempted to leave them for now and

the sings finale types on

now first of all very important

it did this convention came later and it the very

and it the very first digit asking some transcripts actually transcribed numbers and

check point out that this is read speech and it's to have

and it's to have the option of ignoring it for certain other pop up things and that's why there's this

now that then i have these numbers that have quotation marks around him

i didn't want to put them as gloss comments because

comments because then you could substitute shannon actually

shannon actually the reason i did this was because i usually start out with the other persian you have the numbers and you have

numbers are saying see six seven seventy eight point two or whatever and

whatever and there's no way of capturing that if you're putting the numbers off to the side you can't

the left is in so example the

now i'm so it's not going to be mistaken as a gloss

now the it comes out as numbs quote dot five

lost one on one that's one three zero what's the left no

and so or they're saying two i mean zero whatever and in that

and in that case is part of the numbers task and it's

so there were vietnam's tag on those lines so in india there is

follow that lasting so glossy in the same line it would have gloss quote one day one thirty you have a gloss at the end of the line saying curly bracket numbs curly brackets

nuns and you get rid of anything that was read so that's so there wouldn't

read so there wouldn't be something like if somebody
