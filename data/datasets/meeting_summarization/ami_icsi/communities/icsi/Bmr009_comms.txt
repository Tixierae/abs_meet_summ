you know read and i mean take some
but in seventy she's got that he's got some pictures
who are is proposing and maybe it's you know it's harder to see with a like energy
and also these different organizations just a particular choice normalization make it better but
if that's the case that when two people over lefty quite there you know there's a conservation of energy and everybody these people talk
and within those types
i would actually still recommend that he do the overall thing so it might be something that we can help by categorizing some of them and then
you know so it's mostly that if we had to label it ourselves we would or we'd have to get started but if
she's like we also it's with reference to print purpose too that we want to have them coated you know it's always an interesting question that'd be great this is this
she's like we also it's with reference out and you know it's always an interesting question i think this is this
the digits that don't fill these out know it's
don't fill these out
instructions but if i'm not at the meeting either that or maybe you could maybe breakdown when people start did digits on that's especially
but that is the reason name e. mail in time are where they are and then or wrestling
they are and then the others are later on
the c. p. a number
something like kick characterize your accent and characterize your accent if you can't

simple so if you generated something like that just for the energy and see and then as the says to make have a smaller more coherent groups to look at that would be another interesting thing later
across i mean that's something we don't
you were also talking about possible to try both ways
this is true or last week but anyway
later maybe not this now
to talk about our options as far as transcription
if i. b. m. doesn't good but but we have to truths
good but will do that we have to truths
that right that's good later are we supposed to keep recording
forms
so it wasn't intentional it's an interesting observation but it wasn't tension how did how do you see another time if they didn't know the date
it's an interesting observation but it wasn't how do you
wages that come in at the point of dayton seat
i mean what if we put in both ways of asking them so one
them so one is region in another one is
they might it's really one of the questions but

and he's going to vary that number and also look at moving windows as we discussed before
but it wasn't tension how do you see another time if
because the date is when you actually read the digits in the time and excuse me the time
assumed so the time is supposed to be pretty sex i just been taking
all right bye i mean to do really discussions you really want to start
that's because the one the digit form that has native languages is the old off the new form thank you thank
midlands north
this is the problem with these categories like
with these categories like i think those categories from tim it
so i my only question was if you were south midland speaking region person would you know it is that what you would eighty five
could ask where they're from but we you
we of read but we went back you said this thing
i mean so i would that's asking if they're from us anything i'm not

it doesn't impair question it seems like because it because
question it seems like because it because again if you're just compensating for the game and the fact
or last week but anyway
last week but anyway we took some core things that'd be
i mean with i we could do a very bad one with broadcast news right so whatever you would label would be touched the words
i mean with i we could do a very so whatever you would label
to the close mike we could come up tickets which were system or something
to be worth a try it'd be interesting to see what we get just you know put
someone from boston what this really strong right which probably means you have a very
and then maybe this north midland we call it north midwest south
midwest south midwest
the midwest one word submitted midland
the midwest one word submitted midland texas midland kansas i forget

but all the other cases my and the back
marks i was thinking that would come from the engineering side i don't think you need to i that i can give you my show
that would come from the engineering i don't think you need to show
is just a suggestion for what's new forms would look like
so they incorporate the changes that we talked about
why did you switch the order of the date and time fields
on which one time fields uncomfortable level touched on
it's i mean i you can sort of identify it's
really maybe i should put a little map and say put in extra room so
south midwest does that make sense that would
south midwest does that make sense
unless you're from it in kansas but help me because midland i

typically in the are starting around forty for most people it starts
the question is if it's a reasonable feature at all there's some separate
and it may not be the same for all the types of overlaps or the windows may not be
for all the others and that's in addition of the native language which is a bit redundant this one has native language
probably western i mean happy for them which spun spendings day
i mean you could call day differ you know is sent to spain that
usage we can give them little like a little map
i wouldn't know how to characterize mine either and
a techno speak the exit a geek region speak accent i think you know
it's not enough
so should we go back to we can make a list a little smaller

and someone who is who would be so the normalization
this was quite quick and would be so the normalization factor probably is
it but we were that in addition to that there should be related to pitching rocks and so forth
but and so mean what i meant is even if you use lanier raw measures like raw energy or whatever
use the distribution too my
he's got some pictures but he doesn't
but he doesn't in that he could just in the derivatives
they mean that they'll be time to be overlap between distribution is the question is
you have to study everybody individually but it's a simple case and the one that has a lot of data associated a study this simple it's to get rid of like that but the
then maybe you can try some different things to those three case it just seems like come
they might be the case so that the significant energy just as so they was saying comes in the non back channel cases

it's very inefficient is if you're interested in anything it before
you mean on the digit form because the user filled out the first three fields this is this rather low level question but you see came first
what which for you talking about this
this is the problem south midlands north
i'm thinking you but if you move five times in you're
i'm thinking you could have met multiple once and then amount of time so you're categorized that's the same
german accent i don't think so i see i'm thinking where
i because you know then you have some kind of subjective amount of time factored into it
i i could try it puts squeezing a little map i mean there's into it
that's exactly we're arguing about we don't know it's i for

spread at least involved in signal processing so maybe we can
no i just he didn't try to find speech
actually i was wondering right now all over the speech from the whole meeting and you're trying to find points of overlap but we don't really know which
because they're not really predicting the back channel
and sometimes it's an odd and sometimes it's any
you could imagine doing specialized ones for different types of back channels if you could if you had a good model for it
won't even the portion of the back you know won't want but you so you shouldn't be more than do you then they because it already it's more windows you know not they the little up and so
not bad because it takes less time and three q. there's no that's like
about payment and those are right from tenet right and so these

yes of some sort of if we can figure out a way to do it
actually do have some distribution sheer for these cases you has since
you sell the defense payments it would comment
he could just in the derivatives but not in the but he right so we
but he doesn't but he didn't have it for the energy had for furniture right so we don't know what they look like on the
i mean they just got to protest on buying and said and they to culmination
right i mean the reason i said that scattered features is i used to do this a lot when we had thirteen or fifteen or twenty features to look at
types consider that this was a generous believable
so it might be something that we can help by categorizing some this was a generous believable visual dropping

but again just looking at
we're not anytime side i that should be linked to the words which are to time somehow
we're not anytime soon going to get a forced alignment so
it's not hand mark then we're not going to get the times it's something that
it's not hand mark then we're not going to it's something that
we wouldn't be able to do any work without a force simon anyway so somehow
i could put this would be a radical suggestion but
and keeping other

i can just approach needed someone to do that i don't think there's really enough data where
i can just approach happy to use only they d. r. transcribe meetings where i seem to have another friend that was
meetings i seem to have another friend that was we come closer these days they donation
our dialects or whatever you region are the same but i don't know what it is
so a techno speak the exit you have a like techno speak accent i think
speak the exit a geek region i think you know
a geek region you know it's
that's but that's also north midlands right and that's north men but

did you form the did you form doesn't the did i wasn't they just did
doesn't the did you know that's right the digit form doesn't have a four
to i was comparing said that this is so i was looking at the change for so it's like we started with
just as i have for all the others and that's in addition
think midlands the one that's difficult i
scandinavian the minnesota areas north
areas north that's but that's north
they're hardly any really not if you people and i

the if i can you know my speaking for you for that right now
i mean another way would just be to take the speech from jesse morgan unjust jean and then just there overlap
overlap but by hand
that was a great overlap but and i don't think this is true
you to do that but i was thinking if done and i are trying to get categories and we labels
that'd be really great and we still have some funding for this project like probably if
on the new one time comes first mandate but i thought

yes right so what i was suggesting to him is that actually p. d. s. normally so just some kind of simple
he something like that weren't sort of dated
a good did you have this sort of thing for just the right that be on normalized no i haven't this is
so one is that one time only speaker for many others the digits that i see the thing i don't know it's
i don't know if i think this discussion has made me think that it's something to consider
i mean i had a wide open last week and he said ten it say cincinnati and summer so what if we put involved
that's what the other is four and but people no

you're detector if you're i
you're detector if you're i the place if you're doing essentially linear separation taking log first does in fact make it harder to separate
so it's so if you the so if they're close things it does so non linear
part wanted to include something that's not an overlapping but
things i mean one is your analysis window and then the other is any sort of normalization that you're doing i was talking about
that you're doing and they could be quite i was talking about the normalization
and they could be quite different right the normalization

that should be most interested in that
he but i think something like that weren't sort of dated
i think this is very good point that in fact it would be much more graphic just to show
except that it's hard to judge this because they're not normalized it's
just number of frames
i turn i mean i like it probably does happen sometimes the case where you would never know that unless you actually go in like

but what she's saying is which is right is what in a strange thing called of energy
but what she's saying is which is right is what i mean let's start with that before in a strange thing called of energy today
that's not what i meant then would you it's just too i suppose it's too close either they the energy kind of let me to be
by definition i'm for some for me
by definition i'm for some for me
probably western i mean happy for them which spun

up to frame level still frame level of what and then
sample ten minutes randomly right so then
right is that you would just take a look at the distribution of those two things much as you
much as you plotted in here
able to do it that there might be something helpful and cleaner about looking at just individuals and plus i think

i think you should at least be able doing
he's getting his feet wet and then he'll be starting again in mid january he's interested in
he's interested in trying to distinguish the types of
it sort of honing in on these different types of course now i don't consider that
get started but if it would be much better if you can do it you'd be much better

because something is a good feature by itself you don't really know how to behave in combination and so it's
combination and so it's to have as many together at the same time as possible and it's reasonable visual form their school graphic
form their school graphic things people have sometimes put together three or four and some funny way
but it's true that you should do any of that unless you know that the individual ones at least have some especially for normalized
some especially for normalized and i mean

distinct and i would imagine there should be some you know there should be the distribution is should be somewhat separated
and i would still that if they're not separated at all that there's some there's most likely something wrong in the way that
but for instance i mean i wouldn't expect that it was very common overall that's when two people were talking at the same time that it would that it really was lower although
i know that was a joke or
you know you're tone is going to be very different

because you know i'm not i don't have a good feel for how they should be sorted out and
what which your going to already have a date and this
but i don't know how to i don't know how to categorize i'm if you're actually hit
we i think roughly so if you could say you know ten years in the east coast five years in the west coast or something
we i think we don't want to get that level of detail at this form i think that's the right in the east coast five years in the west coast or something

just i don't think we should go through an elaborate thing
but jose and i were just talking about this speech energy thing did you really
maybe we shouldn't make any assumptions about distribution shape
the game and the fact that this game things grew

g. and like energies compressing the distances between things another
another that he needs to play with the different pepperell size is use
so we can talk at all about the other the river this but again
plus i think it has more elegant them the

because so they was saying that sound like a bachelor overlap meaning the kind that's
meaning the kind that's a friendly encouragement like great
and it doesn't take you don't take the floor
it sort of honing in on these different types of course now i don't consider that this was

and he stills and then if you look at the frame with respect to the it still should
some core things that'd be great if you're marking those and
forms next iterations of force stoops isn't
no hot fifty pages per person

but it is definitely true that we need to have the time marks and i was assuming
i agree coming off and i was assuming that will be inherited because if you have the words and they're roughly aligned in time forced alignment or whatever we end up using then you know this student i would be looking at the time marks and classifying
coming off of the other and classifying all the frames inside
coming off of the other good so wouldn't be it i wasn't planning and classifying all the frames inside those that's whatever label chain gave

i've sex i just been taking the beginning time of the meeting me too so @reject@
i've noticed that in the form of the meeting me too so @reject@
we of read mostly we went around us and then a lot of people ended up saying that it's
you speak or is that just where you're from

in form and everything below the line is digits that the user reads
off the new form thank you thank you very
i'm if you're if you this wasn't about but disease regions
if you if you're a t. this wasn't about but disease regions weren't

right it also should be later
just you know put the filter the speech and this is a lot of work you can't do without
the filter the speech and this is a lot of work you can't do without that i mean

size is use he's taking everything over two hundred twelve seconds
lower although sometimes as you say what
say boston new york city the south and regular

it's it between the pauses for some segment and
some segment and so he is he's making the constraint has to be at least hundred dollars seconds
so they'll be some cases for which @reject@ thirty million

of what and then just a normal i think that larger amount
and the one thing he's money i was when he looked at a bunch of examples in logged i mean it is actually pretty hard to see the change in you can sort of
so this is a real problem i don't know what to do about it

when the two seats and that's a problem right there so
overlapping but i don't
it's a sliding window right so if know

and when he's looking like i mean it's not really releasing so and he's
so and he's looking in state energy he is
i mean we're not paying him the full array ship for all the time so

but it's not a good man right so
do it in this case you three of the
at scatter plots because that's looking at the distribution in two dimensions let's start

and she's right that that having a having this table with a whole bunch of things with the same deviation the various of it's it's harder to interpret and just looking at the same kind of picture it's up
but the quit so they'll be
is i bought appointed to visual think

especially locally
i was just going to say that right now we're just exploring the other thing is that
where you would imagine eventually that you feed all of these features into some discriminated system and

that was a great overlap but with it because what if that's the case and i don't think this is true
my and the back channels are sort of easy to spot in terms of their words
and again what they you just listen to it so

so non linear operations doesn't affect change the sanction if you
the sanction if you doing and not if you want some fancy thing and then you and right now
you and right now we're sicily doings linear thing by looking across here and saying we're going to cut it

do it you'd be much better at doing it also because you
i mean there's not a lot of for of room
i think of those northern is the only one that i don't even know what they're meaning i don't think the northwest people speak any differently than i did that's exactly that's a joke do you come from the louisiana purchase so let's make it up so i mean who cares right we can make up our own so we can say northwest rest of west or something west i mean it doesn't even exactly that's not really a reasonable we could take out i usually see people here know what to do kind of and then in which i

because i like to eat that too if we'd known when i say we say day and of course you don't need it they windows they bite that if you've got a site time to fight type also the topic we say it's more windows
it if they fit the also the magician niece and that's about this on the bitty short
the window shouldn't be larger than the best i

but you it's more windows you know not
like you should definitely three times as big and your back channel then
your back channel then you're going to have a wash and hopefully it's more

good so wouldn't be it i wasn't planning to label the time marks i was thinking label chain gave i can give you my
to label the time marks i was thinking that would come from the i don't think you i can give you my show
marks i was thinking that would come from the engineering i don't think you need to i can give you my show

with i we could do a very bad one with broadcast news right so whatever you would label would be touched the words
is boston new england and they're proud of it and said anything as the day it and they're glad to tell use this
new england and they're glad to tell use this time

because we're doing another thing
this and see what people choose and
they're hardly any really not if you people and i

it just has a lot which is what you're supposed to read i
so south actually the only way i know is from working with you know and having to figure that
so i was actually so south midland like kansas figure that

so and the digits form everything above the line is a fill in form and everything about that
so i if you're a t. i.'er my th that from nineteen eighty five weren't
it is that what you would call yourself

so i was actually so south midland like kansas and north metal figure that
i was actually mean so midland like kansas and north metal and like illinois but it nor
and north metal and like illinois but

you know i think if you talking you thinking in terms of places as opposed to names different names people have given to different ways talking i would think north midwest and south midwest to be more common thing
i went this now it's the
i went this now it's the usage we

i mean i as i said i don't think there's a huge benefit to this region thing it
what's northern i
choose and then but then just fill and if they don't i

would think about a question like where are you from mostly do
but i'm not i should i really am confused by northern
i agree i really am i mean if

us and then a lot of people ended up saying that it's
i like the idea of asking what variety of english do you speak as opposed to where you're from you know
because if we start asking were from again you have to start saying if that the language you speak or is that just where you're from

don't think the northwest people speak any differently than i did i mean it doesn't even exactly that's
than i did do you come from the louisiana purchase exactly that's not really a reasonable we could take out
do you come from the louisiana purchase not really a reasonable we could take out i usually

we're arguing about we don't know but some it's it's harder in america than anywhere for people to know
but some of them are very obvious
but some of them are very obvious you if you talk to someone

it i don't know if it's a p. or something i forget the word
p. or something i forget the word for it but it's

people it starts to harden and then it's just harder for the ones to shift things and the
with the reasons and they just non

rest of it and one of them is the distance that she told of that get onto paper that hey it
real life by the way so we got a good intro here that she told of that get onto paper that hey it

we can edit that if you want it's that's optional
we can edit that if you want it's that's optional

right now he's not really showing any kind of distinction but we discussed a couple
there term means like over

did you take that might there but the long term means like
yes so that there's a good chance then given that different people do talk different amounts that there is there's still a lot more to be gained from gaining normalization of some sort of if

plus block access to log of x. plus a lot of too maybe it's not long
and it's just you know it diminishes the effect of having two of them

yes right so what i was suggesting i mean we don't know that the distribution here is normally so just some kind of simple
and they went up his own house

other thing actually you can have a question for adam in this
and again what they what difference there was would kind of be lost and taking the log so my and the back channels are sort of easy to spot in terms of their words you just listen to it so

it for the energy had for furniture
that that's a good did you have this sort of thing for just the right that be on normalized so no i haven't this is you know like

a that's might be just good to know what it looks didn't it before when
i mean i like it probably does happen sometimes case where you would never

let's start with that before get complicated if that was the most thing which is we're arguing if you take energy if you look at the energy that when too we were speaking at the same time usually they'll be more energy than when one right
that's sort of hypothesis and the firstly look

so i was three colors appreciates or whatever just look at this distribution
no prayer that way because if we can't do it that way there's no good way that we're going to be able to do it that

just look at this distribution
it's like with the other end we thought

and then given that as a basic can see if that gets improved you know or worsened by looking at regular energy looking at like energy who are is proposing
week and he said ten it what if we put involved

think that's probably the most basic thing for anything very complicated
and looking at you know if you can detect something that way because if we

and then we i think we're that pitch related things are going to be a really likely candidate to help
because of that most people when they're talking don't change their own energy when they get a back to because they're not really predicting

at the same kind of picture it's up too it i found the team they can day and nieces fight and said earlier and sort of things they do how finish because i don't we say hi to with energy
i knew course you're day and it or the chime in my eyes these big diesel too for some

but we just can't see it because there's too many combinations of people
i had the same intuition last last week i think it's seems sort of calm plaque

starting with something that you can see you know without the extra layers of right
because it's energy doesn't matter they're like i don't think this

but some of those as you showed i think can be discarded by the duration of the
actually this new student on who adam has met and he was at one of our meetings he's getting

attractive and all he has to do is change it from log plane energy and plot just a gram and look at it and
look at it and then you should go on and do the other big but

it just seems like come and we true before that to we have to it could pretty issue in this situation up and dropping
and n. b. c. will so energies and it looks as easy he's not to the at the same time

and then that should give us some indication that we know she gives some indication of whether there's anything to be achieved from energy at all
they might say other for reaching because they don't know what category use but they might have you know right

and then you can move onto to the more but related i seem to see
but then not physical

term in the city and i @reject@
term in the city and preparing too i @reject@ because i so you remade then

but i understood the that's it i have to finish by a woman we i couldn't take my in the heat and that sort of
but heat and that sort of

but that in itself is not informative without knowing what types of overlap they're involved in so
involved in so i was planning to do a tax on any of types are like service to that so that would be great that would be really

is it we have nothing you know
you know am i speaking with a german accent i don't

you know we got his environment setup he's a
he's a double e. you know so

it'll be interesting though to talk have you're willing to do that or
it'll be interesting though to talk maybe not the meeting but at some other time about what are the classes willing to do that or

she's like we also it's with reference out and you know it's always an interesting question i think this is this
like probably if we had to hire some like an undergrad because don is being covered half time on something else

because he supposed to work days sounds good chunk let's just say i say they type of position name
maybe it maybe correlated of position name position but short when we tough it's tough though dropping we speech he supposed

it get you fit he's stronger
stronger i mean they if it's not my station it was i mean not the million you defend that the you go either or do they wind up on beer that we state and admissions although dropping

window right so if you take the measure in the centers of the overlaps peace you know there'd better be some something but if your window
something but if your window is really huge then you

and they again with someone is speaking relatively consistent level just to give the an extreme example overeating's compensating
i don't know what to do about it i wouldn't know how to characterize

you were also talking about a couple different things i mean one is your possible to try both ways
a couple different things i mean one is your

if i. b. m. doesn't good that's good but but will do that later we have to truths are we supposed to keep recording
that right that's good later are we supposed to keep recording

because the user filled out the first three fields and i fill out the rest level question but you see came first
so it wasn't intentional it's an interesting observation how did

i've noticed that in the form that's the reason i put the time of the meeting me too so @reject@
that's the reason i put the time in it of the person who's extracting the digits meaning me will know where to look and me to try to find a did you dear we've been messing up your forms what me too

actually it's about one thirty each about one third of them are blank i'm about three businesses
about one third of them are blank about

about one third rumor run the digits or read about one
digits or read about one third of them are when the meeting starts

actually you could that does raise another very professional so
that does raise another question which is why is a professional use only nine not higher wages that come

i'm comparing the new one with the old one this is the digit
your time is with the old one this is the digit form

you know that's right the digit form doesn't have a four official use only lying it just has a
i don't think the northwest i mean it doesn't

so it's like we started with this now i got a new version of it with your said it
now that d. fields are slightly different

this form i think that's the right if we want to follow up
but this midland

and my c. but new england has a bunch of very different alex and
so i picked these regions because we talked and so does so do other places

is i almost exactly the same as switchboard region sort
region sort very close

northwest think originally it was it north northwest
or boston

mine either and so i would think i would say i've got a mix of california in ohio
i think at the first level for example we speak the same our dialects

maybe i should put a little map and say so
we could ask where they're from but we if you

we of read but we went back you said this thing
we of read mostly we went around

that's asking i mean it gives us good information on where they're from but that doesn't tell us anything i'm
i mean so i would that's asking if they're from us anything i'm not

can make up our own so we can say northwest rest of west or something west
the louisiana purchase we could take out i usually

and so what in our lives maine or something and that's actually good
it wasn't that long ago we had somebody here who was from texas who was that that he didn't have any accent but know it probably means or accent is very strong compared to sort of midwest standard

i was thinking something along that line because if you don't
because if you don't know then you know ruling out the fact that you're in after something if somebody doesn't

and if you say what friday v. g. region you speak please characterize
please characterize your accent they're going to answer yes

the region solicit so i know right is each one has pros and cons i mean we
so that's true right cons i mean we

won't they answered the same thing in another one is if you had to characterize yourself your accent
won't they answered the same thing they might

some because it is easier to have an open ended just what we might learn from
to have an open ended we might learn from what they say as to which ones to ask it

yes you i mean last name month election was that we felt people would have less that there's so
region was blank adjusted region

that there's so many types of varieties of these other languages and we are not going
languages and we are not going to have that many subjects in these different language groups and that it's

and i think that's the best way to do it
because of the problems we're talking about what

and the symptom is typically that you have to hold for their wages to see if in

fact my brother's turned logical psychologist and he

psychologist and he came within and a body h. tests which to get sound is are only three measurements that are good enough statistical pictures of all the rest of it and one

real life by the way so we got a good intro here

so this time the forum discussion should be very short right it also

good point because jane it's not here yet and

we can talk about the service but i think you know

we discussed a couple of possible things that you can look at

and one is that this is all in all again or g. and like energies

and and the other thing is that the it doing the striking if i mean and variance in me divided by the same deviation unlocked the main may not be right thing to do

did you take that might there but the long term means like

means of west

it between that we know means of west all the frames the conversation or the

it between that we know all the frames the conversation or the

we know that between neither or the things that

and then he's measuring up to frame level still

in you can sort of see that because it was just putting on a board that certain of log x. plus block access to log of x. plus a lot of too and it's just you know it maybe it's not long

but could you do like a c. d. f. there instead i mean we don't know that the

so what i was suggesting to him is so just some kind of simple

but i think also i think a good first indicator is when the researcher looks at examples of the data and cannot see a change in how big the signal is when the two seats and

when the two seats and that's a problem right there so i think you should

at least be able doing casual looking and get the sense hate or something there and then you can play

there and then you can play around with the measures

that's a good place to start

so i was the discussion we just had the

when you get the sampling over the speech segments or sampling over the individual candle handle start through the of the two equalization did you do it over just the entire everything on my channels he didn't try to find speech

no i just took over the entire is an entire channel

right so then that means that someone who didn't speak very much would be largely represented by silence

this was quite quick and dirty and it was just for listening is

for listening it seems to work really

you has since grams

and they don't look very separate

separate separate is it

separate is it the first debates of real friend you we felt any kind of normalization

but he didn't have it for the energy had the

so she's right that's a might be just good to know what it looks you know like if it didn't it before when

that's because i've mentioned scatter plots before but she's right i mean even before

right i mean even before you get to scatter plus just looking at a single feature looking at the distribution is a good thing to do

because if they combine these simple sweet people's is that i mean touched

and the firstly look at that i said she's actually right is that you would just

in this case you three of the silence and that's fine so

i had maybe made it too complicated by suggesting early on that you look at scatter plots because

let's start off just in one was this feature i

but since your intuition from looking at some of the data is that when you looked at the regular energy that it did in fact usually go up when two people were talking that's you know you should be able to come up with a measure which will match your intuition and she's

and either they some of all dropping this energy

a call and we i know that just because we face and they went

cases for which @reject@ thirty million

so even if one of the teachers does a good job but one type of overlap another feature might do a good job with another type of overlap right i mean the

and i mean it's really important to pick normalization that matches the distribution for that teacher and

but we don't really know which speakers overlapping with which speaker

them the right model will be easier but

but i don't know if you go through and you find adam because he has a lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has enough speech unjust

enough speech unjust three cases of adam the other person and overlaps maybe

and just look at the distribution maybe there is a clear pattern but we just can't

last week i think it's start with is this your seems sort of calm plaque

i think it's start with is this your idea simple starting with something sort of calm plaque

what to study and he's

you have to study everybody individually but it's a simple case a study this simple it's but

you have to study everybody individually but it's a simple case and the one that has a lot of data associated a study this simple it's to get rid of like that but the

but it's a simple case and the one that has to get rid of like that but the

and the one that has a lot of data associated with it to get rid of like that because the

these people talk more soft i don't think

or what more soft i don't think this has at all or

or what if the equipment with the equipment adjust somehow or some this has at all or they get louder

but i think that's what i was saying about different types of overlapped situation we don't have that but there

there are different types and within

i would actually still recommend so it might be something that we can help by categorizing some of them and then

because it would be the quickest thing for and he could

and he could he already has all the in place is

all the in place is just a gram mechanism is the this

is the this attractive and all he

and we labels and data for you and we said this is what we think is clean so you don't have

is clean so you don't have to worry about it and here's

to worry about it and here's three types overlaps we'll do the labeling

we'll do the labeling for

should different friend crossover about up

that we would be working on anyway about up

but i i was just saying that it that right now from the means that you gays i don't have any sense of whether even you know there are any significant number of cases for which there's distinct and i would

i turn that light off the flickering

that light off the flickering is annoying me

any of is really usually very low energy

so maybe those don't actually have much difference in energy but

would be lost no matter what you do

but tone might what these big i mean even if you take a lot you can your models is has a more sensitive

but tone might be very sensitive

tone is going to be very different

and that's the indicated we're getting

anyway we're not disagreeing on any of this look at it more and

look at it more and more finely but i think that this often happens you do fairly complicated things and then you stand back and realize have done something simple so

they have you started looking at the pitch related

pitch related term in the city and i

that's not what i meant no i be

i we certainly should see this but i think that the harm i'd certainly wasn't saying this

i'd certainly wasn't saying this is better than they to be in pitch related things i was just saying i

i understood the

but i think like all these derivatives and second derivatives all these other very fancy things i think i just of

things i think i just sort of look at the other g. and then get into i'm in the city

so maybe we're trying to compressed meeting

and i had adam had some form and one to talk about and

don't ask this something and just talk topic so when did you have some

topic so when i present and my results about the i just wish of overlapping speakers and profiles of speakers at the bottom of that i did have a proposal and i plan

proposal and i plan to go through with it of coke coating the types of overlaps people were involved in just with her friends to speak or style so you know with reference and you know i said

and you know i said that in my summary that you right

that you know i so it's like people may have different amounts being overlapped with her overlapping but that right

to that so but you know it's like you sounds like you also have something in that direction is it that would be really great we have nothing

should be sorted out and i really didn't go into that in just have you're

be interesting i think that's a research effort in and of itself because you can read the literature

be interesting because you can read the literature but i don't know how it'll turn out and i think

time so if it got to where we want we needed someone to do that i

know that and besides and the cost will drop depletion because he

maybe it maybe correlated when we tough it's tough though dropping we speech

he supposed to learn to call ice

call ice encouraging i seen took because she's a day and a window some of my station position

because see if he's with us that they pulled they pay no say over up to about china went up with a short position people she worked it because i like to eat

larger than the best i i mean that's your

i mean that's your house you cough about china today you coffee a lot up and so on smoked i knew

for some hey i'm on denny's

i'm on denny's not to hide

it i think if you if your or the chung to vermont i sent the chinese be good compared with it and we look up in insulation it

you white around the overlapping part wanted to include

it's a sliding window right so if

won't even the portion of the back you know won't want but you do you then they because it already it's more windows

i'm not that's necessarily true and hopefully it's more like new york

it doesn't impair i'm not that's necessarily true like new york

it depends how different your normalization is as you slide your window across i mean that's

simon anyway so somehow if once he gets going we're going to have to come up with

it's very inefficient you'd have to go in and measure every starting stop point next words is if you're interested in

it's very inefficient is if you're interested in anything it before

anyway so that degree great

if something we should talk about later maybe not

you mean on the digit form this is this rather low

excuse me the time is when you actually read the digits but i'm filling out the date before and if you

out the date before and if you look at the form in front of you that you're going to fill out when you read the digits you'll see i've already filled in the date but not the time i always

to try to find a did you i know dear we've been messing up your forms but i

to try to find a did you i know and i haven't said anything dear we've been messing up your forms they should call like did it start time but i didn't want him to be you know the making

and i haven't said anything they should call like did it start time didn't want him to be you know the making

and i haven't said anything they should call like did it start time didn't want him to be you know the making

what were you putting in

a lot of things we started major thirty i'd put two thirty i

i'd put two thirty i everyone was going two thirty and i

no it's about fifty actually didn't realize that all i'm about three businesses

no it's about fifty actually it's about one thirty each two thirty and i didn't realize that all i'm about three businesses

i could put instructions but either

but if i'm not at the meeting i can't do that start did digits on that's especially i

know that's a good point i see good point it's been setting up and going away for some reason

i see good point some reason doesn't want to sit through every

for official

for official use only

because if you're professionally use

your time is did you form the did you form i wasn't they just did

did you form the did you form doesn't the did i wasn't they just did

did you form the did you form doesn't the did you know that's right the digit i wasn't they just did

no either you really want to start with this other four

no either way's fine i just with this other four

way's fine i just you just start talking about something i didn't know which form you referring to right i was comparing said

know which form you referring to right i was comparing said

so the main thing that the person fills out is the name and email and

that's because the one this one has native language in this one does too

mean so what acting are we speaking it nor

i mean you could call whatever you want

for the foreign language we couldn't classify every single one so i just left it blank

so i just left it blank and you can put whatever what because you'd defend

and you can put whatever what because you'd defend despair space in which is the north of spain myself away from that

so i'm not what to do about the region field for english variety

you know what i wrote i was riding the staffing you know these are great if you're linguist but actually

i don't know how to i don't know how to categorize i'm if you're hit

not bad because it takes less time and three q. there's no figure just a little you know it doesn't that's like that's say with it

a little you know it doesn't have to have all the detail but sort of

i'm thinking you could have met multiple you're categorized

i mean i as i said i don't

the problem is that for some things it's really clear and usually listen to it you can tell right away if it's a new yorker boston accent but new

accent but new york and boston are too like if they have

so i picked these regions because we talked about payment and those so do other places right and so

about payment and those are right from tenet right and so these would be satisfying like a speech research community if we released the database

but as to whether subjects know where they're from i'm not because i know that they had to fill this out for switchboard's is i almost

i certainly a lot of people also north west so you got oregon washington oregon now which you people don't know if it's westerner norther

don't mean i say i don't even know what i speak it like northwest

am i speaking and my speaking western is northern

but maybe that maybe we could leave this and see what

i would think about a question like where are you from mostly i agree scandinavian the minnesota areas north but i'm not i should i really am confused by northern i really am i mean if you're in new england that's north if you're that's but that's also north midlands and if they don't i mean i don't know what else we can do that's north men but

i mean if you're in new england that's north if

right and oregon and in oregon washington our western but they're also northern of course that's very different from like michigan

and oregon and in oregon washington our of course that's very different from like michigan

there are how they any subject

they're hardly any subject from and i

we could ask where they're from if you

i mean so i would say germany if they're from not

i think of those northern is the only one that's a joke

i think of those northern is the only one that i don't even know what they're meaning that's a joke

up so i mean who cares right we

that's exactly we're arguing about we don't know it's it's harder i for people to know

you if you talk to someone speaking with a southern drawl you know

or boston i can't do it but him

they do and those people if you ask them to self identify their accent they know very

i agree they know they don't think the same

i agree and they know they don't think the same as the

i depends you time

i that's the problem with these category we that's why they have new york

we like boston that's why they have new york city

we like it we just say characterize something like kick characterize your accent and boston that's why they have new york city characterize your accent if you can't

like it we just say characterize something like boston city characterize

someone from boston what this really strong coloration would know and so what in our lives right which probably means you have a very and that's actually good

and so what in our lives maine or something and that's actually good i was thinking

it wasn't that long if somebody doesn't know it probably means or accent is very strong compared to sort of midwest standard

so i propose takeout northern and had they're pretty noticeable draw

so i propose takeout northern add don't know noticeable draw

so you want to change and i would say barbara sleeping lee how would you characterize your accent

so you want to change the instructions also not just say region

i if i read this forum i think they're going to ask it they're going to answer the same way if you say what's right even just you speak region

your accent they're going to answer the same way yes

saw i was suggesting not having reactions just

we talked about with that is so that they would understand grand you already yes but if as

yes but if as was just suggesting people who have strong accents no that they do

that's what i had before and you told me to list the region solicit and i know is each one has pros and

that's true last week it last week i was sort of or green for having a wide open we

having a wide open and everybody said no but the mobilely hard to interpret

but the mobilely hard to interpret because some people

i mean i had a wide open last because some people say cincinnati and summer so

some because it is easier to have an open ended just what we might learn from

just a small thing but i because i really don't know

but says variety and then it gives things that have american is one of the choices defenses region

defenses region by region actually just

by region actually just applies to u. s. right

groups and that it's a huge waste of space

so i mean i the way i had last time was region was blank adjusted

we're talking about what we said last week was no put in the less so

so should we go back to certainly we can make a list a little smaller

certainly dropping northern i think it's all right because none of us know what that is because i mean and keeping

the midwest one or midland middle submitted
