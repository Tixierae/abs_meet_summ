as most of you should know i did send out the consent form thingies and
i just meant that was the release date you had on d. they that's what i said
i either july fifteenth so that's right but
it makes it easy i don't my understanding of what we had upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that we don't actually need to reply
it's the other group it was the network services group i
so that we have a uniform thing so that
if someone says hey look i found something in this meeting and it's libel listen i want it removed what can we do we
i'm not saying you should change anything i'm what i'm what
i'm not as diligent as check but i had the feeling i
so we're assuming that that's that would be great if
have no intern only we know that people are there but we let me reverse
ways i mean and either way it works probably
it works probably i mean
except i really think in this case i
in this case i'm i agree with was that we need to be in the clear and not have
and not have to after the fact say but i assumed and i'm that
or how they would indicate from you know they probably forgot
would indicate we certainly didn't they probably forgot all about it
a problem i think that it's just common courtesy to ask them to expect for them to be able to have i just try to contact them and that's good
in these things but they were always come back saying that you need to if you want to have some to some paper trail which includes electronic trail that they have in fact it
i think that if we send email as you have an if there's
as you have an if there's half the people say who don't respond at all by you know some period of time we can just make a list of these people and
haven't given that so how far do we have to go do we need
we have to go do we need to get someone signature or
or is e. mail enough to be at
the thing i've learned from dealings things
just it's channel because you see that channel
time through and and i'm responding without having much knowledge but the thing is i am
say go ahead or something just re mailing yourself and then they're at the bottom
that's actually definitely good point to me
and we actually need a third thing is not that you've looked to the mail
so this they want to compare directly with his results they can't and
no these are our local transcription of the n. s. a. meetings the transcribers the top line those are doors
no these are our local transcription those are doors
and they very much a proof they much prefer the new ones and actually
the new ones and actually i mean i think that there'll be fewer things to correct because of the choice we originally chosen
so if we had every reason i think they would work so what see if there had sense yes
so if we had every reason i think they would work so what see if there had sense yes
they're just earphones their headsets

and we had decided that they have they only needed to sign once
at the we discuss length of time that we want to give people
these i would imagine it's a surgeon eric thing i would say because we continually be making these things available to other researchers this can't be open ended and so
i'm just saying should decide something i already did
and they can you know they can be asked to give the phone number and email address for both
they make it look like they want something in the lottery and then
they're served in the lottery and then they opened the envelope and that
but that's not sufficient
right because if someone just because it's the website that doesn't imply anything in particular
i don't think there's so recent these visitors i and
to find true i mean i will be able to if you have any trouble finding and i really think i could find other methods
that for every meeting
any meeting which has any belief in that we need yet another copy of
i you know i think at a certain point that copy that has the deletion will become a master copy it's
the way i did it which is the default is if you do nothing we're going to release it because
it because you know i have my stack of e. mails of to do to be done that you
think of it so i think it's a good idea think explicit time by which this will be considered definite release
and it has to be time earlier than that in point
point it's conversion this
a quick question how like wed bugs in the mail
and they're generally extremely good but you
good but you know and this area it really does pay to to double check and i'm hoping
exactly it's where we discuss that yes i was afraid people would say let's answer that because it's wrong and i don't
it's wrong and i don't want them to do that
it's short i mean if
it it's great double and that

say it's a good mike i really knows the signal level is
sunset not agenda items because until
we said last week there was there's the suggestion of alternating weeks on more automatic speech recognition related or not is that sort right
is that sort of the division switch weaker right
switch weaker when
i thought i didn't understand that there was somebody synthetic you
i mean as an added level of checking on the accuracy the transcription as i see it but in any case
so that's a month which is fine twelve
or they may never have gotten the email because although their rights
the email because although they sign this they don't know by which state to expect your e. mail and
what i'm telling you people don't respond to the email no matter
email no matter what you do they're going to be people who you have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with
then we make the effort we it's kind of like signing and do you want to spend that effort
i don't think so what are we going to do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with
you do are you play any data so i don't want i really would rather make a copy of it rather than bleep it out and then
a quick question how like wed bugs in the mail
mice expectation is that we'll send out one of these e. mails every time i'm meeting has been checked and is ready
that hey this is the term the
actually i have the thing is that if we have four people come to work for a day i was hanging on to the others for it for spears but i can tell you what nobody is but if you need no problem i just
but i can tell you what i recommend nobody is if you we should get a it but if you need it just gets it come on no problem i just
for it for spears but i can tell you what nobody is but if you need no problem i just
but i can tell you what i recommend nobody is if you but if you need it just gets it come no problem i just
so what's the other thing on the agenda i the only one
true i thought you meant the disk base we know that if it's a show
that's a the disk base we know that if it's a show that's what i thought too

i figure also if they're shortage and items that could also do a little bit of each
me for going to a policy in at the we discuss length
and so please give us back your was and this some you know was in the spot time i kind of agree upon did you read the email and
so that you can decide on something so i'm not telling you what
so i'm not telling you what to decide
by human subject so that's going to be a little if that's already
it doesn't have a time limit the process of
that you be provided access to the transcripts and then the review process
and how many people all i think we had better find but i'm not you mean not being a lawyer i wouldn't just want to do that without having the expert the opinion on that
my the things that were question where along the lines of how easy
you don't have to administrative staff whatever they'll right
but no this is different ins
we can meaning the last time and the transcriber thought little too much
instead of from something or other cards for multi cast

house we have of time given is
felt you wanted to jane told me july fifteenth so
just say that you know as per the or the paid you signed you have the ability to look over this so forth and
yes i mean i thought we had discussed this like a year ago and
here or it's eric and so on
file right because we're going to be releasing a whole file
archive and to preserve the older version you couldn't crypt it would be that hard right exactly see this is good i wanted to create some side conversations that's true that's true
and it seems like we've never gone unresolved
but the thing is i am like one of these people gets a gazillion males and that's
and comes in and that's exactly what i did it the way i did it which
and she'd been really busy with such as the waivers
the version beyond this is so instead

but i had the feeling i should probably respond until
if there is an advantage to having them admit and if i can help with
and how many people all i think we had better find the opinion on that
many people all together we've got twenty people these people are people who read the email almost all the time i look at this again i think we had better find out so that we can find out right on that
many people all together we've got twenty i think we had better find out so that we can find on that
home how much implication would there be that's it's likely you're going to be changing something as opposed to that
on the can't rely on the beep and then they could subtracting be you can hide it
can't rely on the archive and to preserve the older version be would be that hard right exactly see this is good i wanted to create some that's true that's true
because these forward backwards it really and go backwards
make out of that so the split upon on known it's split in principle cheney's
in principle no cheney's or from i. b. m. the top line spit upon

two options they can change it to one of them is censor and the other one is in correct
by human subject so if that's already
only we know that people are there but we have no confirmation let me reverse this
or how they talked about that or the date at which they would be receiving the email from you know
you know go to this website and
that one that's why you never open website and you've
you know an official from somebody is better than no answer even if they responded that they got your email and i'm probably more
but in fact if we sent them something we thought we sent them something but they didn't actually receive but for some reason then we haven't given that so how far do
if they don't submit the form it goes in the general web log but that's not
any the extremes we've talked about because

but i thought we @reject@ last did meeting recorder last week so i thought we
so what follows at some point you go
at some point you go around and get people to sign something no
and the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity so as
you have to do all of them you need all the channels
was goes with it you spread spectrum hide and these meaning so
thousand here we go it in there you go
they're not headsets they're not microphones
added order they're pretty inexpensive i mean one of these we should order of a two or three or four actually we have i think i have a pet

so i think and if you disagree with that one and you read it and give me comments on it
you know specify exactly what you know how they will be contacted
because people don't read their e. mail or the and say i don't
or the and say i don't care about that i'm not
applied like they used to
right because the and then the thing is served so you just
so what it says in there in fact is that they will be given an opportunity to blah but in fact if
if they submit the form i get it
so again hopefully this shouldn't be quite as early as a problem either way

and so far everyone has done email there is and anyone
have to deal with that if we wanted to
at it said you've looked at it and agree with one of the possible actions right you can do that you know you
isolated the text i'm just saying that it's
i agree with you maybe is that the way it's going to be using chain
so different but it's i mean if that's any good that these effects i mean
i mean one of these two or three or four
not actually we have i think i have a pet that i brought from home but its just for music
to e. mail out the brand

and someone doesn't respond
do we delete every meeting that they were in
it we're hoping that doesn't happen but that's
that doesn't happen but that's why there's such a thing as registered mail or that will happen that would
come back with and we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things but they were always
high tech aspect of it but i think appreciated no i actually don't
five so i don't have to buy go borrow it from
but i can tell you what i recommend nobody is if you but if you need it just gets it come no problem i just

it you know but sometimes that's right we haven't experienced it before
and find out what the status is on this because i don't want to do something
bull this because i don't want to do something that we don't need too because
about because we're talking a pretty small number of people for this that i'm not worried because
has jeremy signed the form i hadn't thought about that
signed the form i hadn't thought about that
do you have to do the other close talking as as all of the yes
i also from the standpoint i mean

we probably should talk about because it because
or that happen because people that would happen
what are we going to doing here it might be the case that this is perfectly you know this is enough to give us a basis to just assume that consent if they don't reply
on that's unusual but so my original impressions
unusual but so my original impressions was that was sufficient
advance of benefited from some of these cross group meetings

we had spoken about this before and we had decided
was that they chosen you just
was that they chosen you just felt you wanted to jane told me july
i thought synthetic you would
german dutch swiss in spanish all non native

you said you wanted it to be available then i didn't mean
local except the ones who i mean we were done
ones who i mean we were in contact with all the ones in those two groups
then we make the effort we it's kind of like signing and do you want to spend that effort
make the effort up for a mailing list of opt in and opt out and they're two different

i didn't mean it to be the hard deadline is fine with me if it
definitely good point to me e. mail doesn't specify that you can just replied to the email as opposed to going to the foreman
are i could tell you were there without any difficulty in
envy i so i you there these logos
we've harder but we also someone else coming and it's going to help us out with and so

is fine with me if it is or we get
approving uncorrected
this is the first cycled about a b. c. which is the first time through so and if it makes
and then i also the final thing i have for transcriptionist that i made a purchase a some other headphones because
they're just earphones they're not headsets

it's the other group it was the network i
and then they find this thing is in there and we varies
is in there and we varies distributed someone so what
i could do it either way i mean the question
do it either way i mean the question of how distracting is to the people have to do the checking

and say on the fifteenth date is releasing you want to do something
i kind of like this
you have to do all of them you need all the channels
and also doesn't give a specific i didn't think of it so i think
watch a watcher country it's i mean if you want to go we can sort of it

but what if we release like twenty five meetings to people
is later in i don't know how this going to work out but i thought
you're right so we got the transcript back from that one meeting everything
in soon i mean i the thing is i need is to hang it off like person's coming it's in all these computer so you mean that the
and if you're going to go out but new discs or the exodus

learned too much which makes more sense in technically as and these
as oldest and these depressive he's where
oldest that's a convention frantic hitting on certain so on certain it's
that's a convention frantic hitting on certain so on certain it's
hitting on certain so the transcriber was right you know she was

and he's got it so and so no reply is no changes
and he's got it so that the default thing you see when you look at the pages
and i thought that we had even down by the lawyers asking about that and they said
that and they said you have to they've already signed away the full with that for they've already signed once

i'm what i'm i'm trying to spark a discussion hopefully on people who have read it so that you can
says nobody really it anyway and this and the what is by human subject so says that right if that's already
or they may never have gotten because if you do this and you then there's a dispute later and some you know someone who understands these matters concludes that they didn't have you know enough opportunity to actually exercise their rights
you get it right you'll either wonder at the beginning or you wonder at the end

so and that's what's in the email and if you disagree with
yes we did it right it you know but a year ago and so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again
me because they feel about contact information that's run
information that's run sending information and so

because if someone it he you're right sometimes
could do that but i hate to have but it on but it only works for
could do that but i hate to have but it on but it only works for you know mine capable you
it's social and discourse

we did that i believe and then
they've already signed up for
in the form says and nobody so and this says
we make the effort it's kind of like signing up for a mailing list of spend that effort

so what i wanted to do was just send it out and say
work because it might benefit us in terms of getting responses
they lawyers do is they always look at worst cases having lots of spam
so they so that's what they're paid to do and so

think it'll be and also we want to ready by the fifteenth that mean to bear given deadline of the first if
but really it's q. s. in advance
file server so markings ordering and they should be coming in soon so i mean
and if you're going to go out but new discs or the exodus

because if you're summing anyway left of the original originals
but we never also was also never done it so
there these logos that you can put at the bottom of your webpage like powered by the
so i'll be doing that checks

you know she was on certain about that
she's right to be uncertain
and it's also a good indication of the that the next one
the next one this was about a claudia and she'd been

it's just understand this is this
understand this is a lot of jargon
and the final one
the transfer birds in the corn at work itself

you tell them july fifteenth
swiss in spanish all non native
right so and then you know say very clearly that if they don't if we don't hear from them you know it's more suggested by a certain time or after a certain period after we contact them that is implicitly giving their agreements

i just meant that fifteenth so that's what i said
exactly i didn't mean to isolate them otherwise known the german dutch dutchen spanish
classes a lot of terminology and

that's right that's why no the only mention i recall about that was just that july fifteenth or so is when this meeting starts so
already you delete the old one and put the new i delete the old ones
i delete the old ones at the new one and there's nothing

it but in any case people can agree to things that are wrong so
the only thing missing is some way could respond easily to so it's going to mean
my first born children are yours and you know acknowledge

the form it gets process and emailed to me
i don't want to say the meetings that are involved in et cetera buses and meeting recorder
d. german ones will be ready for next week was

july fifteenth year
fifteenth year two weeks before
archive and to preserve the older version would be that hard right exactly see this is good that's true

so my feeling is if someone after the fifteen says i suddenly found something we'll deleted from our record we just won't deleted
we just won't deleted from whatever's already been released
not worried because we know everyone on it

it's true i agree that part have to remember that
it's true what can we do we have to remember that
i agree that part but i think that would be a

time i kind of agree upon because i did you read the email and look at the pages i sent
that's how these mailing houses works i mean it's not completely
and we actually you might as just respond to the mail you know if you use netscape or something like that for aaron

line the one thing that i did read that you just repeated to me was that you gave the specific dated july fifteenth and
and you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it too so what i'm right
so what i'm telling you is that what you should do is come up with at length of time that you guys think it's enough right

and you should use that rather than the state that you just got from someone that's all i'm saying
i have one question this is in the summer
one question this is in the summer period and presumably

of town but we can make me some she can't we that they will be receiving email most of the month right
different ins in the mail that was a
just about i'm @reject@ we that was about and then when you clicked on it would send a you know ever actual acknowledge mints too the sender that you had actually looked at the man

we did that i believe then right so
like what the question is just whether how active it has to be me because they feel
but i bet they're so how often

human subject so that's going to be a little hard to modify already
the farm about a form doesn't say if you know if you don't respond by x. number of days or x. number of weeks so what does it say about
or x. number of weeks it doesn't have a time limit that you be provided access so what does it say about the process of the review process

know you can read what you already signed
i when i read it i'm not
and i think if you go into a room and close the door and ask their permission out there doesn't seem that's the intent

of like this so we're assuming that that's that would be great
i mean it's not completely lost work because it might benefit
i and i'm probably more likely to do that once they've responded that they got the email

i mean we have no intern
people are there but we have no confirmation and that they got him out let me reverse this so let's say someone i send this out
and that they got him out so let's say someone i send this out and someone doesn't

care about that i'm not going to believe anything and they
going to believe anything and they don't just won't reply to it maybe do we have mailing address is
don't just won't reply to it no maybe do we have mailing address is for these people

it you know but sometimes we haven't
still here we filled our burden
i just if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe i will call the attorney about it

is this and would you please mail email adam that it is it's it's you know is or not so
please responded please indicate you receive this mail
so the only thing missing is some way could respond easily to say go ahead or something just re mailing yourself and then they're at the bottom right so it's going to mean

if you're going to if you're predicting that you might not answer you have a chance now to say that
and the other given all my email to respond at that point saying you know what i'm probably not going to get to it or whatever rather
rather than just having seen email thing can make it too and never really

i was thinking too and never really pushing myself to actually do it until it's too late
i was thinking that it also lets them know that they don't have to go to the page to accept this it's too late right that's true
so that way they could they can see from that email that if they just write back and say i got it no changes they're off the hook they don't have

you do are you play ping it by adding than bleep it out and then
so it's exactly a censor bleep
say that is it something signals already you delete then i want to

did you read the paper they
and if you do wouldn't work the speech recognize still works
and if you do it backwards

that you know fifty or sixty long and the ones at the top
and the ones at the top i'm never going to get and
meetings the transcribers version worst versus the checked version i see

that's interesting you can a lot so
confirm that they read it no this is different this is not so
right can do that you know you can put this button anywhere you want and you can put

six there are three meetings this time or something or how many six
recognition compatible transfers
to show you some of the things that turn up during checking procedure

that we can also point them the the original meetings
they can grab those two with a c. p. so you put the reference
a c. p. so you put the reference files

so this is from one of the and i said meetings and
and if you're familiar with the different out there it's a lot just what it was it and they're to the right
it and they're to the right is what it was change too so

this is so instead of saying or especially
especially those words all zone old and some other ones those sneak in
the next one that's discuss markers

next one that's discuss markers discuss
discuss smokers
and it's and it makes us because it's like below this

then you got instead of from
this was changed in akron initially it shouldn't
initially it shouldn't have been

actually no but i bet they're acoustically challenging parts anyway though so how often
i mean this is because the you know you don't realize in daily life how much you have top down influences and what you're hearing and that's but
it's jar is jargon coupled with a foreign accent that's but we don't i mean our language

the problem do any better right you're probably one not
do any better you're probably one not so different but
they're not microphones no i mean just

i also from the standpoint of getting people's approval if someone sees
they would have in stock good idea
have in stock good idea to e. mail

is that a wireless or
doesn't mean you can't hear anything during old school

causes in essence it's really good might actually
i shouldn't say it's a good mike i

items because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item and now we have to
so just repeat the thing if that we said last week there

probably the thing about speech recognition last week too
that but i think it's good to be start some place like that so

seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted again
it's just i hate deleting any data so

if somebody is going to come back and say i want this and this use currently would need sometime to respond to that right i just i read
just it's channel because you see that channel

right i just i read i just got one day and that's i
number of people for this that i'm not worried because

so you have it nicely set up so they email you and
when they submit the form it gets process and emailed to me

week was just retrieve those different set of people
different set of people and we can impose the german

spoke loosely the german french the german dutchen spanish ones spanish
those are the n. s. a. meetings the non native

it's the other group it was the network services i
so on what you but after that when we're caught up a bit on this process then i could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available

was not the best characterization what
explicit deadlines something like a week before that july

but i think that would be a that we need to have a message to them very clearly that beyond the state you can't make additional changes
i think that somebody might request something even though we say

you do that and then make comments on what you want me to change
of this we had talked about this before and i thought that

period and presumably people may be out of town but we can make
i'm @reject@ we could do that but i hate looked at the man but it on

and if you don't hear from me by then you know in other words responding to your email once right away sink as soon as you get this could you please respond and then if you right
and then if you if the person thinks so me more time because they're out of town or whatever they can tell you at that point because

but the ones form which was just generic contact information
and they're downloading be audio files so i'll be

i mean there's no way to get around
it's pretty much the same amount of work except for an additional

way to have it on record you talk to them and she talked to earlier about it
henderson works just down the street these from like you just go and

we certainly didn't talk about with them at all about the manner of them being made it the materials available that was something all about it we did like with these
of them being made it we did like with these

it doesn't matter it's just we've gone from one extreme to the other where at one point a few months ago more unless you were saying let's not do anything and now we're right no i it might be the case
it doesn't we've gone from one extreme to the other where at one point a few months ago more right no i it might

we're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature i mean it might not
get a signature i mean what are we going to doing here it might be the case that

people these people are people who read the email look at this again out
i really don't see that it's a problem i think right

so you can do they're saying that there's a psychological effect that these for most people that if they've responded to your email saying yes i will do it or yes i got your email they're more likely to actually do it later than to just ignore it of course
it of course we don't want them to plead things out but it

i worry that says things that things like this a few times employers now so
employers now so i'm pretty comfortable

you know they're all more or less here or it's
right that are going into the main file server so markings ordering

the there is and anyone who did any other contact method
the way if she goes people who we're here ten years ago still have work of forwards to other conference on that's method

still here they just come back that if they give us contact information i contact information isn't accurate that we filled our burden
they just come back us contact information i contact information isn't accurate

for all the reasons that we discuss so supposed
discuss so supposed to be figuring out and then we'll see how

or it wouldn't even additionally even if
is even if you've decided you have no changes you'd like to make if you could right that respond to the email

is right that respond to the email
is the first time through the cycle right that would definitely work on me

is the first time through the cycle right that would definitely work on me you know it makes you feel
you know it makes you feel more like

off the hook they don't have to go to the web page
the thing i've learned from dealings things people sending interviews and so forth is if you say you've got three months to do this or do people do it you know too and seven eight months from now if you save right

there's a responding partners also
partners also what if

what if i mean i hope this doesn't happen when if
this doesn't happen when if there are bunch of solutions to have to get put in changes than actually right

that there you go because we don't have enough aside i have an idea you reverse this you know so it's
there you go backwards you know so it's like people say what they said backwards

then you have like a criminal messages and but have you seen this
a criminal messages and have you seen this speech recognition system that reversed very short segments did you read the paper

because these forward backwards it really and go backwards
was backwards forwards go backwards that's right good point

i'm if i sound a little peeved about this whole thing it's just we had
whole thing it's just we had meeting after meeting out on this and it seems like we've never gone

is not that you've looked at it said you've
we sent them the transcript correspond to those six meetings

mail back it's yup reply
very i like the high tech aspect of it but i think no

i use v. isolated the text mail reader it's at but i
i use v. isolated the text mail reader it's at but i

i use v. i mail reader at but i
that's my guy how

i if you're in both these types of meetings you'd have a lot but
i mean it also depends on how many

that's a good idea that we would happen have a bunch all at once made
that's a good idea a bunch all at once made

but this was the biggest club i could do buy a time where i thought it was reasonable people be able
people be able to check it still ever ready by then my

the o'clock too because then another they have it's in the category it's not quite so distracting
have to be as a separate order added order that they're they're pretty inexpensive still i think to get a pair too i mean one of these we should order of a

it's going to have to go through our regular process you're the one thing i notice is it did
the segment it's not that i b. m. people didn't do it

there a fair number of b. as in is that it's just that aren't in there
but i think like you said i mean that's got to be a standard process with the transcribers

with the transcribers going most of the time doing i would imagine once we yes
one question once we yes

we can talk about offline there's another
there's another meeting in here what it's for

so we have to finish by three forty five to do so does washington does he w.
so we have to finish by three forty five to do so does washington does he w. one they do this i want to use this data for recognition of something else

sometimes some speakers and search foreign language terms that's the next example
that's the next example the next one

because it's like below this little subliminal or
next one that hey

this is the term the problem with terminology description a with the
description a with the transcribers x. as an advance but really

not the internet on known
and it comes through is in the corner work itself of the access provider not the internet

check and i'm hoping that when be checked versions are run through the recognizes that you'll sees substantial improvements in performance because we
in performance because we know there are a lot of these in there

that would be the same people said i don't approve of because of the that's not what i say
exactly it's where we discuss that's not what i say that's exactly i put the extra option then yes i was afraid

exactly it's where we discuss that yes i was afraid people would say
because of the problem will gain an original and

originally chosen very expensive had headsets but
but they're just not as good as these and this with disrespect to this particular task it's probably returned over

it's probably impeding snatching problems over
i don't know say but we chosen because that's what's been used here by prominent projects in transcription so if see

have to be as a separate order added order that they're they're pretty inexpensive still i think to get a pair too we should order of a
have to be as a separate order it that they're i still i think to get a pair too

not just get but its just for music listening and it's not
not just buy them get the model number and but its just for music listening and it's not

it sounds like people are
it sounds like people are interested so

it's made a difference and i really
i really something i should talk about so what's the other thing

it it's great and discourse level and
and discourse level and

suspects phrase but no as i was no
we've just ordered a hundred gigabytes us out with and so

writing so we're probably going to need a lot more we're probably going
a lot more we're probably going to need that just how to not eighteen gig harder but

adam what are some like that jeremy fine

it's the mike

syria causes in essence it's really

we haven't really started but i thought

last week so i thought we could do

so far no one has made any comments on them so no

on them so no one is bleeped out anything

i don't expect anyone to but

and how long so as long as we do that were covered

and how long of an opportunity did you tell them

given is that long

but i thought it might be good to remind people two weeks prior to that in case

in case you know by the way it's your last

about because it because if we want to be able to give it to people july fifteenth if somebody is going to come

one day and that's i is so but

is so but i can send it follow up i mean it's almost all

up i mean it's almost all of us

that's right was my response i just i mean the people who are in the media at this meeting was these the meetings that in our that one

that's right was my response i just meetings that in our that one

response i just throw you replied to the email thing they're all fine right and that's fine

i just didn't member we just need to tell them that they can do it if they want

clear all the way down the page and they have

and they have two options they can change

correct these jurors incorrect which means also right

which means also we get feedback on if there's something of that they would that needs to be adjusted because

because these are very highly technical things i mean as an added

and the reason i the reason i did that was just so that people would not censor not asked to have removed because it was transcribed incorrectly

and the reason i liked it was because as opposed to

liked it was because as opposed to

was because it it gives them the option of being able to correct it

and we can impose the german ones

spoke loosely the

didn't mean to isolate them was otherwise known the german dutch dutchen spanish

what i meant to say was that it's the other day or it's not no overlap with our present members

and then maybe be good to set an explicit deadlines

i mean i suggest we discuss me for

that's a month which is fine it seems twelve hours the only thing i said in the email is that the data is going to be released on the fifteenth i didn't get any other

i didn't get any other debt on

that's a little bit difficult released

some place like that so if we how long it is a reasonable amount of time for people to have if we say two

have if we say two weeks or if we see months maybe

decide something i already did decide something

so and that's what's in the email and if you disagree with

i think that there's one missing line the one thing

because if someone it he you're right sometimes somebody will be away and

and you know there's it for any length of time that you choose there's some person sometime who will not and debris

it's you know it's a certain tank

should be hello

you should be channeled b.

you know when the whole thing starts when they signed that

in the form says and nobody really it anyway so and this and the what is says that right

and then allowed to remove things that you like to before it goes to the general larger audience

should probably respond until adam like i got this and i will do it by the state

i didn't want to do that because i don't want to have a discussion with every person if i can avoid it

but you should probably have legal person look at this and

person look at this and make it's because

and so someone who's machine is down or whatever i mean we

we have what they put on the speaker form which was just

but the ones who are dealing with now are all local except the information done

so maybe i you know that's not that many people and if i if

and if i can help with processing and i is

and i is if is an unfinished having to be on record as having received email and indicating i mean i thought we had

work except for an additional email just saying they got the email and maybe

and maybe it's better legally too wonder before you know a little earlier

it's much easier to know a little earlier than

it's much easier to explain this way to than you talk to

explain this way to have it on record you talk to them and she talked to earlier

have it on record them and she talked to earlier about it

and they're two different ways i mean and either way

and i'm that your e. mail address was just accumulating mail without notifying you know if this is

you know if this is a purely administrative task we can actually have a minister ish do it

but the thing is that you know i think without going through a whole expensive things are lawyers from my previous conversations with them my censoring much is that we would want something on record as indicating that they actually were aware of this we

they've already signed once

i don't remember that this issue of the time period allowed for response was ever covered

we never really talked about that or the date at which they would be receiving

available that was something that was sort of just within our implementation we can is it they can use

within our implementation we can is it they can use applied like they used

you know that when they serve like

you know like deadbeat dads they

that one why you never open it's just

it doesn't matter a few months ago more unless you were saying let's it might

not do anything and now we're saying we have to follow it might be the case it might

to contact them and just in case they hadn't gotten there you know i think

my aunt and my view before was about the nature of what was of the presentation

something as opposed to that was the kind of dispute i was making before but

but the attorneys i i can guarantee you turn east will always come back with and

of these people and hand to you know just give it to me

staff whatever they'll just call them up and say you know have you right

so you can do they're saying that there's a psychological effect

things out but it a little bit better forgetting the final response once they've answered you once and if they never answer you at all that's how

i think they just simply appreciated i think it's a good the email

i think it's a good way of drinking willem or something

yes i think there are things they lawyers do is they always look at worst cases so they so that having lots of spam

paid to do and so it is certainly possible that somebody server would be down or something and they wouldn't actually

and they wouldn't actually here for mass and then they find this thing

it emails now is e. mail enough to be at seven notarize i mean

it is e. mail enough to be at seven notarize i

do you track when people log again

that's except that you know they got the mail right

right i could get two on the notify list if you want me to i'm already on it

but for some of the others you're talking about visitors who are gone for make see who was e. mail addresses may or may not work

the prominent enough they're easy to find true i

because it what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission

that's the intent of the union here so

to be figuring out and then we'll see how many people respond to that email

i think very to that email talk two people have so

i think very few people oil and so

few people oil and you know people see long emails about things that they don't think it's going to be high priority that typically don't read or half read it right

and actually people are swamped

i didn't anticipate the so i

anticipate the so i that's why i think it is common in it i

common in it i this discussion is made me think it might be to have a follow up email within the next couple of days saying by the way you know we want to hear back from you by x. date

and please and then add what was said

and then add what was said please

whereas i mean i would be much more likely myself

accept this i mean i right that's true

from now if you save got three weeks to do this or do they do too and you know some days weeks from now they do the review and right

we make it a little less time i don't think it'll be and also we want to ready by the

of the first if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time

than actually have to deal with that if

do you have to do the other close talking as as all of the yes

you have to do all you could just do it in that time period though but i it's there's lot cross talk

you have to do all you could just do it in that time period there's lot cross talk

though but i it's a pain

you have to copy the whole file right because we're

because if you're summing at the new one and there's nothing left of the original originals

and then i would you easy to get it back again

and then i was going to say also that the they don't have to stay on the system as you know because and someday we can tell the unedited version say

was going to say also that the they don't have to stay on the system as you know because and someday we can tell the unedited version say

it's been successfully bleeped can't rely on the incredibly or will tell people the frequency of the beep and then they could subtracting you can hide it

bleeped can't rely on the incredibly or will tell people the frequency of the beep and then they could subtracting you can hide it

on the can't rely on the beep and then they could subtracting be you can hide it

archive and to preserve the older version would be that hard right exactly see this is good i wanted to create some that's true that's true

you couldn't crypt it was goes with it you spread spectrum hide i wanted to create some side conversations and these meaning so that's true

you couldn't crypt it was goes you spread i wanted to create some side conversations and these meaning that's true

was goes with it thousand that here we go you spread spectrum hide it in there you go and these meaning so because we don't have enough aside i have an idea you

that because we don't have enough aside i have an idea you reverse this

was backwards forwards go backwards that's right good point

and comes in and that's exactly what i did it the way i did it which

moving to the bottom and so

that's right this i've seen this recently i got

recently i got you know and

you know and it if i use them i'm capable mail reader and actually says you know click on the spot and to confirm receipt off the mail

do that certified mail you can a lot of mail or support return receipt

do that certified mail you can a lot of mail or support return receipt but it doesn't right

but it doesn't confirm that they read it right no this is different

right this is not so i know you can tell you know the mail delivery agents to confirm that the man was delivered to your mailbox but no this is

and we actually you might as just respond to the mail something like that for aaron

of the possible actions right you can do that you know you

i see my first born children you want and you can put at the bottom of the message and say you by you know by clicking on this i agree you know acknowledge

are i could tell you were there without

but why shouldn't any difficulty in even pretty simple mime readers can do that so

but why shouldn't they just e. mail back do that so yup reply

right you reading know envy i so

but not of different people's i if you're in

if we release this time it's a fairly small number meetings but what if we release like

so this time was just the first child so that was my intention it's just that we would happen have

so this time was just the first child so that was my intention it's just

that we could do it i could i'd be happy with either way back twice

we had i had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready don't have it

by then my i was thinking that would be an essay meetings i like there are three of them and they're

of them and they're i have them done by monday

unfortunately the time is later in i don't know how this

going to work out but i thought it be good to have that releases the o'clock too because

it's not quite so distracting to them is what i was thinking and

from that one meeting everything seemed fine adam had a script

adam had a script whole everything back together and there was there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix

and then we i sent him pointer two three more

and so he's off and working on this no we haven't actually had

working on this no we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting to see whether the transcript is correct and to see how

that's is correct and to see how much was missed and all that sort of so

that's on my list someone of all that sort of so at some point we need to do that

process you're the one thing i notice is it did miss a lot of back channels there a fair number

one question once we yes

one question about that actual you suppose that was because

you suppose that was because they weren't caught by the precinct signature yes

interesting yes

interesting

they're not in the segment it's not

so just they didn't get marked

so maybe when the detector for that it's better i

i there's another issue which is this we've

which is this we've been contacted by university of washington now of course to we sent

doing that checks

i pointed them to this set that andreas put on me so this they want

no they want to the audio jane

want to the audio jane sent them the attraction i mean of the transcripts

mean of the transcripts

i think they're doing once and that was your language

and that was your language modeling on you know recognition compatible transfers

one so then we started we can meaning the last

really he was we learned too much which

next one

one this was an interesting one so the

one so the original was so that's not so quality is not the bad master here

here and he'll pass but it really webmaster

and he'll pass but it really webmaster

webmaster

and i see another type of uncertainty which is you know they just didn't know what to make out of that so

my checked version after i go through it

and set of and system related in the system related this was changed in akron

and then you see here g. p. s. was that interpreted

or the exit unknown not the internet

provider not the internet backbone core classes a lot

it's starting so it's just jargon

coupled with a foreign accent but we don't i mean our language model right now doesn't know about the fourth anyhow so

the problem do any better you know i'm until you actually get a decent language model right you're probably one not

if someone sees a page full of barely decipher bull you know sentences and then is asked to approve of it or not it's that i say that

to this particular task it's probably returned over

no i mean just your phones

because i i could use on my workstation just sit

and because sometimes have to listen to on your five so i don't have

just buy them get the model number and where do you buy listening and it's not

henderson where do you buy these from like

on the agenda i the only one was dawn wanted to talk about disk space yet again

watch a watcher country it's you want to go we can sort of it

country it's true of it i thought you meant

the disk base we know that if it's a show that's what i thought

that's a great ambiguity what it is too

double see if i had and that was really good

double see if i had and that was really good

double thank you see if i had that little scratch pad i would've made an ex there was really good we'll

thank you that little scratch pad i would've made

an ex there we'll give you one then

without thinking about it when i offered up my hard drive last week as no

suspects phrase as i was no

but no i i realize that we're going to be doing a lot of experiments for this paper writing so

we just need to i think we need like another eighteen gig disk

or we just need to i think we need like another eighteen gig disk to be safe

getting three thirty city sixes right that

file server so markings ordering and they should be coming in soon so i mean

in all these computer or we can move them no so you mean that the this on the machines i we just got
