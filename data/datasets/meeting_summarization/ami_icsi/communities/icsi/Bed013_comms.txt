a day and then i'm going to meet the very big boss close to lobster and so forth and these esteem system integration people and because of something
you're in the hands thing and twenty two like now i was able to write messages also to generate based upon situations i
something else and enter
not be right and they would is on the order twenty output nodes and something like twenty
excuse me twenty times so
what's that guy's name
i went into a call
of the conference in like a what they're looking for or whatever
and take a where it's and
and how we if seniority you psycholinguistics the construction gramma really much of anything envision understanding that
so we can actually show how old we parse it
and keys and or draw no we'll go probably
you have no you know we can't ride in a. c. type paper or say it done this and i wear
more accused for us to find it are like afternoon john overload and
would be like this is the idea i made around and there's a paper that i have we consider
and say this is bad i never can
we decided that they are we going to take a wary something creche and
i do remember you talking to me what you said
begin endemic to look up keys i was
then grip i was what we so since this since the sort of technical is going over my and the
and furthermore i mean we can idealize that you know people don't change topics but
but gee and exactly how that gets activity you know like whether we want the sentence how do i get there to activate at notre not you know that's sort of the issue that sort of linguistic aside has to deal with

the news for me is a my forthcoming travel plans
newer guys i mean they train for millions and millions of people so
talking about billions and billions and
two to thirty is like it buster said we
buster said we can't get it out and buster believe that the flyers and the number of particles in the universe
to that's just that's side civilian right
it's the thirties a billion but if we do it
big he no we can't live a different number four how do they do that
iverson hours and hours here
many quitting whiny we need winnie
four pages on those it's just like four paid
that it has a location or something or the montel hotels
or the montel hotels were actually it is located no

aid that like what we did
and be is planning to come here either three weeks in july or two weeks in august actually work
k. e. so this is so weird attribute and make you happy
so and instead of just being every to observe phenomenon that's the intentionally might be able just given intention and making producing entrance
situations i mean that sort of thing
once you've done that what we can do is have the system ask
and enter a dial awkward itself from the
things if we can get it to understand one thing like our where is run through we can also maybe make it say or ask or not
now we change nothing to say ask something
so the test every output nodes i would at least
it's easy to two thirty for every output note
how that's the kind of we feldman
the idea is even more general the

don't know i'm sort of have the impression that getting it to say the right thing in the right circumstances is much more difficult than getting it to understand something given the circumstances and so you know i mean just this it's
how that's cherry feldman
many quitting so whiny we need i think winnie
so interesting both like child language people i think
this is your opted to cut
god i hope not
gee
some generic information
and how do i get to is always ask for the person just wants no it's got there
and that's the thing that is being that is the content of the question i think very by one interpretation where sex
and another one is pap from current user for location too that locations so

care on the fourth of july
you wouldn't know what to ask me
that's big
because if the of the noted for every or career than that to it twenty times and i do
it takes a second to each one and it's twenty billion then that's twenty million seconds which is
asking that's what we should we discuss this over tea and all of
and all of us look at the web i can't i'm
lucky you annex in over two weeks from now we're in a week
i didn't do that's from work to run a guy that's i think that's anyway and probably not i

but i just lying on the times though
enough turns it would be but based on that extension actually you know
that was absurd the low meeting because i when so once
thirty input nodes
i mean that's the kind of thing that maybe like the general consider like in taylor's like whatever the previous simulation each person maybe you're time i think a general paper about the approach here would probably be appropriate for
good to some point anyway
for having the lines i mean
but you can use an example of it looking at looking
i mean anyway they know it in the the ultimate in the basement thing when you're done that the know that we're talking about one that says request for location true or something like that right

my advisor you definitely the bald guy
that should be able to they should be able to come up with of part
just for the dog
all right you guys can continue talking about whatever you're talking about for
what the does not pretend the writing how i always think
that was had to write about submitting into a major
to write about submitting into a major international conference
ask you lines whatever white for whatever
structure and then over in your base that or whatever when a person says where is it you've already got you know since they were talking about admission in that you folks the idea of entering then when they go and ask where is it then you are enter notice already active because that's what

god bless america this maybe see the fireworks from your plane coming
but maybe one could do some learning
if you get the system to speak to itself you may find breakdowns in ours and you may be able to
and make it whereabouts maybe
yes and come up with the super religious all the values of the decision notes
which if we have and i drove medcenter so it's whatever the best of the most consistent answer artifact would give us be attention x. you know
questions i'll ask
is the question for this particular construction how we specify that's the information it provides

see that generation but making the system generate something this shouldn't be too hard
i've done generation and language production recent for full forty four and a half years and so it's
which is very large
that's nothing for those newer guys i mean they
and we pretend to parse it but
people sort of figure out or ask about that so this will be sort of document
and it has sort of fifty not yet specified interfaces
no not at all where it is located

maybe in and wondering i don't know what
does that for the art soldiers i was going to finish it before i got back
it hurts real bad
know lots of flying i got this from the two one two
lucky you i'm fact especially annex in over two weeks from now
and otherwise so you haven't missed much except for really
that's at least that
no he's not and that's the notion i would have people

you do the kind of we
no need to do it today or tomorrow or the next week
approach and he's coming back when next
might be more interesting to do something like that's so where rights we have fester
any they don't have attention spies fox guy they just
fox guy they just what i ski to
it's closer to six pages actually four thousand lines
i don't see and how we would be able to distinguish between the two intentions just from the other and so

twenty minutes ago thinking but i forget
god bless america this maybe see the fireworks
some surf nothing corps officer over the keys
it's going to tell us something
but it will assign values to all the nodes this yes and come
i what i'm afraid of is if we don't you know set up a situation was get a bunch of garbage out like that's whatever
is or thing that can be located

but is that it's mark i'm
i usually try writing papers it's not
writing papers it's not i don't regarded as painful
it depends on the it my gosh
i can't i'm listening today
know that probably know about the allman trees and
i mean we're talking about sort of anything that has the semantics everquest for location right actually

i was in i don't they don't want any they don't have attention
i'd don't quote me on this is the
i should mention that for you
on i know it's horrible song that should never been great
they whatever believe that this is no it's and they all contribute
we don't want to hard coat the set of axes or things that person's no serve food or the thirsty christmas tree
where's the zoo specify

for a certain way
out which is wanting to know where something is maybe in
all mean every paper has to be both
do just the small like introducing the
and since this never bad just document things
what's that supposed to be the only these things and he whether he's in a wheelchair on not

which means that we need to set up an intention inside of the system right
no that's i mean that's actually a problem it's different more like ten or something
a problem it's different it's more difficult to ride on four pitches to age like ten or something
i she would like to take it on tonnage so
grateful for us did we've discussed in terms of the either
so definitely have and it's you know it's here which is activated via the apology so

because i mean it i don't like papers we just talk about what you plan to do
i mean it's obvious that we can do any kind of beat education
grateful for us did in terms of the either
and they eternity tells us it has admission opening times that has admission
fees it has this it has that
so that and i was then and come up with the ecology side bits and pieces

other than that you know it's not a big deal
that have used any other but the news is we had you know i was visited by my german product manager
x. under different
it's not possible
so is the question i just i'm not what the is the

that have used any
you if you want you can have two pro asking each other
sub days that you know it was whether we would have a base that i think out but and in the input because of the construction
so that's took up everything weaned d. until that you get this about that and turkey what
but nevertheless for these are issues but we went we actually

and in houses of the generation days like nastiest thing
we wouldn't even have to kick started by giving it a certain attention or serving anything on the decision or
maybe we even in a position where we can take your report which is
report which is of course much better is to say how these excuses and much harder program
these excuses and much harder program

i remember there being some other ones went around but anyway
or whatever and this will forget us a bit closer henley stray
the twenty second tallest september and supper can germany
that's the people go to attend a performance
and the discourse can maybe of us what's more likely if we know what to look for in previous statements

more accused for us the good the weapons and it's not minute tomorrow afternoon
now two of the country are inside the construction based
so is this paper wouldn't particularly deal with that side although
what this is to expected what is the
and given that we know that the construction has these two things we can setup probabilities

bad it's time to walk the sheep
did you catch evolution to talk with she no
to talk with she is no
is presumably one of the watergate courts
anyways

what needs to be added to the system that's
base that if we don't have that's just we don't have any input from the language
so this was a nothing we could cry the but
we have a certain user second

that you're not going to you're going to get a variety of intentions out of that then i mean you're
right that's that's pretty big though
right that's big he no pretty big though
which probably most likely will be good enough

and that is exactly what would happen if we ask it to produce enough turns it would be
i just and whatever that maybe that would be to of what is the castle or what this
is going over my and the point is that you when someone's talking about a castle you know that it's the sort of thing that people are likely to want to go into
and then the discretion streak and how that's or no

right about what is on what's our take home message what are we actually
four thousand lines asking
of it at looking at that paper that you had i mean you know like you didn't really explain in detail what was going on an x. m. l. cases or whatever just as
i have taken care that we actually can do little interfaces too i thought modules that looked kind i went they the user likes these things and the only these things and he

maybe even that's maybe the time to introduce the new foreman isn't that you guys have cooked up
i if i got the funding so
so this will be sort of document and what we think and documenting work we have in terms of the basement
we should scheduled to do just maybe two moral afternoon is if everyone if around

we said it was four thousand lines i
lines i don't know what did
just is like really i don't know what did you look at it depends on the it my gosh
on the it my gosh i thought you were and i thought we were talking about something which was

you don't have to i mean the that you need to reduce it if it's a or reduce it's a kind of de niro
you don't have to i mean the conference maybe cogburn all mean every paper
small like introducing the formal as it might be not really possible and detail
creche and pretends we have sparse that and see

you know i mean just this it's sort of harder to learn to speak correctly in a foreign language learning to understand
we're in a week of business in germany i should mention
i'd never seen before other

the basic a gig as a be to give a lot of the system to have intentions because that's pretty
because that's what needs to be added to the system for it that's
you know that becomes part of like there's sort of current ongoing active conceptual structure and then

in the situation we have to set up a situation where you didn't know where something was and they wanted to go there
but look at it look i'll base that if we don't
you could even say this thing called the priors some surf nothing

but we can do randomized testing
i'm angle school everywhere
how do these pieces fit together

so this is just an idea sewing around and let's see what
and let's see what happens
and it's also difficulty even if you had a lot of substance it's hard to demonstrate that in four pages

nancy had said you don't know where they have a paper to write up until you write it up so
the series coming back we can run a band too so
what's your input

pages and i just don't know what you have in mind for expanding like
it's the whatever architecture is you know where
and from the construction of you know that it is the location is or thing

you can say we have done a little bit and that's
outside of it and
they do but even before that there's a student of arses doing a dialup crack recognition more trouble

i'm i didn't mean it but that's what you get for coming late
i'm i didn't mean it i'm but that's what you get for coming late to them you know
this is not very on target you're mike on that

which john we're talking about this and that's a paper that we made just
which john i mentioned to me
and i just sort of brought forth the idea that we take a sentence whereas the part of power

not including figures and such reason i don't know
i mean isn't it about fifty five sixty lines do they
how many characters me on this is the numbers i have from looking goal

we have to put this in the paper
so we have tons of little things here and
i don't that's how it fit nicely with the paper

in the moment it's the base
because that's what the person is thinking about i mean that's the sort of
i mean that's the sort of cognitive linguistic anyway and probably not

where up rent per person
lots of people go to the opera to take pictures of it and to look at it that's the people go
of it and to look at it that's the people go

both sides right you don't need
observed when you heard the speaker say where's x. or when that first
so the little circle you have by the d. is it

internal alarms
that it has and then they're trying to wrote at us

two weeks from today
i mean that actually i'm on one from your perspective and one from or a private for

grandparents and then i'm saying to drive and it's true grow to more
and we write about it

a sicily
pick up my son

from the bit basic the same ideas having to just computers dickinson
would maybe some thinking to do weird and strange

and be if you look at all the factors we would never observe people that say in wheelchairs under you know under all conditions you know
basis it seems to me that

whereabouts maybe learn new things
so there's no and of potential things one could get out of it if that works

what's the system understand things
things no problem

just the fact that what gets the point
and so whatever that is the generic d. falls intention that it would find out which

it's just the fact that what gets the point is that getting to understand one construction doesn't mean they won't always know exactly when it's correct use that
i think it be fun to look at it or into that question it's a pretty strange

out like everything's exactly thirty percent
so what we actually they need to do is into the script that changes all this i things you know

meeting because i when looked at it because i was
looked at it because i was thinking they could not be right and they would

it's just thing point is that given all of these different factors
us did you think people

i'll ask you about the ebay is and she's working on that always
because i mean it is time and nancy had said you don't know

working on that always need generation x. smell
i'm going to work on that today and tomorrow no need

i'm going to finish it today i hopefully or
when to do one of those things where i stay here today

it's mark i'm i've been looking into it i said it's not
it i said it's not like it's a blank slate i got everything i

we'll see next week
got come you know like your studio that horrible

i will try to work on this mark and
if i can finish it today help you with that tomorrow if you work

here's an idea right that's what that paper was
here's a here's one possible thing you could do

basis committee science conference is
it's sort of cockatoo snore side cold english linguistic

had been harassed you good
you will suffer and so you backwards

diagram somewhere we're still of
see the another plus things or something like that and you go

there's this conference that's a seventh already international conference on nor all the cognitive the much invaded architecture's of natural language processing
keynote speakers are come aside like

both learning and like comprehension production cycle you
you can look at the web site

can look at the web site
and they had and the deadline is a fifty they're doing

we've got over a week
it would be to right two papers actually i'm on

having i also think that if we sort of right about what three have done in the past six months we could sort of craft knife the paper that if it gets rejected which could doesn't hurt it's something
good thing it's a exercises

you know the details of how to do it or what did you do it or what would one possibly put in central
what would be what's what to write them out

part two ready for that
but we can tell them what we think i mean it's

how many but that are in the process
how many pages that they need to finish on those it's just like four in the process

four pages so it's a little paid it's not even
we said it was four thousand lines i

no that's i mean that's actually a problem it's different it's more difficult to ride talking about something which was more like ten or something
i do remember you talking every talking to me just that what you said

i mean it's still i was maybe it's just plus
i mean it's still i was maybe it's just plus i was in i don't

very specific unfortunate
it's closer to six just

you have a link
like he just comfortable with us calling keith

very teacher
know lots of flying i got this from the two one two

that is something for the rest of the gang could too the thing with the goats and the helicopters
change the watch bad it's time

don't make any plans for spring break next year
think you're going to do run into you'll worry internal workshop incessantly

i mean we're going to have an example case
maybe have it would be right and the point is to like this where is the case

but then in the end we're not doing like those things right it's right into the technical
would that be clear the people or not

that would take it would i
would be like this is the idea i it would i made around and there's a paper that i have we consider

i didn't get that today we consider say this is
it see this if you're not around interim for taking the discussions and you don't get any vivid

so super thing done right
like chicken done so we could say this what sort of state of the art today and say

i four pages you could
you could definitely possible to do

that was related to we were talking about
introduces a pseudo square

i know it's horrible i've liked every never been great and
so that we can say we always just look at this site turns that's

also just talking about suicide and that's
prodigy and dynamic to them to come

young any it sounds too iraq in for that anyway
rather than the other parts ability which is that all through discourse as they talk about different things you know like what

so that's not like context discourse is all things linguistics
so what would be kind of this that if we encounter concepts that are catholic bank banquet tell we run it so they were taught edgy and they eternity tells

so it's not just the particular words so you're ebor says hey
so you're looking for a few keys that you know work used to very few specific used to some intention begin endemic

want to go into or is it the fact that if there's an admission fees and one of the things we know about admission fees is that you pay them in order to go in and then the idea
that's the only i trance we can do

and then it's up for us to decide what to do with it
so we may think that where's the theater whether or not he has talked about tickets before then we he's probably want to go there too see something

that wonderful from mozart or for the but
the smarter way is true groovy at the on prodigy and dynamic

way so of course we have to keep memory of what's the last intention and
intention and how does it fit to this and but doesn't tell us in terms of the one we're examining

but we went we actually decided last week is too is good for your benefit was too pretend we have observed pirates not too in such as where is the product or
just swears x.

like three new sort of had parse hand
but this is what we hope to be able to observe in general for my princess and from one prodigies

so the difference of whereas the river station versus bird where is clean and
assistance

that's exactly what they're looking for
that's exactly what they're looking for

how i forgot what eating

scratch other brain brains of

internal

i'll be off too sicily in germany for a couple three days

what do you what are you doing i forgot

i'm flying to sicily visioned each couple of simon this grandparents and

fasten which is the meeting of all the marge we're responsible people and smart come

and represent i see i

that's the actual reason

and then i'm also growing up to you mel for a day and then i'm going

great time to be coming back to the u. s. to pay

i'm all the people at the airport would be happy to work on that day

and then even better service than usual

did you get it's it be a problem but

we sit around and we talked and he came

talked and he came up we came up pretty strange idea

and that's all around they on your

and maybe it might be ultimately the most interesting thing for you but because

because she has been known to complain about the fact that the we do here is not really enough

k. e. and make you happy

imagine if you will that we have a system that does all that understanding that we wanted to do based on occurrences

it should be possible to make that system produce questions

if you have the knowledge of how to interpret where is x. under different conditions situational user discourse and untouchable conditions you should also be able to make the same system ask where is x.

intentions

but like in they didn't i do that take and in houses of

you except the snacks a little bit more of us gets a friend in computers

conditions you know when they say it x. and there is a riot at the gold and the parking is good we can never contacted

and he would like to actually work on that

they probably should be coming back a year from now

i just don't think i think there are probably a year away from getting this and understand things

you're right it's not the same as the understanding

it's in some ways easier in some ways harder

it's a pretty strange here and

the basic a gig here and so that's pretty

what it would be the prior intention

no real it's we have to dress in some top dawn processing given certain

unless it was in the situation we have to it

unless it was in the situation we have to

which is i don't know where something is and i need to go there

do we really need to do that

it's i know it's strange but

if you just ask what is it like you know it off that person wanting to enter some something it'll give you an answer

out of that then i mean you're just talking about like given this user what's this what is it what is the use are most likely to want to do

you can do serve some user in contact and that's what's the exterior probabilities of on the session notes

you can do serve some user in contact

i what i'm afraid of is if we don't or what this that's whatever

you know call goes through all the permutations which is we did it

thirty input nodes

but if we do it because it twenty times and that's a very large number

so is it comes of twenty billion or something

it's just thing it's anyway the point is that given all of these different factors that see it's still going to be impossible to run through all of the possible situations or whatever and this

iverson hours and hours here

so it's it's an idea that one could for something run past

jared you're in the group cherry

and what other news

what other news too

we pick some more things from the smart from system but

from system but that's not for the general and

here today if i go home i can finish it i've tried

it i've tried about five times so far right working for a while and i like i'm hungry

that are i think i i can work at home and i try to

at home and i try to work around but i fail miserably

like i ended up the place last night

i got everything i need is a and i

i think we'll see definitely on tuesday for the heard know it to me when next

heard know it to me on thursday

i don't have a problem with those working on it though

so you would say it's funky

moods i mean it wouldn't hurt to write up the paper because i mean

i don't have much experience with conference favors for compete in the computer science realm and so when i look at

realm and so when i look at what you had which was a complete submission as i said

it like this is the sort of the basic outline in the system or whatever

expanding like i what i didn't do is go to the website of the conference in like

but all it for the sake of doing computer science

so it's sort of scorpio too if cycles cycle neural plausible thee much of a toots architecture so that's remember first thing

it seems pretty interdisciplinary and i mean read

and i mean read the keynote speakers come i said right

the question is what quickly actually do and keep a straight face was doing it

i really can't keep a straight face saying anything i

that and we're sort of dresses position paper we went all to do that

we went all to do that which is not

rights we have fester calls that they didn't lose nevada chrissie and

say let's just talk about this and how we

it but pretend to understand it and we

what the does not pretend about how i always think

many quitting whiny we need winnie

maybe i want to go why maybe you want to write something too

maybe i want to go why write something too

is it normally like dialogue systems or you know other an l. p. s. thing no no it's

or you know other an l. p. s. thing cognitive no no it's like

and we should all do more for publication this

germany

germany i see some of the old reenter

see some of the old reenter

so is what are you talking about you know the details of how to do it or what did you do it or what would be what to write them what would one possibly put in central

done this and i wear whatever percentage better than everybody else you know

fox guy they just what i ski to

not whatever white for whatever reason i don't know

how many characters are on line looking goal

look at the web page

the good the weapons and it's not minute tomorrow

you have a link john overload and

he's you decided

keith you decided i'm chilling in the five one

except for really weird idea

the idea that you but you're here but that

the idea that you and i already about

of the gang could too the thing with the goats and the helicopters

i that's great got the funding so

i mean you'll get you'll fly is there

not too keen

there's a kiwi

coconut too easy

easy

i trying to find something that he didn't growing as far but coke

as far but coke another that pineapple that's true

cantaloupe pay is so but we have to decide what like sort of the general idea

maybe have it would be kind of the paper had would have and my vision and i so if we could say we curious is @reject@ his person if you wanted to work right here is the case

here is understanding you to do rights and

but then in the to do rights and you know without going into the technical

interim for taking the discussions and you don't get any vivid

so super thing done right like chicken done so we could say this what

i never can say what we do this

pressing done right interpretation done right example

and how much you get into the cognitive neural part

that's the only that's the push right that you need to reduce it

like and nobody cognitive now and you can just point to the two of the country are

like and nobody cognitive now and you can just point to the two of the country are

deal with that side although i could reference they entail it's sort of like approach it

the fact that the method hero compatible with are designed to be compatible with whatever no logical narrow her bio

but you can use an example of it looking at looking

cases or whatever just as you know here's the general idea some gets

idea some gets put in there

it would be like using the formal is rather hopefully you can say something like constituents tells you what the construction is made out of you know without going into this intense detail

the construction is made out of you know without going

it would be like using the formal is rather than you know introducing a person into this intense detail give given

a person give given the one paragraph whirlwinded or what this is for

you're probably wouldn't be part of it maybe once

hey might get you may ruin your career forever if

hey might get blacklisted if

we actually have we made any progress on what they decide that last week i'm you

week i'm you read the transcript of me sneezing so this is your opted

this is your opted to cut we decided

a break came in and i said sparse that and see what we could possibly hope to surf on the disperse sites

a break came in and i said asking you about how we were sort of going to sort out thee decision nodes hope to surf on the disperse sites

where it like we need this or in my opinion is that it based another sub days that

because of the construction is going to be in the days that

and outside

that was that the question was that what

this is my only constraint the

my this little square in that situation user this chorus right apology i saw the diagramming

in that i saw the diagramming

my god that's amazing

so going to start making phil collins jokes

come on that horrible song that should

come on i know it's horrible i've liked every that horrible song that should never been great and

i've liked every aspect of so called and

i'm i've liked every aspect of so called out of my mind and

i'm i haven't out of my mind

no he's not i would have people

i don't really listen to it i was too

so the in some sometime inside and

that's excluding me

i can't believe that's never been thought of before we

i don't remember what the doctor those are little bugs

doctor those are little bugs

they whatever believe that this is no it's and they

it was the middle thing this is no it's and they all contribute to these things down here

it was the middle thing things down here it's

i mean eighty or the l. you'll that's

what's that supposed to be the international sign for interface not

never seen before other

no this is vaguely obscene fast

no this is i meet caught by agents design i don't know

great there's maybe a different so what

great there's maybe a different so what

a different so what are these letters again you're is

there situation user on prodigy again you're is situation user discourse and

there situation user on prodigy situation user discourse and

so that's not like context discourse is all things linguistics

interesting so this big it would speed the current offerings plus all the previous entrances

and for of as he even had greeted beach just going to be here is end of july she's

end of july she's new linguist working for you know and

know and what she would like to do for example is grateful i she would

they come back at the eve baxter and

and so know coming up with the idea that if the person discussed the discuss the admission fee in previous the that might be a good indication that how do i get to the castle actually he wants to answer

discussing there's a few of the previous entrance is a good indication

times that has admission fees it has

and then we make it as far as mexico and look up and then

up and then search dynamic the scooby discourse is story four occurrences of these things in a different window awful for instance

and that might you know give us additional input to belief a versus b.

so it's not just the particular or ebor says hey

then grip since this since

and then the idea of entering is active in the discourse or something and then

even more general the idea is to say we certain conquer certain tea and i turns so that's

and docile grow roads it has what

it has what pirates whatever it has functions

and then we look in the discourse whether any of that or any so if structure corresponding to these road function has ever or kurds

and so we can hard cold fall probably look for tickets there took for this there for that wonderful

but you're still doing look up so that when the person so the point is that when the person says where is it then you sort of say let's go back and look at other things and then decide

prior to the where is the question they say you know how much does it cost to getting you know to see a movie around here

is the closest here the

here the point is that by mentioning admission fees that just sort of stays active now you know

i think that's the correct way so of course

how do these and much harder to program

specify what we think b. z. output observe it and put notes for all basis for that except d. for the discourse it's should be

and they reconsider if fiddling with these things to see what it actually produces in terms of output

we need to find out what the where is x. construction would give us in terms of semantics and

just semantics and inspect

or any variance of that

look at it this way

decided instead of there the proper typical wary sacks where know we don't really know that you want to go there or just want to know where it is so the difference we were

but that videotape figure this or

actually more the other way around we want it

we want it something that represents what in terms of going there are just wanted to know where it is or something

this is perfect to big the hard of d. where it's something question surface structure

which can deep you know should be maps tool something that activates forthcoming

and so you know before we don't recurring get through the basement i mean we wouldn't

if this is amaze it's just a reconstruction we haven't noting that right and we

and we turn on that no what

it's final tables or for those it should be

it's a assume we called something like i lock x. know it in the past acts know note and

what we actually get if we just look at the discourse larry's tax should activate or should

creepy both whereas

both whereas february saxon ted we find from the data is always just ask asking the person wants to know where it is

we want to sort of come up with blocked gets input and how to in case of a where it's question

so what the outcome of you know punctured look like

and what other discourse information from the with history could we hope to get squeeze other that the

so define d. input into the base that based on what the i've friends where is ex there's us

apology so wary sacks produces something that this is stand for that's kind of so banks restroom probably whatever and then

where it is located we have user proximity note years somewhere

note years somewhere which tells us

which tells us how far the user how far away the users respect respected that into t.

so you're talking about friends since the construction involve this entity refers reverses entity

intelligence is this thing has a location swat

or ask for both

sides right you don't need to even do that it's

observed even do that it's just sort of what would be observed in that case
