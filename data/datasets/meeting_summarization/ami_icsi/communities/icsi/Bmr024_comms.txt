so naming conventions and things like that and i've been trying to keep actually up-to-date
we can ignore it when we get it back or we could tell them
we have a whole bunch of digits if
know i mean she's going through doing these kinds of checks and i've
just you know east you scroll from screen to screen looking for blips
and my tendency right now is if i b. m. comes back with this meeting in the transcript is good slip and do it
euphemistic it but i mean maybe there's a serious problem what
would be a problem from mine the beats are pre recorded
it will it be preceded by i'm reading transcript and so yes
does all the work for you know you just give to tie mark of words in the computer that it does all the work for you
does all the work for you that it does all the work for you
you it does all the work for you
there's a little bit better that won't be perfect alignment aren't perfect but
like that and interested to know that what with you retrain
is not a machine at the beginning actually the reader this i don't know who came up with
of course they don't know that it's the same person both times so we collect recollect both human computer
mean anybody who's training something up could choose to put it you include this or not i would not say
you know it's in your just speech stayed a. m. r. and we just have a directory called like other
do we have american born folk reading german played place names and so forth so exactly
it's really the backup issue rather than the file server the thing i think there's an argument for having you know you can use our old file servers for this that have day that is very rarely access and then have
test before are and all to die just before like that randy right
a while and i was just doing minus our star not realizing that it to be read backed up
with me no because this is maybe something that we can do without involving dave and how about we buy
we should probably make that part of the procedure for recording the meetings that's what i'm wondering is
paper about so you just sit down at your computer you type of command so it's just but then
just here they approach
future so there must be some something else
they language the scaling acoustic scaling
i'm actually re optimize and

chuck came up here and recorded some it himself speaking some digits
one interesting note is a problem i don't know if this is just
i don't know if this is just because of how i play back i say as cindy playing in the file every
that and don't bother actually computing that it writing down the digits
but let's talk about it because
about it because that's something that i know and dresses less interested in them so
and i haven't heard back so
your time has a preprocessing step right
would we do better
a serious problem what will they do when they go here beep seven three five two i mean you
and so i don't think it would be a problem let's
to do but i don't think it doesn't match anything we've described about meetings
is everything that we talked about them doing at u. w. and so forth really does actually talk so what does that
are pretty soon we're about half halfway through our desk right now that was going to our concerns
those were in non backed up no and that kind of right
non backed up no and that kind of right
so i mean pretty much and having the disc we can get it the right they were
it's probably getting of doing that is busy little utility that
to do after you confirmed that it's really backed up
it looks like that would still be some difference maybe
i mean as we saw was the meeting we could probably the pruning without really so we
but you're only talking about so we we have a very open
you're only talking about a percent or two right

i b. m. we sort of spot check that
but with this new format that hopefully they're not hearing that and if they are it shouldn't throw them
are we having them but are we having seventh grade eight seventy eight three two
but are we having them do digits two yes because
and i don't think it's possible really to do this full time but that would shows is motivation to do as many hours as possible director crackers
is the most unpleasant and correcting
different you can't just hold is if it's i mean did you two different
it's i mean did you two different too right but might don't be potentially
i don't i wouldn't in and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction rather than another type of interaction
and just have a marking
you can use whatever procedure want it's convenient for you all saying if we it any other way that means that we need a separate procedure and someone has to do that
you can use whatever procedure want it's if we it any other way that means that we need a separate procedure and someone has to do that
only source they have them on disk and
time ago and they're still all fine i both i've burn them where they burned were they pressed
both i've burn them and they're still i
we can already put them on tape
and the tape is high is very reliable
how about we buy one of these high density tape drives and we put
the p. o. p. futures we use that triangular filters had some so

had a not a small number only
number only a subset of that has been transcribed and so we need to decide
so i was just wondering what people thought about how automated can we make the process of finding where the people read the digits doing the forced alignment and doing the timing
so what do all of them that if we have someone who was doing acoustic studies it's to have the same for every recording
so what is the purpose of this recording
anything we did we weren't supposed to collect any data is at all
so that's what the question
no that's not a problem i look it
my intention that was my and then later on some people will consider the meaning and some people on and
before that the c. d. is an alternative just before they were before because goes bad it right
there can't no but this bomb welsh there shouldn't be an over fitting if you're really
if you if you marry some years ago bill burned to the thing where he was looking at that and he said that you on across validation and
was he's it looks like the probability once we just look at the probabilities he was getting the likelihood was getting out of kill peeve snuck up some they look pretty different in there
or something so it's not just losing some frequency range exactly so it's not i don't think the filter shape by itself or make

i'll come make can make a comparison to fulfill to some to this new one and just to see if
one and just to see if by doing nothing and the molly just having that training to what happens
another one that we had items gender that definitely dog too was talking about spark come
andy purple and they smart come grouper collecting some dialogues
they have one person sitting in here looking at a picture and wizard sitting in another room somewhere
and they're doing i travel task
i don't know who came up with it but i think they're really clever idea we
i mean i think was registered for is someone said this not reliable way to do it but the
another thing i mean that said sri recognition experience
and i'm i don't talk do you have any updates
and i'm successfully increasing air raid
that was on males because at that meeting before you said we got now to where they're was tend to upset right that was before i tried

smart i'm also and grass
so i mean i think they'll be inches be interested in all this but
gets on for a second there's some distance or something pickups
as long as they have one number and they know that there's only one beep maximum goes a pet right the only
the precipitation because there are huge places where there's just no activity at all
i'm not saying it should be one or the other but it's like they're couple different
that i have to and one of them is what about consent issues and the
and the other one is what about transcription or inscriptions
or so we don't inscriptions type of music
and we put the date actually i'm not backed up and

also checking through and my and monitoring be transcription of another transcriber you
is motivation to do as many hours director crackers
and that'll be something like it's interesting once in a while to back i see you mean a back channel or
qualities so good so they can scrolling through that pretty quick
and lives and then dress actually they're not here but they did say a one point that they thought they could do pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment
yes this is what was so do they actually saves the far field did it because at first they were
i bet that sounds good list it's pretty funny
heidelberg so
is in this area true and very conservatively i mean
couple times are percent or something so it's not just exactly so

actually talk so what does that mean for how we are unorganized things
you can again as i think and it's just saying if you want to use the same tools of the same conventions is no problem with that is
no problem with that is just that it's you know different directory it's called something different it's you know is
too right but those are folded and it's just you just mark might don't be potentially confusing
and it's just you just mark the transcripts differently so one option
was not reliable they wear out
or they're on c. d. but they're not that's not the only source they have like
decades i think that so how about putting them on that plus like on the on that or something and
i would think just use tape regardless one thing i don't understand is if you have the day that if you if the meeting that is put on this exact you want and it's backed up once in the backup system should never have to bother with it and more
i think that it's at least the ones the that you put it on it would but we still have enough changed that the nightly backups are starting to take too long it has nothing to do with up again so then it so

i think the most important thing is morgan wanted to talk about europe a demo
being transcription
i mean i think truck was the one who has at the age and i'm going to really have anything to say
but it's probably still better to have all this extra data
what they eat or it's just that
we've never signed or it's just that hour they i would trip collecting here
actually you know we could do that just with and we do our own back up once and for alcohol and then and we don't have to about this girl
and what's the filters had some so the india so i find amusing trip a little ones

file but i recommend that too that's interesting
we didn't cut those out not we don't we didn't in order
not try to catch it so didn't in order to cut them i would have to
useful and you know and then once in a while they'll have to refer to the other channels square something up
up and they're rare events but you can really go through a meeting very quickly just you just
but the same time we're benefiting tremendously for the precipitation because
and it's like he works but it's really small difference so
right so the other the losing some frequency range it's not i don't think the filter shape by itself or make

we got that sorted out i'm how're doing
and then it goes to a real was there and they're evaluating then they wanted
right to your point is like it's good one that we could just get more disk and put it there i'm an ex
of command but then you're effectively using the resources of the backup system
i'm rehearsed so we had reached the point where
and plus the vocal track victimization didn't actually make things worse so something's
but now you're looking over a larger range and may not be so fine
and that actually help

to you know bridger stimulate the computer breakdown halfway through the session and so then after that the person's told that they're not talking to
it there that's not a bad idea i'm an ex h. x. whatever printers
that my intention is to do a script it'll do everything mean you have to physically
so i don't think he's actually lost it it's definitely no problem all right
what about if the times overlap with the normal backup time
it's just it's just a utility which queues up
it just cues it up and when it's available copy it and then
integration and that we're making that low and high actually there is a difference in that suffer

we just ended i b. m. we sort of spot
but the point is that we want to get a set of clean digits
think so it's pretty distinct the beats
right so because it's two people and they're not face to face
we've never signed anything that said that we couldn't use anything we did collecting here we weren't supposed to collect any data
no we have what we don't we have our own something with it that their back on schedule
own something with it that doesn't that isn't used by the backup gang and

files and directory reorganization status
files and directory files and directors
so it's wizard in the sand usual sense that the person who is asking questions doesn't know that it's a machine is not a machine at the beginning actually
setup it's kind of different groups it's an area based it's human computer interface it's really pretty different but i have no
but i have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they're going to do but i don't think
i don't talk do you have

phrase and that seems pretty good i think
there was a false alarm so
there was a false alarm so
it was just something to do no the question is do we saved one or two
you're talking about back to i'm much more concerned about
here we were saying that would there's jesus but this is difference here

so i took so for their or their difference
so why not but i took so for their usage they don't need anything right
year i mean the c. d.'s are every time it was a kind of going to die like
test i mean the c. d.'s are and all a kind of going to die like that randy
i got confused but there's also because at that
i mean is this that of almost training or

we're about half that was going to our concerns
we only half i thought were more than with a
were more than with a little more than that because we're using up some space that we shouldn't be on
so once everything gets converted over to the just were supposed to be using will be probably seventy five percent
extra if you have to put the data on and on like this to begin with
but you can have it n. w. archive too you can have a non backed up disk n. w. archives right otherwise you don't

i mean going to really have anything to say of and we still haven't done it so
a good core group the
i see no reason not to do all of them that all of them
it's i don't see why not meeting corp should let it be it
let's just say that men are simple

and i have some web pages on more of the background
a reason that's one of the reasons that we were talking about this and
about this and those and the sounds like it's more of an experimental setup it's kind of different groups it's an area based it's
so one option is you folded in and just
that we're making that low and high actually there is a difference in that suffer the p. o. p. futures

and i think that we're going to end up with better coverage of the back channels
where does this maybe we can have some very the microphone stew or their difference
it was a quicker once so when so i had
it was a quicker once i had
that so the one thing that i then tried was to put in the low pass filter which we have so most

and again i don't think we'll be able to do with that alone because sometimes people correct themselves and things like that
actually i had a question that if you find
of course they don't know that it's the same person both times so we collect recollect both human computer and humans human that are essentially
but the but let's suppose just for a second that we sort of taking out a lot of the major difference is because until doing already sort of
doing already sort of using email scale and using the same style filter integration and

you know it's in your just speech stayed a. m. r. and we just have a directory called like other
i mean i don't care what the it under right and
i mean i don't care what the it under right i mean that's just a my preference and just start there
i mean that's just a my preference is to have a single procedure so that i don't have to think too much about things and just start there and
and similarly we're not going to tell them to someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings

and then i wanted to talk about but as i said i we may not have time what we should do about they just we have a whole pilot
which are now being attitude by my head transcriber in terms of spelling errors and all that she's also checking through
agenda list you had something from you about segment rationed class for tradition
abby pretty good

so twenty hours but i the other thing is that that's kind of twenty hours a sad because the longer before the demo we actually have twenty hours more time to be for people to actually do things with it
so this party to inform everybody and of course to get input
no it's all paper about so you just sit so it's just
you can do vocal track determination on the test they only or almost the training in the test

we can handle this the type of problem we have here
especially when you get some time constraints for the references and for the habits or something
i'm so it's not a meeting right
it has nothing to do with the media it's just it so then that's

reading right don't hurt him too much unless you scratch them but and read
but it though right once and the reason rights don't last
it has nothing to do with the media it's just so then it so then that's
what you had this habit this conversation with dave johnson that rather than with me i identity no because this is

and then given that's listen endurance are going to be ten fifteen minutes late and try to figure out what we can to most effectively without them here so so
absent which is the multi processor unix linux
i think it was an andres wants talk about segment patient and recognition

i b. m. transcription status
and my attitude was yes because there might be people who are using this corpus for acoustics as opposed to adjust for language i'm
also for dialogue of various sorts

maybe i said new we said this before just that we met and we talked about it and
was looking through log files and the likelihood are
that's if you have some threshold somewhere in terms of being search or something

and i've been trying with you do you w. folks also
showing them sharing them sharing them with you w. folks
and so desperate for one maybe we should talk about the i've been transcription status someone can

in the file every once in a while like a beep sounds like it's cut into two beats it's a two pieces
two beats and it's a two pieces
and i don't know if that's a artifact of playback i don't

we can ignore it when we get it back or we could tell them if you hear someone reading a digit string just say a digit bracket and don't bother actually
heard back so i hope you got it how pleased maybe he's
gone i don't know he didn't even reply to my message so

do you have anything else to say about transcription about i.
brian about i. b. and
brian i said rest sent brian a message about the meeting and i haven't b. and

up i realize that we were using the preset rented version and
once in a while to back channel sometimes or
channel sometimes it seems to be similar to the ones you're being picked up and

see but i don't think it's going to be a problem
i think that is if they are in fact going to transcribe these things certainly any process would have to correct them or whatever's used to be much less elaborate for digits or other so we're not right
this is too because could stick language english system it's to be training to training that and development data for the smart come with them

just what we do with digits we have so many
training and how do you determine one to stop it or
although that haven't shown to make a big difference

then they wanted to use this equipment and so that would question came up as here's some more
is cheap i mean if we need to we can buy a disc hanging office workstation it's not backed
so i mean it's not backed up the system in stone care too much

to you know bridger
yet and so then separate out whether it's beginning are and kind of affects but
i have to go now you can talk to the computer

if you tell them that they're the computer part is running on a windows machine and
and the whole breakdown thing kind of makes sense
of makes sense part

i think the idea of two more people conversing with one another ski conversations is that part of the meeting corpus
this has two or more people conversing with each other just not face to what if we just give
know it doesn't dry each other just not face to face what if we just give that i mean

to worry about formats that's that's another argument to keep it separate because it's going
probably i didn't realize that's it separate because it's going to follow these smart com transcription conventions and not the dixie meeting so
i'll caps and does it by just computing in the lower tester coefficients

is cheap i mean
which is near saturation
we have also go if you go but we have like thirty you know from ten years no ten have

the but they wear out just from sitting on the shelf or
then you would think you'd hear much more clamoring about
would be is a system that re burned the c. d.'s every year every time it was

they'll these all the l. d. c. distribution you know the most for
so the only issue is then if we need access to
regardless first bother with it and more

it and then you can tell it to then remove it from the desk or you can go do it at a few days later whatever you want to do after you confirmed
if you did that during the day would never make it to the nightly backups and archive that's what it is right
futures you know if that's also different in the same direction or not

time suddenly also the vocal track accommodation only in the tests on the test data so
you're expected to help a little bit if you do it on the tests and more if you do it on both training and
in the past and then will have hopefully better though so but this

one's triangular one strap it's thirty seven hundred and sixty hurt
one's triangular one strap is a little so hundred and sixty hurt
before it is it great deal p. of strep is always also but then we had a slight

why don't you can start off with
i think the that it's certainly i think there's a recognition we want to maybe focus eminent andrea sincere since i was tickling his and also the smoke them

we want to talk about if we want to add the dated to the mark meeting recorder corpus
they would create collecting here

an update on sri recognition experiment's
and so i went i swear i tried the trap trying triangular one

just but look like we were pretty full so i can till next week
says so there's some in adams agenda list you had

absence i think also he should've have been involved in one of those things at least it'd probably
so that's fine but if we don't need access to

this meeting we have a little more to discuss
so the time it was last time is that there were errors in the transcripts where they put beeps where there weren't any hour and they put in extraneous beeps and

but some i think they'll have an easier time keeping track of where they are in the file
and that's the crucial part and right

but some of them do automatic the conditions and we did with the automatic
segment asian and i don't think we need we look at it in detail we just ended i

and we'll just have to see what we get back from them
the main thing would be if we can align what they give us with what we sent them

and i think we'll be able to do that with this new beeped format right
i think it's also they are much less likely to do have errors

listen to it and we wanted to avoid doing that so we they are transcribing
intention so it's part of the reason that i wanted to bring this up is probably just give it a title

and i've prepared a set of five which i'm calling set to which are now
goal is package twenty hours right now and once that's done move on to the next

and you indicated to me that we have a goal now for it for the be dark the demo of twenty hours so
i mean you think so it's pretty distinct the beats

good i'm hiring people who
really are they would like to do it full time several these people

and you know i've oil will expect that they'll have to move sometime bins and do some corrections
and you know i've also the discovered so with the new

at a time and that sort of is useful and you
they're going to have macro sprints hurting the beat marks

version and the pre segmented version is extremely useful
and wouldn't it be useful also to have the visual representation of those segments and

and it's just amazingly helpful because what happens
but that's should be saying that but you can just since the back i'm so every night you can recycle the back that the

so i think that's going to also you know the c. d. efficiency of this part of the process
my understanding is the issue isn't and then have a fast you pop server for they of that us heavily

be one thing about just actually doing recognition
one and then you got your tape out but otherwise

the winter i'm not quite i'm talking about i mean i
i mean what time it just now and

it just now and so there's a bunch of that hasn't been marked yet and
and there's the issue that they we know what was said but do we because people it's not an option it

if we could really get one percent on
we should be able to write i i if we segmented it we can get one percent on digits

anyway and unless we tell them different they're going to transcribe it
or we could try some automated methods

that's it you race appoint kind of euphemistic it but
if one meeting so there's a little bit better that won't be perfect

we want to have him digits we have so many of them that would be to actually do something with them
there can't be be an over fitting if you're really

in you're mike is a little over there
all right so let's make we do the ones that says so there's

in berkeley over there
like they tell about

so it we just and we use that actually and have five to do the scoring
so what been using so far with us a simplified version of

maybe the started your speech in the end of it or
so rob pours elena that personal

all that two i wanted to use the year recognize alignment to train up it's it's a factor
@reject@ too if you tell them that they're no

i think eight meetings or something which i'm using
i'm using before it was twenty minutes if one meeting so

of if that is there some contract with some upcoming something about that they what they eat
and occasionally you might need to retrace one and

a problem i look it seems to me that if we're doing it anyway and we're doing it for these purposes that we have these distant mike's we definitely should or should save it all as long as we got to space and
as we got to space and discuss pretty cheap such

not i would not say was part of the meetings corpus citizen
know it doesn't dry it has each other just not face to face and that was what if we just give that i mean like we give these meetings a name

another day we have and if somebody doing experiment once strain up including that then they can right
so it i it dick begs the question of what is the meaning corpus so

so it in a special case it and if we were going to special case it who's going to do that it
i think so it in who's going to do that it makes sense to handle it with the same infrastructure since we don't want to duplicate things unnecessarily but as far

too right but those are folded and it's just you just mark might don't be potentially confusing
on the i original probably be three or four years

probably i didn't realize that's meeting so
when i was looking for space for two i found one disk that had i think it was nine gigs in another one had seventeen

abby pretty good disc might eventually be an issue so we might need to get some more just pretty soon we're about you want to be a subject
i see forever they've been fighting even those degrade but

but that's that's risky
they burn new ones every once in a while but if you but you know we

i think the file server could become an issue as we get a whole bunch more new compute machines and we've got
and we've got you know fifty machines trying to access data off of that but that one all right for now because the

right for now because the network so slow
no reading from being read and read

i was the one who said it was not reliable they or something
but then we had a slight difference in in the scale

so you don't want to put ear on reproduce herbal data on them
after what amount of time year or

i mean all the l. i don't know many people who do it
i mean all the l. i don't know many people who do it on c. d.

just here i'm long time ago that depressed ones years ago ninety one and they're still all fine i both i've burn them and they're still i mean usually they're where they burned were they pressed
time ago and they're still all fine i where they burned were they pressed

that depressed ones last for while not mean usually they're
i so archive angle just use tape one

but the burdens ones i mean when i say
i mean when i say two or three years i'm saying is that i have had disks which are gone in a year

just archive it on the tape and then but in see these
you're just saying put them on c. d.'s for normal access i mean

that the c. d. is an alternative to tape it bad it
to tape it he already has a perfectly good tape system it's more reliable

first of all there was a problem with thee archive in that i was every once in a while doing that you mod on all the directors emperor cursive to mangione because
because they weren't getting set correctly every once in a while and i was just doing

but we still have enough changed that the nightly backups are starting to take too long up again
what you had this habit what if we buy what the they called these i identity

i don't know but it's an automatic robots was very convenient the opposite
the one we have to i you just run a program to restore them but

so who's going to do these back backups the people
these back backups the people that collect it

and it will never show up on the nightly backups right and then it never right which
it in with i think we just with keeping on the safe side but

so i mean will probably want to convert all those files file systems and on back that media
i'm rehearsed where

so i mean i'm just playing with the number of calcium that we use and the recognize or and you have to say you
and yes i'm using you have to say you have to tell people that you're doing you're trying the tendon teachers

the where the problem women on nothing our trouble right
the where the problem nothing our trouble right

i mean we don't this is i'm just no actually there's more training that
this is i'm just digits that

so most i'm five systems actually bands that it's about thirty seven hundred hurts although you
although you know movie the child goes to for thousand right

but that's beside the point we're looking at the discrepancy
i'm say in each case how do you determine you know the usual fudge factors they

or almost it's almost training
or maybe using one too many i mean it's you know

actually we just do fixed number of iterations
in this case for

at that and he said that you could get him
do that's the easy went to tech because we save

since current duffy cock program doesn't allow me to change the filter shape independently of the scale
i did the experiment on guests arrive friends and where i tried to where the standard is to be used couples of the filters you

somewhere is my agenda

i think we want it to start off with you down to

them here so one thing is talk about them all so

smart

smart calm

what are we talking here

right that not come to that so why we have that on the age and then we'll get to it and talk about it

reorganization status

files and directors

if there's time i want to talk about they just but look like we were pretty

his smart i'm also and also the smoke them

it'd probably be interested

interested in all this but probably if we had to pick something that we would talk on for ten minutes or so while they're coming here i would be we were going to station status or

i mean i just that done it so

and about it and we sort of have a plan for getting things organized and

and i think a crucial part of that is the idea of not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero backups so that there won't be huge number of and

and although day said that if we want to do it just tell him and he'll do it level zero then

so good so maybe we should just go ahead and get everything ready and

so i think we do need to talk a little bit about

we don't do during this meeting we have a little

but we're ready to do it

someone can films and wrestling

so we we did another version of the beats where we separated each beats with spoken digit chuck came

and so it just goes beep one beat and then the phrase and then deep

phrase and then deep too beaten in the phrase and

conditions and we did with the automatic segment asian and i don't

listen to probably five or ten minutes of it from the beginning really

i sort of spot check here and there and it sounded pretty good

so i think it'll work

and with the numbers there it's much less likely

i don't think it's probably in the original file i

maybe they're listen to it again make but

that's what i thought make but certainly the software shouldn't do that so

as long as i it's probably just you know somehow the audio device gets on for a second there's some distance or something pickups

a pet right the only part that might be confusing is when chuck is reading digits

you know actually are we having them seventh grade eight seventy

we didn't cut those out not try to catch it so we don't we didn't in order to cut them i would have to listen to it and we

that so we they are transcribing the digits

the great that be what i'm having the transcript do because it can be extracted and then

but let's talk they just we have a whole pilot is i haven't been transcribed

actually i of digits if we want to move on to digits

actually i when they're more related anything transcription so that see i've been

so that see i've been we got that sorted

we're doing out i'm how're doing on the rest of the

i hire i've hired two extra people already expected hire two more and

and i've moved on now too i'm calling set three i sort

i'm calling set three i sort of thought if i do it set some groups of five then i can have like sort of a parallel processing through the current

hours so i'm going to go up to twenty hours be should everything is processed and released and that's what my goal is package twenty

good i'm hiring people who really are they would

got a good core group i mean i the so the difference if if the idea and works out the difference in the job would be that they primarily would be checking through things that were already done by someone else is the most unpleasant and correcting

so with the new transcriber and so

at present people have been doing these transcription a channel at a time and

and so i've i trained the new one the new the newest one to use the visual from the channel that is going to be transcribed at any given time and it's just

because what happens then is you scan across the signaled once in a while you'll find a blip that didn't show up in the pre segment patient

it's interesting once in a while to back a back channel or

and the idea qualities so good so they can they

yes let's talk about digits in that area

so we have a whole bunch of dues that we've read we have the forms and so on but only

but only a small number of that had a not a small

and so we need to decide what we want to do and

no we know what they read because we have the forms

no they make mistakes we have the forms

and there's the issue that they it's not an option it

we because people make mistakes and i was

and i was just asking just out of curiosity if with ds or i recognize are getting one percent were there

so if you go forced alignment that the force but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistakes or false starts it's much less it's much less common than one percent but that's pretty uncommon

false starts it's but that's pretty uncommon

like they're couple different ways of doing it we could

ways of doing it we could use the tools ivory developing transcribe it hire some people

it hire some people or use the transfer to do we get

to do we get like i. b. m. transcribe it

you know they're doing it anyway and unless we tell

would be a problem from mine are pre recorded

so i think it depressing it mean it'll be in the midst

think it depressing it mean it'll be in the midst of a digit string so

there might be a place where it's deep seven deep eight beep eight he

we had a discussion and i had discussed last week about how to proceed with you know with tom's work and

work and one of the obvious current restless that since we now have two of segment turning it works you know amazingly we should actually reevaluate the recognition result using you know without cheating on the second page

and how do we find the transcripts all those so the

the reference this also those segments so there's actually

the reference this also those segments it's so there's actually i

i can hand once no actually miss have they sort sophisticated scoring program that you can give a that time

does time constraint would alignment

justin programs we could use you know there would be so much hand labeling need that generally train

justin programs doing that so and i think you're in the

so and i think you're in the process of doing that so

i'll give you a lot more data to want process of doing that so

i'll give you a lot more data to want

that if you find that you can lower the false alarms that you get where there's no speech that would be useful for us to know so

so right now you get fall you know false on speech regions when it's just like breath or something like that and interested

and it involves starting i believe starting with they

it's always the wizard but

actually always the wizard but it starts where the was just pretending to be a computer and it goes through a each generation system

actually it's changed so synthesis for the first time now system the system

for the first time now the system

as here's some more data should just be part

data should just be part of the corpus or not

right so i just went under say i'm hadn't quite follow this process

might want to try collecting it the other way around sometimes saying that the computer isn't up yet and so then

abort retry fail

yes this is what was the question so because at first they were and

yes this is what was the question so they were saying they were not because at first they were and say

the question so they were saying they were not going to and i said they were and say

no going to and i said that's philly if we're going to try to do it for corpus there might be people who are interested in acoustics or

doing nothing we end up doing it was just something in acoustics no the question is

it was just something to do i no the question is do we saved one or two channel so all of them

this is too because could stick language model tuned in for like com english system it's to be training to training that and development data for the smart come with them

but i'm not about the legal aspect of if that is anything right

we say that because it's it's potentially useful and right

and now what we do is separate question i right

but it's another day we have and

i think if i q. w. they start recording person conversations is that part of the meeting corpus

know it doesn't dry face that i mean

and that was my intention meetings a name and then later on

i think it intention so it's part of the reason that i wanted to bring this up is probably want to handle it as a special case or do we want to folded in would give just give it a title

i think it is would give everyone who's involved

i think it is would give everyone who's involved has their own user id give it session i. d.'s let all the tools they handle meeting recorder handle that or do want a special case it and if we

but as far as submitting it shouldn't label as part of this meeting corp should

it's because i don't see why not it's just a different topic it be it

because i have an extra it's just a different topic

i have an extra point which is the natural in this issue

because we have like meeting to have a reason that's one of the reasons

i don't i wouldn't call reading digits meetings of interaction

we were doing but i put it under the same directory tree you know it's in your and

convenient for you all saying is that there's no way they were going to tell people that reading digits as meetings right

there's a but if it makes it easier for you to put full in the same procedures and have in the same directory tree knock yourself that

there's a couple of other questions that i have to and that

so we don't have to worry about transcribing so what we will have

so what we will have to worry about formats that's that's another argument to keep

but i'm no one would have a problem with our folding and for some acoustic modeling or something

i bet that sounds good they even have a reading list it's pretty funny

and everything else was sort of committed

those were in were those backed up in on backed up

you're talking about back to i'm much more concerned about the backed up

i haven't looked to see how much of that the on backed up is cheap i mean

day we had a lot of days to listen to this recordings had out

i mean and there's been this conversation going on about getting another file server and

you do that it'll take the opportunity and get another big raft of disk i it's the

really the backup issue rather than the file server thing i think there's an argument for having you know you

my understanding is the issue isn't really the file server we could always put

we could always put more discs on it's a back up system it's the back to back up the past

more discs on it's a back up system it's the back to back up the past

it's a back up system so up the past

that was me i was the one who said it what about putting the the c. d. rom or d. v. d. or something

they'll these all the l. d. c. distribution or for they're on c. d. but they're not like

we have also just here i'm long time ago no ten years ago ninety one and they're still all fine where they burned

that depressed ones and they're still i mean usually they're

last for while not forever they've been fighting

but i you don't want to part have your only copy on the media that fails

if you have haven't professionally passed you know they're good for decades about so how about

if you if they last say they actually

say they actually last like five years typical and

which you can do that but that's pretty annoying because the c. d.'s are so slow

because the c. d.'s are so slow

i would think so archive angle just use tape one thing i don't understand

but normally are correct but even

but even without that the backup system is becoming saturated

but we still have but this backup system is smart enough to figure out that something hasn't changed it doesn't need to be back up again

the media it's just the general exceed backup system is becoming saturated so then that's right right so

actually you know we could do that just with the tape with the current tape have to about this girl i don't know what to

i don't know what to do these tapes

i don't know what kind of tape the opposite

the one we you just run a program to restore them

have to i mean no we have what we don't we have our but it might interfere with their back on schedule

kind of take drive gang and we have something downstairs just to

no boundaries is point is a good one and we don't

point is a good one and we don't have to do anything ourselves to do that they're already

to do that they're already right now on tape

that's not a bad idea

that's what i was going to say is that the disc is so cheap it's essentially you know close to free

and the only thing that cautious the backup issue it's a first order and we can so once it's on tape

and the only thing that cautious the backup so once it's on tape

order and we can take care of that by putting on backed up drives and just backing up once on to this i think it's

it's i'll talk to dave and see what how what the best way of doing that is

probably getting busy little utility that will manually burn a tape for you and that's probably

we should probably make a tape for you and that's probably the right way to do it

for recording the meetings that's what i'm wondering is

we an automated that my intention

is to do a script it'll do everything no it's all mean you have to physically put a tape in the driver

big but you but not at the same time is that the different type of

big but you would be anyway but not at the same time is that the different type of

big but you would be anyway not at the same time of

no he's saying get a whole different drive right because but there's no not too just give

drive but there's no reason to do that just give a dedicate

drive but there's no reason to do that just give a dedicate

if we already have it there and it's i'm saying if you go to dave and asking can i use your tape robots he will say

no he'll say he will say that's going to screw up our backup operation

he'll say if that means that it's not going to be backed up standard late great

i dave has promoted this in the past so i don't think he's actually it's definitely

so i don't think he's actually lost it it's definitely no problem all right

thing into the archive interviewer

and then it wouldn't be this extra if

but you can have it n. w. archive right otherwise you don't

which i'm would make ever but the system and very happy so

so i think that's a good idea

yes i'm using tendon features you are pet

tendon features i got you are pet and i'm still tinkering with the kelpie future

that was on males they're was tend to upset right that was before i tried it on the females

we had reached the point where i'm the male portion of the development sets the one of the developments that this is the the mail right with takes the kelpie features pretty much identical

c. so then i thought great odds

thought great odds i'll just look make everything works on the females and right

and right you know there was a c. percent difference

is there less training it

and the testing it's called switchboard

so something's wrong so

so but she now between the males and females to certainly a much bigger difference in the scaling range than there is they just within males and so

what you're using before was scaling factors that were just from the they made s. or i friend and networks that's true

networks that worked fine that's true

and it didn't hurt on the male so

and i'm now trying be time suddenly

so the it's not helps if you it only on the test and i'm

and i'm currently retraining another set of models whereas both in the training in the past and then

maybe between one and two percent for the female and so

and so you know i'm open to suggestions and it is

it's much worse t. l. because if you don't you'll be now in both systems you know the females are completely worth with the yuppie future so there must be

what's the standard that's i thought

that's i thought the performances actually a little better and you know some males

that you overall yes but on this

yes but on this particular development tests that they're actually little more

we're looking at the discrepancy between the sri that's right to someone trained with the teacher

what's of the free right is funny is that if you have any indication of your standard futures you

this is the mass cook more i mean is this different in the same direction or not

training or is it that you're training or it's almost

which we used to do only three and then we found

then we found out that can it in with

you'd write it might be that one more iterations would help but it's

if you if you marry some years ago you can try each one on across validation and

do because we save all these immediate models

and in each case i'm say in what

and the question he was asking one point about pruning

the likelihood for lower for the guilty p. and so there's the question if

for the guilty p. and so there's the question if

the guilty p. if you mean did you see this and the sri system

was looking through log files and the likelihood

you can't directly compare them because for every set of models you computer new normalization

and so these locker movies are and directing terrible because you

terrible because you have different normalization comp for each of you try

but still it's a question if you have some threshold

that's what i was wondering something i mean

i mean if you have one threshold that works because the range of your likelihood is in this area true and very conservatively

and it because there could be lots of things right

and what's the topic was see each ones

can actually continuously varies between the two and so i went

we've always use it anyways the major difference between the two is actually it's

that the peel e. and the reason guilty is been advantageous in slightly noisy situations is because peel t. does this moving at the end by on her breast model and

so one thing i haven't done yet is to actually do all of this with a much larger with a full training so right now we're using forty it's just strange said that's about you know that factor for smaller than what we use when we trying the focus so somebody
