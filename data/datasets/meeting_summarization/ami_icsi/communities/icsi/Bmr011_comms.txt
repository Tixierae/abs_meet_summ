i just hear about how things are going with the transcription right
on the meeting which includes like pre segregation and the developments multi trans
of if this microphone seems to people
you're saying the for dialogue purposes so
jane would know more about the transcriber and that's true i
mean i we could discuss this
and he's always they just rave about how wonderful adam's challenged
at present it's not possible with limitations of the original designing software
i'm relying on the technician also makes how about i'm
any given that's the buckle would the two mikes on either side
if i'm speaking if you're speaking or someone over there speaking it if you look across correlation functions you end up with a
we switched positions or something so you can't and
day he needs to leave for from here to make it to forty five flight know
they wanted to do i had read some papers that look like they've
not doing it but it's really it's i've seen demonstrations of the microphone it's amazing how they can cut out noise and then they have little
even if we're not and video and
right now we're all being recorded but we're not being taped
but it definitely the case of microphone erases if there's a community interested in this i think we need a researcher
i mean how we're going to side
of the problem that no one was currently involved in the project is really hot to do it
one or just i wanted to keep it clear who's they were who's and
your data said she said it takes about sixty minutes transcription for every five minutes of real time so it's about
time so it's about twelve to one which is what we
be still when they're finished that means that they're finished with their pastor they still need to be added and all that but it's
and so it's very similar and so
too they do send it out but my understanding
i gotcha send it out but my understanding is that's all this company does is transcription for i b. m. further speech so most
so each person gets one of these channels adjusted all that
art mary asked me the thing but i'm wondering outfits
yes or i don't know they were not and then you have enough bitching them but they would do about trusting them so just think you know
were which segment they belong to so right
they belong to so that's sort of why not do the forced alignment
you could always chop it up but
chop it up but you need to have a reference of which words went with which
if you if maybe you have one already of that first at the meeting that that first transcribe meeting the one that i transcribed
i'm i have some but do you have could you generate percentage every sixteenth i think
so those ought to darn of course of course
actually as you get transcripts for new meetings we can try
but i think also it's just issue that when you look at the you been you look at switchboard for instance very close up there places where whether it's a constant evolve you still have trouble calling it a particular phone
here now in the state most of to the
this is like jest real each sentence on something like that they actually
and most of the things we talked about it in fairly high level and
@reject@ high level and bomb a person maybe we there's some of the others it's a balance that would be really to offer
at two questions one of them is jerry feldon script they
regular urine off that they're no longer
i don't mean that they're angry but

about what's going on talk about the meeting because everyone has ever
about the meeting everyone has ever in that
but i know there is gushing and then at a previous meeting that i missed but just about
so let's so it's just good end the building right now so
something you already know about the meeting it's coming up and i
no it's what meeting i maybe something we should handle outside the meaning
so sounds like a topic of conversation
so better quality close talking mike so the one issue
but if we could actually standardize you know the microphone
a double thing it's the equipment and also how sworn and he's
we're doing i think that the point of doing the close talking mike is to get a good quality signal we're not doing research on close talking mikes so
microphone they want that they might want to just you know you could imagine taking the for signals from these table mics and trying to do something with them
don't know i mean i know that having read i mean i would imagine it would be more expensive to have a rape microphone but couldn't
details but fifteen or sixteen
once you make the up front investment and can sort of save it out each time and not have to worry about that just states faster than it might be worth having that do i'm not
they they'd have the data in the transcript for them and then they can offer up the room
they'd have the data in the transcript and then they can offer up the room
to be forthcoming but be i do want to say that it's hard to follow one channel the conversation even if you know the people and if you're
never heard of so you know one of these people was transcribing of the networks group talking should
just did and here is a collaborating institution that phone through to do it
art and still might be a good thing but i'm just wondering now i'm
them it's a real benefit having brian involved because of his
and actually i should say this is what don has husband he's already been really helpful and chopping up these
that's the first of all you
i'm i have some but that's the one lover could you generate percentage every sixteenth i think
but that would be really valuable
you're dealing with constance that would be easier than women you know
at that point because it's you know there's this movement from here to here and i'm i i know but just saying what
it like so that you can do far afield studies of those gestures or
i mean people made a lot of use of ten minutes and

time to discuss and
so sounds
yes if he's not going to school at so you want it that's good
type of i mean for instance here and this one isn't
of things sort of auditory related largely for hearing aids and so on but
going to be and therefore it would not be highly unlikely that room would be outfitted with some very carefully designed array of microphones
so it's a good thing to do but doesn't solve the problem of how do you solve things when this one like we're it's best to mike's and in this imagined
then and that drives in that direction that's right i mean if someone came in and said we really want to do it
at some level so they usually do a mix
there's what you save i mean if you're going to do research with it
right in turn there's not enough interest to overcome
times about this one she just put on a video camera but
but why like just throw microphone out there i mean
and meetings you know i think that they go as long as a almost two hours in some cases so
in some cases so it means you know if we've
he expressed a lot of interest in reliability it's
i and that's what i base the format that i did i base it on
way and we had a really conversation
i get to censor kind of like that like it's like a pool of somewhat secretarial
and before they go be beyond the first one
actually i did so are they giving any marking in other words it i have to ask right
him and that's my email to him that needs to be forthcoming but
a lot of cross
and now i mean it does so it's way better
run it through and if they don't have speech and we don't run it through we base
right so i think we talk retirement three level three things what
we had this idea before of having like but i think that's the point
something a little bit color and there is this problem know that if we give them a chance to exercise later we might end up with like five minutes out of a one hour
which is john synthesis expressed primer a major interest in having meetings which were all english speakers and he wasn't trying

and even items that he has let's talk about what's going on talk because
right now so let's talk about that those plus
things so we can talk so and that's just missed folks are coming back next week and so
back next week and so talk about that
in terms of the multi trance that's being modified by day feel part to handle multi channel recording
also had a completely unrelated thing i had a discussion today with burger called myer was german scientist
on i mean it seems like it's a microphone stoned affect each other than country just you know record them with an array and then just not use all the data it's just a
it's ninety all the data i see it's just a lot of infrastructure that for our particular purpose we so we need to set
it's ninety nine percent what you're doing is good shutting off most of the my and going
i'll be you it'd be if we can have at least make use of the data that we're recording as we go some
if you're it's see kind of person is doing ray processing actually care about funny little times and
right in turn only but i know overcome
papers but looks to me like that's the name of that has developed a system that burden lieberman developed for the annotated crafts approach so
like medical transcriptionist type people them no it's mostly it's for their
it's good to get sort of short segments if you're going to do recognition especially forced
especially forced alignment so
and to know i think me what it's was it that people were switching
i need to write him i just
so those ought to darn of course of course
that the more data we have to try the alignments on the better so i'd be
great on tuesday and i was planning to do just preliminary look over of the two that are finished and then given to you
group even there he hadn't
know it just didn't come together but in and the other thing too is when they originally said no they didn't know about this post editing capability thing
right that was a big so

and so you'd be better if we had close talking makes perfect right
i dan didn't see it that yesterday pregnancy
up recorded people maybe
mike's and you get really good being point that sort of thing and
and then they have the little ones ones too i mean but they don't have or block of wood right
that data you have to have one by more disk space
it's so i'm kind of skeptical but
that way what we could do is if there's someone else's interested they could have a separate set up with they wouldn't be trying to sync with hours which might
they which might be useful for them
i was did you so i thought you did actually did you u. redid digit
the folks that they're sub contracting out the transcription too are they like court reporters or time you what yes
given all of the networks are meetings meaningful
and the other one is there's some good used to be can make it the transcribers do other things

crawling i'm talking about that you were in a say
things i have time to my topic that i would mention d.
in africa plugging three that's in three also we've
also we've talked before about getting another radio right
and also he was interested in the pre segment patient
so to gifts to trust cover some information but you don't want to there's still speech in addition to it so the thing we it now
which is justice speech on speech you texas on the makes fun
taking our data and putting men in that form and see how that works out i
we should go beyond x. but
i think jerry's group so there's
you know i don't think the more political and distributed
they're angry but just something with the more variation in pres out of contras and so forth would be neat so if anyone

in fact at one point we had a proposal in with rutgers where are we were going to do some of the sort of perch and it's like the processing and they were
you mean to actually get a microphone array and
for the meetings and the physical space and
right and it's just to be if we have more information on the same
so and in terms of like the conventions that i'm at that i've adopted it there's no conflict at all and he
at all and he was you know was very interested in on how she
curiosity i mean also all that heavy accents the networks are
so this is a i i don't know what that means
so i'd be good for just to know as transcription they're coming through the pipeline from the transcribers just
transcribers just to sort of we're playing around with her parameters on the recognize that
reached that point but how do we step up the recording meetings
it's you know there's this movement i i know what

mean anything discuss
i'm i start off of this
don't get on and then just sort of about a summer some and a half away from your mouth
and there was some talk about maybe they had headphones that are uncomfortable for people too so says
you know what i'm doing right now is i'm trying to you get some information about which channel will there's some speech and that's
getting to give some talks and so on but anyway
and so on but anyway you might be interested in that their minds they had
i think that the thing will be in again talking to these other people to see what you know what we can do
of this so first of all i've got a transcribers
i know that they recorded one meeting are they willing
people but the thing is or four people is

i missed but just about the wish list item of getting good quality close talking mike son every speaker
those plus close talking mike spider
that seems like a good collection of things mom nothing think of
mom nothing think of other things i
around so i would just go out and get in order of if this
have them all be the same mike i think
excellent so would be like way providing also speaker id potentially wonderful
who is you know it's a c. s. professor
x. but i mean there's a lot of having exceeded that we're not getting now that we could
i thought that all these people had sort of said no twice already if that's not so that no

video that sort of a video has a little different nature since right
for maxwell flexibility later you really don't want to end up with just one channel that you pointed in the direction of the person with a maximum energy or something like that i mean you want actually
i think it's sort of hard just playing they you know just having played individual files and i
lives with see sri recognize or can't make use of some time marks
and have these transcribers and we're
@reject@ we there's some of the others it's a balance that
so i mean there's possibilities there i think jerry's group
so they're down to three or four people but the thing and they stop
you didn't say that speaking they speaking english i bet he mandated
i remember knowing the applications he care

we haven't set around the agenda
at some level but then you know there's that there's what you save i mean
it of saving the result of the being from
of sites like right now sri is probably going to invest a lot of internal funding into recording meetings also which is good
available so if we can get the investing and just for the entrance infrastructure and then
i have to mention the human subjects problems that increase with video
time and with the improvement in the database and the ass or any interface be possible to and just do a quick drag thing and get thee that they specific place the of each of those of time tag associated with the beginning of every segment
so i actually wrote to him and he answered great that sounds really interesting phonetics lab meetings

and it actually in addition to that they a close second mics or born in such a way as to best captured the signal and
was this month one thing i mean i don't know i mean i know
microphone but couldn't chew kind of approximate the natural situation by just shutting off those channels one year later on i mean it seems
but they'll be recording with video and
so what he wants me to do and what we
and what we will do in is to provide them with the arty transcribe meeting for him to
training i get the sense and more secretarial and that
like medical transcriptionist and that what they're doing is giving them

purposes so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those mics is that what you mean
are as they were interested in r.'s they want wanted to
r.'s they want wanted to get some uniformity with us about the transcription and so on
meeting each person got their own meeting i don't
i have some but that's the one lover i'm truck training on so that percentage sixteenth i think
but something that allows for overlapping change of these things and then this would give
but this time he wasn't vehement and he said you know liz come to a meeting trial and try to convince
but i really like to look at to get some meetings where there's a little bit of heated discussion like art humans

right and it's just and the transcripts
with i'm not quite the connection but spend a lot
i don't remember the acronym the one
i'm i have some but do you have could you generate percentage every sixteenth i think
hopefully someone to make use of it i mean wide range
use of it i mean people didn't
all on they all native speakers did i mean did you mean and non british now that's what i mean he
that's what i mean he doesn't care no it he met and on british i think we have zero

and so it seems to me in terms of like
doing this just getting the data because
but it's it's impossible or if it's a lot of efforts and have to just pound it i think that
at that point because it's you i'm i but just saying what
describe and now i'm suggesting a ticket or features maybe there's even
maybe there's even a better way to do it but
a better way to do it but that's you know sort of a traditional way of describing these things

the i mean he didn't do a very extreme too but just it was a sort of any he's did start
out there i mean the thing is once you actually have serious interest in any of these things you actually have to put a lot of effort in
you don't have to leave for it i just
i don't know but that's because you know you do all of them and then combine them
except and the answers we don't actually know the answer because we haven't tried both ways
actually i but they're not giving from really find ill right
but is a go there to have this on meeting it like so it

running recognition on one conversation but it's
so if they hear something off in the distance they don't they just go
in which case you know if they wouldn't be able to catch anything channel then they'll switch between i think that
then they'll switch between but i think that might change
gestures or
would be neat so if anyone has ideas

but it's isn't working yet
you very makes it a lot especially for people with big head
to do he downloaded from c. d. on to audio tapes he did
tapes he did it one channel per audio tape so
but i mean it if they said they don't want to anymore
anymore so what was his name

probably get to the of talked about
involved in i'm blanking on the name of the project
and they do have some sir soft raise my impression
soft raise my impression related to alison that he once
alison that he once to experiment with taking our data and
of viewing area whenever you have coding categories and you're dealing with tax on to me then you can have branches that have alternative choices that you could use for each of them and

it looks really great he has a prototype i
if someone was on the axis between the two is talking then you get a big pique their and if
they wanted to do i had read some papers that look like they've already done some work
at some level but then so they usually do a mix
i think so too i did you sign up form the form i'm pretty
for instance marking and some overlapping actually overlapping

and interesting thing around as
it but finished
harder on the main thing is having the microphone close too though not too
though not too close
assisting you should've invited to this meeting forgot

adds as extra you know very variable for each speaker to deal with on the microphone parent
i told i'd asked him privately
and it is a little bit of a track like them free on
still worth it would be if we got someone other than me who knew how to set it up and could do the recording so
exactly and i was that's right could do the recording so i didn't have to do each time

sounds fun sounds like uniformity wince
for short term research it's just there's just so much effort that would have to be done upfront not so you is it
about more details later
see i mean i think you know they proceeded along the bit let's see what comes out of it and you know have smarts sessions with them it's a real benefit
we actually don't know which piece goes where and i understand

makes in the advantage when you don't breathe
sabbatical so might be around
based on what did he that's that dan had worked in that then nose
interesting and so you can plot out who was sitting so that's the cross correlation was doing forming
i'm not about video that sort of

second item as the just visits and what's going on there
so we'll we'll be over there talking to him after class on friday
but if you get some of his they had said the prime interest in that but then and that drives in that direction that's right i mean if someone
and what he said was that what they'll be providing is will not be as fine grange in terms of the time information
that the people and that's you know i need to get back to him and i think you know explore that a little bit more and see what they'll be giving us specific that i have

of the room and how it how the recordings are done that kind of thing
three level three things what one was we've had some discussion the past about some very high level labeling those types of overlaps and the types of overlaps
labeling those types the types of overlaps
of overlaps and so forth that someone could do
second was somewhere or level just during these more precise

they've and i will be visiting with john candy
either using you know the mics on the table or using signal energies from they had worn mike's and that is to try to construct
and that is to try to construct a map of where people were sitting
then there's a website i lots the papers i look
art know and still might be a good thing but i'm just wondering now i'm

pique their and if someone's talking on one side or the other it was the other way and then
it's really it's and then they have amazing how they can cut out noise and then they have little ones too i mean
so to save that data you have to have one channel recording per my can you ray by more disk space
actually overlapping fashion the value of of articulate tori features
i think they're open to it i are they willing

actually i can't remember where they were going to do routinely park city or not but one
d. the big a raise that place is
that place is like rutgers and brown and other places
form has gone heaviest did you so i thought you did
if you do a force one and on something that really even if you do sixty minutes

these commercial things out and buy that have four mike's or something and
having that do i'm not so much worried about the specific mention that
mention that but as a practical matter but the real issue is
but the real issue is that there's no way to do a recording extended to what we have now with those q.
in the sense that you have microphones that are distance that you know mine might have and

as we go some sort of this is the first site that has really collected these really impromptu meetings
more elaborately and the focus on reliability he expressed
it wasn't i thought that one of the proposals was i b. m. was going to do initial forced but
with potential use from the defense department are we willing to
student groups or filmmakers or something a little bit color exactly there is this problem know that if we give

twelve to one which is what we were thinking swell in
type people no it's mostly it's for their speech recognition products
when with him gone it's sort of trickled off
so i just need to find out who's running it now so
it turned out to be a bit of a problem and i had one that

some point ago we thought that it boy we really have to ramp up to do that like we just
right because like i was thinking it would be fun to if you would mind to give us a tree segment patient if you if maybe you have one
so over there right now you have two overlapping segments at the same time and with
things that are in the speech that are actually something where you work and for language modeling in mars also
in mars also interested in andreas

we have because i think weather's great hero wires probably second harder on the main thing
right so actually the way jose is wearing his is correct
yet they don't have the transcription standards they don't have the are they going to do video as
channels and this meeting we've got eight people and six bikes and they're already using

but we have more than one type of i mean for instance
know is he involved in
in on how she i said you know this
was caught up and the we clink is recording meeting

or who talks the loudest
and it's a there's a wallaf mike's and
is unique but the but
and to do that if we're going to end up greatly increased the space that we use up we also

from oakland so this morning
right that makes it schedule all the time but do
but that's because it's different to get there for research than to actually apply it and so
they asked if like someone who's interested in the general by locking what was asked are you recording video

i don't think we can share the resource in that way what
is there an interest in getting video recordings for these meaning
people have problem people not wanting to be videotaping of the problem
only but i know there is interest from other places that are interested in looking at meeting data and having the video so it's just

i base it on their work almost directly in combination with t. i.
and maybe it's already finished the d.
the other thing is that there's a number of things at the transcription side that transcribers can do like dialogue act tagging fluency not that hard
fluency tagging

group talking should be i don't really know what a lot of these abbreviation czar
but i just put them in parentheses because it's the convention and i just because you know
just out of you don't know be curious to look at that
just out of curiosity i mean also all that

@reject@ we there's some of the others it's a balance that would be really to offer
right and we could also we might try advertising again because i think free lunches that's a idea
because i think it'd be good if we can get a few different sort of nine intern all types of meetings and
types of meetings and just also more data i think

interested in andreas as so if you
as so if you want to process of utter renting the first thing they say is in that as could it has some kind of interrupt
course some of that can be like down mexico like
or i don't know if they meet regular urine off that

that little the boxes under the table
in that their minds they had i thought of an interesting project that somebody could try to do with the data from here either using
that's one thing so johnson

you're talking on someone else's like it's but i mean it's not just that it's also you it's also like that you know breathing
so i think just do a field trip at some point
so that they can do in real time and not say that each channel individual

how about i'm trying to stop divide the speech portions into different portions if there's some activities in different people
you have to the appropriate normalization to turkey and are probably
how big is data say is not as much as an hour and a half

something i i didn't put on the list but on that same day later on and maybe
all the time but do you think that that the john candy should be involved in the somehow or not i idea
no i mean that's what all this is about they haven't done it yet

but i mean for optimum flexibility later you're going to save each channel but
each channel but i think in practical situations you would have some engine of some sort doing some processing to reduces some to equivalent of a single microphone it was very direction
art mary asked me the same question is sort of thing but i'm wondering outfits we can talk

fourteen and we actually only have fifteen one of them
weather it's with the pre segment taste or not they have a chuck
not exceed non academics you know like because you can drive

interested in even if exceeded itself isn't
and it seems like as long as we can time align the beginning do we need to mix it with the rest i don't
you know so yes i think you'd be a separate

about it there's human subjects problem is the fact
so that was a contribution they could make terms of time money you know
thinking plus we could also get he supposed to be trained next week

each of them and it just ends up looking like a graph corpus sensation is that let's see
is that let's see his annotated transcription grass
but there's first chong and then a transcription

now i also want to say a different direction is rankings very so
so i course my briefly with him
no i think it's for that purpose i'm just doing meetings as being neat way to get people talking naturally

files and i mean i know you i know what your voice sounds like an sort of familiar with
making knowing the international standard studies i never studied to be b. n. did where they trained done it this he's
the international standard i never studied to be b. n. did where they trained done it this

i should sort of depends where you are in especially since pilates
but i mean we had this discussion many times and the answers we don't
the one that i transcribed do you have

channels i'd say like i don't know at least half of them probably on every drug or have are have
don husband been taken for stab actually using jeans first the first meeting the chain transcribe which we
which we did have some problems with and to know

but there's going to be a real problem even
will and so we have to have a dialogue with them about it sounds like with
it's listen i spoke at some like on tuesday and

but the to write him i just you know it's like got overtaxed at the time
but the it is true that the segments i haven't tried the segments the tivo gave you but the overtaxed at the time
gave you but the segments that in your first meeting are great i mean that's

suppose we get in the
i it's and people position although it is just saying where the weakling because in the chain where
we have all the data transcribed and have

at that point was caught up and
two questions com is you know what how do we
it's not really problem moment because we haven't reached that point but

the d. modification too small to trance which will allow fine grain and coating of overlaps
women you know would think that is being able to code that there's a for fricken tips extending from here would be a lot easier than classifying precisely which val that was i think they'll
doesn't care no it british's we have zero

i actually this might be a neat thing to talk to acoustic features versus psychological
be a neat thing to talk to sort of may acoustic features versus psychological categories
some sort of categories but something that

and then you have it then and then it's natural in all senses in the sense that you have microphones just the source of data
and then you have it then and then it's natural just the source of data
i told

thing i think it's been very useful for a lot of people so
i i wanted to make a pitch for trying to collect more meetings
it's all try and then the other thing is

yes mean in terms of topic
yes and in terms of the fact that they're describing abstract things topic
and it just i whites right

right and we could also we might free lunches that's a idea
students and i'm willing to try to learn i mean i'm i would it all
i mean i'm i would do my best

at two questions one of
so i'm giving him our our initial meeting because yes
i bet he mandated speaking american

i don't do they still meet regularly or i don't know if they meet
all did i mean crawling bush and i think we don't have a lot of all english meetings right now
all on they all native speakers did i mean did you mean and non british now

but if anyone has
the main thing would be if anyone has knowledge about ways to post process away from that would give us better recognition

for doing that and in fact she said that it's useful for them to know and started to collect their data too
one thing i was going to say was that we could get more if they had mounted microphones even

just get a half dozen of the family the only
of the family the only problem with that is right now some legitimate start working

right i'm not i'm following say that again
right now we've got two microphones in the room that are not quote unquote standard so why don't say that again

this and sometimes
makes it a lot easier head and you know we're

i mean there's just a double thing it's the equipment
and assuming articulate tory future values for those things

ever spoken with a lot of people here not everyone
and seeing a demonstration of the modified multi trance which you mention

it's it looks really great he
i think they'll spells or i think harder

and that's not working at the moment
he might be excited too and it might be very appropriate for him to or he might have no interest whatsoever i just really don't

things and so he's he and possibly student that there's
that might willie not you mean on and see

that there's students is who gave a talk here last year may
bikes and they're already using fourteen and

a and i also want to say his he can't stay all day he needs to
our like what is unique but the

but i known better see in this friday what kind of level who wants to get involved
even if you do have something really long you need to know you could always

this is has done a big meeting room instrumented meeting room with video and microphone raise and very elaborate software is he
that's what they're starting up is he doing working on that

in one notable difference actually i
it and so for scientific reasons was that was good instrument this room is we wanted it but

but one when difference from the audio side was that they are interested in using rain mikes
so i mean i just tell you party line on that the reason

you party line on that the reason i didn't go for that here was because the focus both of my interest and adams interest was in impromptu situations and
we're not recording much impromptu situations but that's because it's

i don't know what they're going to do it i don't know how big their rate is if you
is if you were going to save all of those channels later research you do use up a lot of space and there's for

know save it out or have whoever's interested save
save that data out transfer

see the i think we need a researcher here is interested to push it along
one of them is a graduate student in psychology

and so i think we could get aiding microphone rain here pretty easily and
i think they're open to it i think you know all these things

and have it fixed two one channel of some sort
if was a way to save time to sort of solve each of these those

you know so yes i think you'd be a separate set up and the
set up and the assumption that you could time that too

i mean it's just it's worth considering as sort of it certainly gets skew
i mean it's just it's worth considering it certainly gets skew

so you would have a completely separate set up
which would mean that the sampling times and so forth would be all over the place compared to this so

if i've heard times about this one
camera but it's sort of like saying the primary interested in ins and dialogue things

to do it right so i think mister l. d. c. or something like that things much better shape to do all that we
each i gave each of them at their own data set to them

i it occurred to me has done something to human subjects for
permission form probably not has gone heaviest

out i explained to him in detail be conventions that where you thing here in this and this word level transcript
you know i explained you know the reasons that we were not putting more elaborately and

independently as what about reliability so
right and it seems like we had this idea before of having like linguistic students brought down for free lunches that's a but i think that's the point

you explain what the atlas
i you know at this point i think

acronym the one the what i think your friend do they have this concept of that annotated transcription graphic representation and that's
except i can say that my transcribers use the mexico mostly ways

still has an account here i told
here i told him he could at this say on you small to try us and have a look at the already done transcription he and he did and what he said

@reject@ there that they've hired these people is
unless there's a huge disparity in terms of the volume on the mix in which case

per audio tape so each of these people is transcribing from one channel
and then what he's going to do is check it

i think so i would think hope so we really foolish to do otherwise
if they're very different because it's i

there a lot of words that are so reduced phonetically that makes sense when you know what the person was saying before that's
i should sort of depends where you are in especially since pilates but i mean we had this

given all of the effort that is going on here in transcribing why do we have like b. m. doing why not meetings meaningful
so this is a i i don't know what that means

i think you need to like a porcelain before you didn't topping thing
no we use the fact that so when

they have a chunk and then they transcribe the words in the checking that maybe
the checking that maybe they choose the chunk are now they use pre segment patient incorrect necessary but there's

because i recognize or can it's
or can right it's all pretty good sized for the recognize are also

maybe they have some you know maybe actually it sounds like with us and concerns and
i don't maybe it's saved out in pieces or something that would help but

especially as you get in more voices the good
more voices the first meeting had i think just for think it's

thing i can't remember if we discuss this meeting but i know you and i talked about this a little bit there was an
of overlaps just matter you know providing so over there right now

and we're tha we're still
we're still bit slow on feeding at that point

so i can't member how much we talked about this in this meeting but that there's and there we had with them
in this meeting but that there's and there is one use that also we discuss which was when day finishes the we had with them

it's so i you're saying sort of remove the high-level constraint single bottom
described describe and now i'm just say just pictures

that they actually if we get into that might be good to hall john holland to this and ask
but is to this and ask his views on it

might have and give the coast mike's and
mike's and you have people talking naturally and the overlaps

but there's a lot of use that we could think of it by expanding the imitation choices
because we didn't actually advertised open

and try to convince people so i'm
people so i'm going to try go to their beating tomorrow and see

and they have very interesting meetings from the point of view of a very different type of talk and we have here and definitely been a four different meetings right
and definitely been a friend in me mean

it's all try and
you know like government you i don't you can drive that

i don't know if this is at all useful but i ask why
but i ask why what if i can maybe go around and talk to the different departments in this building to see

to see if there's any groups that for free lunch if we can still offer
if we can still offer that might willie you mean on and see

a lot of it can be done and also they are doing just fluency
a lot of it can be done great so and also they are doing just fluency taking to some degree

great so a lot of that's kind of i think
of i think there's a second pass and i don't really know

and i don't really know what would existed but
what would existed but there's definitely a second password doing too maybe in code some kinds of you know is it a question or not

the case no so there was this thing and so group even there
he hadn't what he'd said no two was for the main meeting

and the notion was raised before that could happen and it just you
happen and it just you know it just didn't come together but in and the other thing too is when they

department exactly
something a little bit color and i don't mean that they're angry but just something with the more variation in pres out of contras and so forth would be neat so if anyone has ideas i'm willing to do to like work to go try to talk to people but i don't really know which groups or worse there's a problem there in terms of thee commercial value enough it there is this problem know that if we give them a chance to exercise later we might end up with like five minutes out of a one hour there was this kid p. s. a. idea

to people but i don't really know which groups or worse there was this kid p. s. a. idea
there was this kid p. s. a. idea

chinese the second worst was positioned
so it's that's funny

gay agenda item on interest

i had a just a quick question but i know there is

coming up and i don't know if this is appropriate don't know

so i'm talking about that

and anything else striking

no i'm working on about is there anything new with the speech non speech

no i'm working on it but

m. four items that i put out for being on each end of on the meeting which

i went to the nest mating

the order we brought him up seems fine

so the one issue was that the of the the tell mike isn't as good as you would like and so

that the point

and the reason here is just that for the people doing work not on

not on microphones but i'm sort of like dialogue and so forth

on probably which don donnas going to be work and soon it

so and i also talked to marry this morning and she also had a

morning and she also had a strong preference for doing that and in fact

even beyond the number of radio channels we have because

if he's not going to school the good today so you want it

so it's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds don't get on and then

here and this one isn't very adjustable so

very adjustable so this is a bad because i can get because the fixed but

he's get because the fixed but

i mean it doesn't hurt to have a few extra microphones around so i

and so we i've only been able to find three jacks are working

no but can we get these wireless so

but you could just record these single no but my point is

but you could just record these single separately in time alignment with the stars my point is

right i'm not i'm following

so why don't we replace those they just too

however many we can plug in africa plugging

and so then that would be you know three right

so so we should go out to our full complement of whatever we can do have them all be

the same mike i think the no reason that it was done another way was because it was sort of experimental thing and i don't think

thing and i don't think anybody knew whether people would rather have more variety or more uniformity but

sounds fun sounds like uniformity wince

a couple times so the transcribers notice and in

notice and in fact there somewhere

sodas the recognize really

i'm not surprised him

you're talking on someone else's like but i mean it's not just that it's also you

it's also like that you know breathing

makes in the research the advantage when you don't breathe

what the research

we might as get it is uniforms we can't

now this is in the barn door after the horse was stolen we do

the horse was stolen we do have thirty hours north of speech which is something this way but

for future once we can get it more uniform

so i think just do a field trip at

too so says i said will do a field trip and see if we can get all of the same like that's more comfortable than these things which i think are horrible

great thank you very especially for people with big

easier and you know we're researchers so

researchers so we don't have any kids

johnson is coming on the second if ever spoken with

he expressed an interest in seeing the room

trance which you mention second

patient and then he's also interested and transcription conventions

it so the room it's things

so the room it's things like the new york i increased christie properties of the room and

and that's that will enable us to do tight time marking of the beginning and ending up overlapping segments at present it's not possible

in terms of like presentation that continues to be a terrific asset to the transcribers dude i

dude i know that you're also supplementing it further do want to mention

do want to mention something about that too

i'm just trying to do this by comparing and a treats gnawing energies in comparing and of for different channels and

who's interested in array microphones always do

so we want to see what commonality there is here you maybe

you maybe they'd want to or a mike here when we're doing things that would be that would be neat

or maybe it's not a specific array microphone they want that would be really neat

i also had a discussion so

it's got a for size group doing range of things sort of

but does auditory models and he's very interested in direction now d. and location and had models and from things and so

may come here in the fall for sort of a five month sabbatical so

and so you can plot out who was sitting next to who and was doing forming

just it was a sort of any he's did start

the other way and then it even looks different just if the two people inside or talking to and if one in the middle of it actually

the middle of it actually looks so different so

i was just thinking you know that's in here next feel that when he's talking my mike politics it better than your guys's mikes so if you

mikes so if you just looked at that's another q.

just looked at look that's another q. that's true

look at the energy on my mike you could get an idea about who's closest that's true

you just search for adam's voice on each individual microphone everybody's city

so just a little couple news items

johnson pacific special interest in microphone erase

that's what they're starting up doing working on that

i think they've instrumented the room but i don't work

but i don't think they haven't started recordings yet they don't

they don't have the are they going to do video as

because what i had read was they had a a very large amount of sulphur infrastructure for coordinating all this both in

i'm both in terms of recording also alive room where you're interacting dispenser interacting with computer and with the video and lots there's

i'm not all i know is that they've been talking me about a project that they're going to start up recorded people maybe in meetings

and it is related are as they were interested in

it but the thing we ultimately wanted to aim at was a situation where you were talking with one or more other people in and i'm impromptu and we didn't actually know what the situation is going to be and therefore

so is only for that reason is just you know yet another piece of research and seemed like

and seemed like you had enough troubles just so there's no like portable

just also there's there's no like portable array of mikes

also there's there's a whole range of things as a whole array of things that people do on this so

they have big raise within a hundred mike's or something and

like the processing and they were going to do the multi channel but

so there's there's a range of things that people do

do so if we connect up with somebody who was interested in doing that sort of thing that's a good thing to do i

a good thing to do i mean whenever i've described just the people who interested on the acoustic side that's invariably the question they asked if like someone

and because the people always say we're doing very microphone so it's

so maybe it was this month one

and had there's for infrastructure had a very elaborate designed for plugging in filters and mixers and all sorts of processing

seems to me that there's you know they're good political reasons for doing this just getting

the data because there's a number of sites like right

and just have this other information available so

even if we're not video and

see the problem is it took it took at least six months for dan to get together their hardware and the software and the buck and the microphones and the boxes and it was a really big it along

and it was a really big deal

i mean you want actually took you i actually they have multiple channels being recorded so that you can

up we also only have boards that will take up to sixteen channels and

so suppose you can get an array and because there's some person at berkeley's interested in some equipment

and suppose we can has we say that we can you know transferred off to some other place that holds this data who's

this so the depend on the level of group process and you're doing later if you're it's

and so you actually what would want to have a completely different set up and we have one that would go up

have one that would go up to thirty two channels or something

so we're you know four hundred thirty two

we have it's exactly the same problem yes but it's exactly the same problem

infrastructure probably people do you have an infrastructure probably have problem people

so's people getting shy about it there's

is the fact that then if

all that we there will be other meeting recordings we won't be the only placing meeting recordings we were

recordings we were doing what we're doing

and hopefully will be useful

you were here to meeting before i was i was i was here before once so media before actually did you u. redid digit string you and you sign

i was actually did you u. redid digit string

you were here to meeting before i was i was here before once media before

here to meeting before was i was here before once media before

so i did you sign up form you and you sign the form

don't know i'll get another one before the end of the meeting thank you

we never really consent i can't i'm wired and

yes you're on record you're being recorded we don't wired and

you're on record you're being recorded and we don't

we don't perform electro shock during these meetings of usually you can do everyone that's fine

we don't perform electro shock during these meetings of usually you can do everyone that's fine

descriptions pensions

i thought about that maybe three aspect of this so first

seven of our linguists

to them up already finished the days sets

how big is data say and the meetings run you know say an hour sometimes is not as much as an hour and a half

always what i mean is one meeting each person

got their own meeting i don't have any conflicts of you know one just stop transcribing this one or just

you know if we've got two already finished and they're working on it

it right now all leave them have different additional data sets that means potentially as many as ten might be finished by the end of the month

hope so that the precipitation really helps a huge amount and

and also down else's innovation of the the multi channel to hear really helped a lot terms of the court growing up earrings that involve overlaps

but just out of curiosity i asked one of them how long it was taking or one of these two is already finished your data said she said

and all that but it's worth levels to change the things that were mentioned now

now i want to mention d. m. teleconference i had with jonathan just because we spoke

because we spoke for an hour and a half and

and had an awful lot of things in common

he he indicated to me that they that he spend

looking i spending a lot of time with i'm not quite

the connection but spend a lot of time with the out with system and

system and i that's i mean i need to read up on that and there's a

on that and there's a website that has lots of papers but looks to me like

for him to be able to experiment with in this atlas system and they do have some sir

reliability it's like he's really up on these things he's very

so he's interested in the consistency then coding in that sort of thing

i you know at this point i think

adams read more in more detail than i have on this i need to be quite

this i need to be quite myself more that but

myself more that but they there's a way of viewing area

i and that's what i base

is this the project similar and so it's a data representation and a set of tools friend manipulating transcription graphs of various types

is this the project it's sort of between missed in and couple of other places or including l. d.

through them and they mainly had to do with this this cheese structure annotated tree diagram thing

i said you know this way and we

the people the that i have time you what

the people the that i have time you what

i don't think that they're court reporters i don't think they have

reporters i don't think they have a special keyboards not and that type of training i get the sense

so they're hiring and they're coming it's not a service they send the tapes out too they do

i gotcha i see so most of it's via voice reading the train through fourth

to know it's been monologues as far as my just and what exactly

brian himself downloaded so and something c. d. and brian himself downloaded

because you know i mean we wanted to have it so they weren't familiar terms with what they want to do he

so each person gets one of check it and you know adjusted all that

but there could be problems right with that i you know

if you're trying i think it would be difficult to do it that way i really in my

if you're trying to if you got that channel right there really in my case no we're

if you're trying to if you got that channel really in my case

are right there no we're talking about close talking not not the desktop

i think so hope so we really foolish to do otherwise

i i would think that it would be kind of hard to come up with

it's pretty hard to follow especially one side

then they'll switch between but really it i think that might change if you wanted to really find time markings

but really that might change if you wanted to really find

and if you're dealing for the more with a highly abstract network concepts you've never heard of so you

it's historical i mean

sort of we can talk about more details later

because of his knowledge of what the how the data need to be used and so it's useful to

before the that's right friend and we really need to chop things up into pieces that are not too huge

but second of all in general because some of these channels i'd say

a lot of cross some of the segments have a lot of cross talk

it that people were switching microphones around in the very beginning so

yes or i don't know and then you have enough

so we have to sort of normalize the front and so forth and had these small segments so we've taken

so we've taken that and chopped into pieces based always on your you are cuts that you made on the mic signal

and so that every speaker has the same cuss and if

the same cuss and if they have speech and that we run it through and if they don't

it through we base that knowledge on the transcription i'm just on the marks

that knowledge on the transcription i'm just on the marks

the problem is if we have no time mark

then for slang that we actually don't know where you know in the single the transcriber heard that word and

i mean it if it's the whole conversation and we get along you know pick paragraph of talk i don't know how for blank i see

and i think you need to like a

fact that so when jane transcribed and the way she has transcribers doing this weather it's with the pre chuck

then a transcription and a chunk of the transcription that's great

right and it helps that it's made based on sort of curious sticks and human years think the are also

even if we chop up based on speech silent these transcripts from i. b. m. we don't actually know where the words were which segment right

that's sort of why not do the forced alignment that's what you're saying

if you do a force one and on something that really even if you do sixty minutes

maybe they have some you know maybe actually there is even if they're not fine grain maybe the transcribers us and concerns and

great i mean that's a good size could

there was an issue of suppose

in this meeting but that there's and there is one use that we had with them

then it would be very these people be very good to shift over to finer grain coating of overlaps just

just during these more precise timing's

and the third one is just completely wild hair brained idea that i have which

idea that i have which is that if if we have time and people are able to do it takes some subset of the data do some very fine grain analysis of the speech for instance

that's sort of say it's voice from here to here there's

to here there's nasal from here to here and so forth

as opposed to doing fanatic if anything and the phonetic analysis and

say it's extremely time consuming

we could do it on some small subset

described up and just say just pictures

and then this would give some more groundwork for people who were building statistical models allowed for overlapping changes different i mean changes as opposed to just click here now in the state

this is like jest real here now in the state most of to the each sentence on

or is it because you think is a different kind of actual production in meetings that people no i think

and the overlaps just indicative of the fact that people are talking naturally right so

naturally right so i think that given that it's that kind of corpus if it's going to be a

if it's going to be a very useful corpus

if you say we've limited use by some of our censored choices you don't have

you don't have video we'd and so forth but

there's some of the others hopefully someone to make balance that would be really to offer those things that wide range

ten minutes and dude it's markings and then

and then this which for transcription thing i think

i actually i talked to chuck filmar and

chuck filmar and i think they've what vehemently said no before but this

and see if we can try not to convince them because they have something like three or

not to convince them because they have and they have because they have something like three or four different meetings right

exceed non academics you know like government you i don't because you can drive that

know so the problem is so much other is confidential it would be

so it would be very hard for them

is isn't an apartment it does seem like a texas way the demographic and it seems like

is isn't an apartment so it does seem like a texas way the demographic and it seems like

so i actually wrote to him does john how i have weekly phonetics lab meetings if we could get

does john how i have weekly i think if we could get

but i never heard back because we didn't actually

still worth it would be if we got someone other

plus we could also get you know if students and i'm next week you're going to do it all

we could also get you know if students and i'm next week you're going to do it all

that maybe these transcribers could do

because it's i wasn't about why we're so to return just briefly to this question of more meeting data

i thought that all these people had sort so that

already if that's not the case no so there was this thing and so

already if that's not the case no so there

but they have several smaller meetings a week and

so there's the networks group i don't do they still

we might be able to get the administration he was sort of my contact

the administration he was sort of my contact so i just need to

i mean you i see that law has a luncheon meeting and periodical

and this it sounds bizarre but i really

like art humans and or and things like that and so i think

and so i think if there's any like berkeley political groups i mean that would be perfect

i mean that would be perfect some groups

some groups some of it's

some of you know i don't it's really get recorded and distributed

you know with potential i don't think the more political argumentative ones are we willing to and distributed

i'm willing to do to like work to go try to talk to people but i don't really

and i had one that one other aspect to this which is

speakers and he wasn't trying to shape us in terms of what we gather but

gather but that's what he wanted me to show i'm

because yes crawling bush and i think

he said versus but british

different varieties british is english

i don't of english

different varieties of english is english

i don't i don't think he's if you didn't say that speaking

making knowing i remember studies he's knowing the applications he care

they trained done it this is wall street journal days or something they trained

or something they trained on american english and then they tested on

and then they tested on difference native speakers from different areas and

the worst match was people whose native tongue was mandarin chinese the second

so it's you know says that all right and so that would make sense

you know says that all right and so that would make sense
