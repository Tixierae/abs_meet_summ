and you should be able to see which one you're wrong by watching a little far as change
the meeting that's my particular interest is a portable device
i i and the word like go to see or visit or something
really simple that so this is the idea
if you want to actually go hop or into the tower you have to go this way and then
so the entrance could be my as way from the closest point so
twenty some i didn't look through all the data
that was a good year and people
and people when they wanted goto the building sometimes they just want to look at it sometimes
that's something we found just
we may need additional part of speech or maybe just some information on the bird and mulder fires hoaxes aries see
if we feed it through belief in that or something along those lines we get an inferred intention we reproduce instructor that differentiate between the vista of the entire andy tangle malt
but that doesn't necessarily
it's the city hall
i like that like i can imagine if someone came up to me and that's where city hall i might take or are you trying to get there because how i described
and so we're talking about doing it is as the first shot is not doing any of the linguistics
hear the things which if you could get the model spot of the language and discourse and put them into the police that it would tell you which of these three intentions is most likely
and to actually do that build it you know run you run on and dated where you hand transcribed the parameters and
mole by but not with a read wizard system so there were never answers
i i don't know the situation of collecting the data like here
you know intentionally intention can to see what tasks
you get this and but what do we need you know
and it understands you compete that you're
so that's so nancy will have enough at some point we'll have another discussion on exactly that you know how that's going to go
it so that we get some discreet number of teachers so that when we know the values to all those features or as many as possible we can come up with the best estimate of which to be in this case three little intentions most likely
power and then just have a little section your belief that set that was in the
so of the one of the things we want to do is actually pick a package
personally what this could interactive abilities because a lot of what
results in new haven't algorithms go through and run around trying to separate the probabilities for you
and invasive as a platform for a person maybe meet or whoever was interested in doing some linguistics analysis
or we have the full frame that group here
we can see what they have found out about those concepts already
d. on tonnage eat that student is constructing for me back in mel is in all you and it's often x. amount and so that's
that's fine and

if you're not exactly about the region we're not exactly
whether she knows so the question
find that we want the needing to be as natural as possible
the idea is that you'd be able to put a p. d. a. at the table at any impromptu meeting and
and do research like that
we could pursue if we thought it's worth it but i think we really agree on that to come up with a sort of very first crew prototype
i this these intentions we could if you want to call it the vista mode
it just went to get the only you are look at it
but just is something we can set
and then you can all imagine sort of a constraint satisfaction program depending on what comes out
of the time of day matters a lot
but maybe that's a fought state of the system that it's too close to call to do
this is personally really simple case so
it's motions going walking seeing we can m. r. and
with a town hall and maybe saying w. h. focus on the town hall
which was d. h. and what age means
but you don't worry about take the linguistic factors
the with a human operate or
mean you're told when your task is going to go buy stamps or something like that
see but people do there's no so
so when we get to that will have some people doing it know what to do
i every set of having been beaten the details of this kind of thing is that it's one thing to collect data for speech recognition or various other tests that have pretty clear correct answers but with the intention
so what part will have to figure out

they took your give your normal speil
it would always use the closest points to the object and then
and so no it saddam's grab yourself a microphone
that's a question mark i'm not a
somebody has to sue that up later in
it's a grinding because how i described this location probably kind of weather i think i should give them you know directions now or say you know whatever it's half a mile away or something like that
large effect or because they're people ask you where is new york you would tell them it's on the east coast exactly right but
so go back to the that's like
so this is on toys it's not it's about the things they're opening the that's like
so the reason the bullies medicine blue is the notion would be and this may be a bad just
if it turns out that we need data of a certain sort then the sort of data collection branch can be has to do that
data like here it you could imagine them being here around the city it's like one situation then you have
things but you know you got to be something father people to model and
there this is it's that i don't think we did we discuss
you walking food to write a book and i timothy think there may
actually i that was my question is the
so what level of detail that has caused
is a construction or the kind of object or
for but this the bad luck history is in producing x. another content ahead

transcript there's too large number strings on the digits
our intention is to release this state that to the public probably through body like the l. d. c. and
afterwards yes to read some digits
and the source so
we could change on of and any
but now that he may be sent actually now i remember the
there's going to be contextual things are going to be linguistics
things that the person wants to view it to answer it or to tangle with
that would be extremely deep in into and in my understanding so
but if it's the post office you would tell them to get there
they have done some interesting experience of that members as so
i mean you need them both but they're quite distinct
taken into account you're saying
but you don't worry about how to take the linguistic factors how to extract the
have one we can start
on but what i like about it's very concrete we
and see how all hard it is n. t. importantly
choice and there are plenty of people around students in the department who you know live and breathe baseness so

so when you're reading the digit strings the first thing to do is just say which transcript drawn the way we may wined up
so are the people going to be identified by name
so where is that these d. deeper understanding being done like i mean it's
the no actually intention that assistance corporate conduct but they could they call
china for what this mark i'm system without but depending
these we have all these transcripts and
and something by it if it's i believe that's what we'll switch to you know logic or some terrible thing but
terrible thing but i don't think that's going to be the case i think that
that's what we're doing but where your current goal is to
so i think don't know that we are going to actually use this little room and experimental subject
one and then the system breaks down
at the third right then
additionally you so and display you can you said you could you might have a display that shows like
where does mean intended to
to come as close does mean intended to go there to see it and
thing is really close because tango

so actually if you guys want to go ahead and read digits now as long as you sign a consent form that's all right three
so the first step in that in any of these is to collect some data and
just blew it off
if you don't have the attention of entering a building but you know that something is really close to it you just want to approach it's it's too that things consider
i would try to sort of come up with a list of factors that we needs to get out of there and
so this is not something we can actually money for but
so i have no recollection whatsoever really you know i could go back and
so what is important is that we understand what the proposed to ask
and that could be one of the conditional you know
mark i'm not a parsoes
these are all factors that because what he said that we are going to ignore now or that
the third one is too get information on the history of the object
so how should what's d. outside my country go
cases driven ones that you can do learning
containing the data

and so on the far field mice we can expect very low recognition results so he wanted to near
so it'll last person comes and just have them where a wireless it should be on already
forms of speech sherwin signs that if they consent she was pretty
or red limestone
so maybe you would want to touch it
maybe i should go back a couple steps and so no it saddam's
and much we can sort of do if we're closer because at that but they said it was the wrong
we start with
what we do know is that the parts that are used in this market system but never differentiate between any of these so
and the intention this hypothesis they called it intentional that anyway
they called it intentional prophecies so
so do you have to respond to your
do and we will record there's no so just like i figure out what they would

focus on that of ticks down i can
the crude i'm differentiated parse
put analyze speech i think it's they called it really they
instead out come the outcome will be some formal structure
the place i'm that
crashed but you are just you to continue you know the with a human
i don't know you i don't think you really move
i mean that would be and are no mistake that the effort
you might want to be really rather different place and entering it and
it and for an object it's at all big sort of getting to the nearest part of it could be quite different than either of those

the mike here but it's but i'm not going to be on so don't
that's the powder teller
really interesting side
and then these these signs are and pass us that's
you could tell that the do they let the cut out this part because
what tangled mort i
we want to have and structure resulting if we
to do it isn't like if you just talk what the front then gives you and use some clever inference algorithm on it you would be able to figure out which of these is going on
that's way beyond the scope itself interpret interpretation that you know

some and @reject@ you can sign afterwards yes
we think it's a formed starter task for this deeper understanding in the tourist domain
and my idea on how to combine them is with the belief that all may turn
so that may be that for example that knowing whether another thing you
but @reject@ in there they keep it by their lights it
and this that they don't want to see it on the map or they don't want
and as soon as we have one we can start trying to make the first cut at what's going on but what
it what do you guys that kevin yet or not but
this is we all probably have pretty that and the

the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit all the transcripts so if you say
that we're trying to do real meetings
and so we don't want to have to do alias is and we don't want
alias is and we don't want people to be editing what they say so i think that
so i think that it's better just to propose process to edit out every time you bash microsoft
gives us on high quality audio i'm especially for
and shows it too you on the map
right so like the question is what teachers can like we want to try to extract from had a bias or whatever

what we're going to we'll end on them eyes it in the transcript right
but you cannot enter or do anything outside and
we talked this is of course a crucial factor what type of object is this
i think we may be one to ignore it
it that's an idea up for discussion
not important you know i could go back and check
and then covered with time of day this would so that
so that context was like they're presumed purpose context like business or

do some implementation work and do some research and some money thing so
the idea is if you want to go somewhere
so i flipped through twenty some
so that the output of the belief that is pretty formed
and then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things
do different engine machine or
first thing it's just to read the text for burke so just
so just to offer textbooks the tourist guide to familiarize itself but that sort of art sounding german street names like fisher grass and

grab yourself a microphone
i gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it competed different from you want to interest
you know in some pieces believed that could be the appropriate thing to enter
to a place being thrill is the old smart come out but
right and straight in three l. i saw prefers them only markup language so we have that we just a language right
i'm we can produce some if we needed
we needed that's what happens number of things but
so that's part one part two is

the forms so the most important forms the consent forms of speech
so but sometimes the tangle more just really relevant in the sense that if you want to
no let me say one more thing
but to interpret it
we need to do and then we get more whatever part of speech and more construction type like
and then didn't unit can contain it because she's a
so first my country go about figuring out is

i i visit or something
part because otherwise she couldn't get our s. system to take to the people this way it would always
maybe we'll touch it
things consider for example the post office in chicago building so much that it has its own zip code
they you want to call that part of context of the
that sort of they're you see the that of the name
are supposed to i just wasn't so what level of detail that has caused

that was our idea is it helps us to be switched on that's i'm thirty
i'm thirty and i thought they said
and of course the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person ones
sometimes i found in there looking at the data in a superficial way of fun some sort of modify or is that may also give us into and
that whatever it is you're doing at the moment may also enter conspiracy interpretation off the face so
done like i mean it's is it before the bees that is it
and so that's the quote deep that we're trying to get at ann

so just make that your wireless mike is on if you're wearing a wireless check one check
wall but what do the massive do no good
very important and
important and that i've completely forgot that's when we talked this
the map or they don't want to know it's five hundred yards away from you are it's civilian off they want to go there
and the parts or what but

no i wouldn't complain one and then the second
things are going to be linguistics things are going
i missed the beginning but
because you don't have to decide that we is
so our job is to figure out how to solve these problems
know say once we all experts and changing that person for example maybe there's just a couple three things we need to do and then we get

so my particular interest is in the p. d. a. of the future this is a mock
this is a mock up of one yes we do believe
tangled mort i was come up with city names so
so they would get a clearer notion of what input we need but that's what
and you give them this an aurio of some sort
imagine you're the subject going to be in here

because i know you i mean the only way you could get as if you were to give you the six subjects task but where your
and the computer you have you being taught the computer system knows exactly where you are g. p. s. than the
s. than the human operator comes on that person does not know so the g. b.
know so the g. b. s. as so the person
so the person ask sassy where are you
and so you have to do some type of person where you are depending on what you see there

transcript drawn we may wined up with for we need versions of all this garbage
and the pauses just about the person transcribing i can tell where one line ends and the other begins and i'll get all
so he wanted to near field mice to at least isolate the difference between the two so that's why
and then all these channels are recorded simultaneously in frame synchronized
and just make it as a generally available corpus

so you can see the transcript there's
we have we know what the outcome's are going to be
and we have some dated it's loose we can use
it's loose we can use their own intuition
it's so which might be useful too and

the digits do we just read that one and then you
it so in general it's always going to be the answer is everywhere
of object they don't give you any discourse history if you want to keep
so they're quite distinct
she started taking a class last year and then didn't

so just also note on wearing the microphone all you look like
correctly but you want to about two son wits away from your mouse and then
there's other work going on in meeting recording so we're
recording so we're working with sri with you w.
yes just started an effort which will include video we're not

so the other so then in terms of people worrying about exercising things from the transcript it's unlikely since
they took so why don't you tell us briefly your give
video we're not including video
and and then also i'm a small amount of assistance from idea
would be x. email and if you're going off to query to be apology for example you have to deal with its interface

i mean whatever you want to do is fine but we
of action goal and
but @reject@ in there they keep
a teacher now how you determine that is another issue but for
issue but for the current problem would just be if you can be that supports versus a businessman versus the natives or something that would give you a lot of discriminatory power and then just

call my numbers up there any meetings over
afterwards digits
we convince the stock the year with certain how're expressive and talkative you should be but
maybe maybe what you're suggesting is what you're suggesting
those it seems to me those are could you could give no trouble with those being distinct take a picture

if that goes then we can start worrying about how we would extracted
or after the fourth some friends were to go and then
don't think we did we discuss that
the issue is canned we find a way to he tries it so
is a construction like the presence of the word or the presence of a certain stem or certain construction

so the first thing you'd want to do is just say which transcript you're on so you can see the
in frame synchronized silly so you can also do things like being forming on all the microphones and do research
for whatever reason that's maybe what's it made
that's maybe what's it made out of

when you're breeding you don't read into the mike
sort of and so the fact that you're not really sightseeing and just for their for pleasure and so forth
maybe four deep understanding test that's a sort of playgrounds or first to the thing we
and this just look in general is going to be true of any kind of deep understand there's going to be contextual

corpus refer people were more interested in language we want to penalize them by having only thus far afield mike's available and then
main there may or may not
because like we cannot differentiate at the moment between you know the intention of wanting to go there or the intention of just norway to where it is
people not might not be able to for that either i like that

i'm going to leave the mike here but
you have them really view it exploded they bring the thirty years war
it's on the east coast you're more tell them hard to get their you know take that bus to the airport and blah about but
so there were never answers

i except the better filters because i sent
in into and in my understanding so this is the way they might come up if you want especially want to do that you might say at an intermediate step and you believe that is their source pets goal scheming involved
no so it is like someone actually immobile using a device
i'm not it what's mole by but not

and they don't give you the kind of object they don't give
first you have to go find out hard to get to that taste maybe it was the intention
maybe it was the intention of buying stamps and they're maybe's
and they're maybe's next task is to get to set the pace take a picture for your grandchild the

i think we edited it as travel as as the other and contacts like now standing at this place at this time
which is what you have this context in
sometimes some people wanted to see they phrased it more like this but it doesn't exclude
you want to just you know standard think you want stable

engine machine and or something by
in than other factors may come into play the tension for their beliefs that
accept that we may want to push that effort to get information we need
she's got you know some background in all this and

so now i understand the reference of tango mowed that would've
thing is really close because tango
these are not going to get big in these people future
we do one in which it's easy to interact with and modify

one and then you read each line with a small pause between lines
then you should read the consent form but the thing to notice
they're people ask you where is new york exactly

on the speaker form just allies much of the information you can't
to answer that people don't want to enter them
ask questions i would imagine that the day would be really different

no we found or they didn't some experiments that there's three things you can do
you can walk this way income really close to it in touch
and then if you can't do this task

what we find interesting first of all intentions differ
maybe you want to enter the building
maybe you want to see it take a picture

it take a picture of it
or maybe you actually want to come ask if it's possible to the bidding
but that's not a big deal so

they are comfortable
baseball
but depending on these things

and the pace this way you would eat them put these intentions i sometimes expand it couldn't be different i gave an example
or it by their lights it main there may or may not they what we want
if they got a simple as that and the directions

and we get tons of these do i get to i want to go to but also give
the thing we can start at the and sort of look
so if someone says something you could ask them

so all of these things will result in the same x. amount and three have structure sort
and i think the other content has come up before too is if it's
i don't know if this is collected what situation this data was collected it was

and they the i earn i talked about this some on friday
you have to come up with a instead of interests and
of interests and maybe even means of expecting them

so the notion is that this isn't real deep
not from that date or but
or but since we are designing or compared to this even bigger data collection effort and it would definitely take it to put it in there

the two questions is one where do you get this information from into
from into what's the structure the belief that so what are
that so what are the conditional probabilities of this that and the other given these things

it's in general your you know it's going to be much more complex than that
and expanded that to other things like this
but it was never the going of that data connection with the surface set for such a perverse so that's where perk

the parts are put analyze they
suffices and what doesn't and
doesn't and then we can start worrying about where you get this and but

and a said a point there if i understand you correctly
some times people just say things
this you find very often where

context in discourse context which was d. h.
discourse context which was d. h. and what age means
so where would you get this information and

additionally you have a sofa map type display your perspective
have a sofa map type display your perspective put a and so
it was a cover so we're sort of committed to x. m. l. as the kind of interchange

that would've thought it was more holes
like how close because
when you said

so first of all it's about figuring out is
of all it's we either you guys got a favorite belief that you've you know played with bays
with bays were or something

so which is my bio
number one so

begins and i'll get all read did you transfer so you can see how that goes
again i'm not how much i should talk about before everyone here

we can start doing it
than the digit strings this is just a more constrained task

microphone all you look like you're doing it reasonably correctly but you want
another content ahead of course the sex amount d.

this in with this project is there you know no there was
but to all they know the notices great system that can do too

right so if i said hi gerry how're you we're not going to go through and cancel out the jerry but the way i
so we will go through and in the speaker id tags they'll be you know and one of the seven and one away

one and then the second
so anyway she's looking for some more part time work while she's waiting actually for graduate school

and they're lots of different aspects of the project so
up of one yes we do believe that tedious future would be made of wood

is a portable device to do information retrieval one meetings other people
meetings other people are interested in other aspects of meetings

and so what we wanted is a room it's instrumented with both the tabletop microphones and these are
microphones and these are very high quality pressures on mike's as as the

as as the close talking mike's with a close
everything your flying

i'm especially for people who are interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus refer people
it's a grinding large effect or because or something like that

i. digits which is common connected digits corpus so will have some
conduct but they could they call intentional audits but

so will have some comparison to be able to
we can look at some factors that may make a difference first of all

consent she was pretty usual for meeting the people come make so
know i to do it but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it isn't

you guys got an email about this of friday or something about what we're up to
you will not have dirty is and

way and then through some building some stairs and so forth if you
if you actually want to see the power and that's what actually most people want to do is just have a good look of it take a picture for the comedy you have to go this way and go up here

it's it's way too crude too after those differences in intentions
and number and you get a certain amount of staff that you have to solve first you have to go

there and maybe we want to get a switch for the context so
so they have worked very hard it's kind of black boards

things are going to be discourse things and
and they got to be combined

that all may turn out that some different thing is going to work better
the idea would be that new you or

sort of to i'm so this is minutes taking minutes as we go
the anyway so the thing is not usually speaking you've got a for this little test i believe that which

and then the question is
so that's i think why a lot of people doing research used that

but we don't want to do is the bill a system that always ask every time and it
that's not getting out the scientific problem and

saw prefers them only markup language just a language right
the parts are so we have that we have to have a better or of referring to

so they're going to give us some crew or we can assume that you get this crude information
somebody and you see you have to the three d. modeling or the correct time animation off standing in the square in heidelberg so you actually

history if you want to keep that you have to keep it somewhere else
they keep to rafter it

so we can work out terminology later so they're
change but all so liz have offered to help us do this the data collection design and

to be the case i think that if we can get the information i believe it is a perfectly good way doing b. differential combination of
to ignore now or that we want to take into account you're saying

extract it so let's find out which ones we need first speech
no and it's clear from the date like to the correct answer in each case but

what because you can never be i'm even
as possible to it they the terminology we're using is to

perverse so that's where perk some of the tasks we're not differentiated by intention of it too there was no
of it too there was no there's no label you know intentionally

just sort of squeeze that in now
but it's something that would provide some very interested in the for some people i know

the map listen if it did it just trying to figure out how vicious the system is
the map listen if it did vicious the system is

or in both cases going to be your in the computer and the operator can
and were there will be some dialogue so you first

i don't know how much direction is given to the subject about what their interaction i mean they're unfamiliar
i mean they're unfamiliar with interacting with the system all they know the notices great

i'm i know are very briefly nurseries interesting
so anyway she's looking for briefly nurseries interesting

when you said java based but he said you're talking about once and run of coffee know that are in
amount i've no idea whether that's i

know that are in the programming marriage hour know that it turns
marriage hour know that it turns out that there is a you know end of java libraries and it turns out

the obvious advantage of that is that you can then relatively easily get all the other job the packages for grew weeks or whatever else you might want to do
i have no idea whether that's the best choice and

and so that's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries about details about hostels and is going to come from and
deal so in terms of you know changing in and out of any much we build would be x. email and

all right no three digits at the same time out

were talking about doing all at the same time i think cognitive

time i think cognitive lee that would be really difficult to try to read the mall everyone else's grounded need extreme

everyone else's grounded need extreme focus

we have one more coming

and i go ahead and read digit strings can go going

strings can go going from there

mouse and then at the corner

and that so that you minimize press sounds so

so everyone needs to fill out only once the speaker form and the consent form and

and the short form then you should

so if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public which these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them you'll be given an opportunity by e. mail to bleep out any portions you don't like

either so don't worry too much about it's just self

about it's just self rating

should i do you want me to talk at all about why we're doing this in with this project is there you know

let's see out so that's another meeting here

i there's no she got a neighbor and she was notified whether she

since it just isn't that beaded

right so if i said i see the deal but the way i

i don't know a good way of doing it on audio and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data

so is the project is called meeting recorder and they're lots of different aspects

record it and then be able to do creating retrieval later on the meeting that's my

with a close talking like this is some ground truth

and then also it's a very hard task in terms of speech recognition

so that's why we're recording in parallel with the close talking in the far feel the same time

the because the general environment is so challenging we decide to do at least one set of digits strings

to give ourselves something easier and it's exactly the

easier and it's exactly the same digit strings is t. i. digits which is

and read digit strings and fill out the forms so the most

and just can you call my numbers

but we had and we will be using the screen as so

this what was the nature of the now

this was about answering attention from teachers in context and the word like now

filters because i sent it to everybody

i can actually walk for this

do anything outside and it's interesting rock climbing it would three you know quit standing there's just a dark

there's just a dark and they you can touch

and they you can touch it

us that's the street

the street network if our geographic information system

the object and then mentors would be face in front of a wall but

this i means literally trusted it to touch

sometimes it make sense maybe to distinguish there

and there's and nots more different ways in people's the ways people phrase out to gets if they want to get to set the pace

and sometimes here it's a little bit more all s.

and so no it saddam's grab yourself a microphone

you need to sign some and @reject@ you can sign afterwards

that was our idea is it helps us to be

it sometimes they want to enter it sometimes they want to get

sometimes they want to get really close to it

so this is sort of fall people may it may phrase those requests to a a markup system it just the way they did it and

but also give me directions to and i would like to see

some of the things you just don't want to take pictures off

or very rarely

but you usually want to answer them

some updates i'm more dress

more highly full class and of course

into and i'm trying to get to

i need to get to sort of

and this the stretching the context which onto this could be considered

my suggestion is pretty simple

goal and then an object and the source

so i thought maybe four deep

sort of look we need we going to get those and three we have structures the crude

interpret its input

we think it's formed

but it's deep enough that you can distinguish between east three quite different kinds of going to see some first thing

arbor's point is that the current front and doesn't give you any way to know i to

as if as i get i just your flying

that which is going to have this output the conditional probability of one of three things that the person

and you probably need intermediate notes i we don't

notes i we don't know what they are yet

another thing you want is some information i think about the time of day they you want

want and if things are closed

want to answer that people don't

and if it's not obvious you may want to actually point out the people that it's closed you know what they're going through is closed and they don't have the option of entering it

another thing that can come up and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is that another option of course is too have more of a dialogue

and not wanting to do is always ask them that's boring

also be a pain for the person using it someone needs

it someone needs to do is build a little system this whatever got a question like that i got one of three answers have some which one

you want if you want the ability to that you want the ability to ask but we don't want to do

and it's in general

i have my one part to bust first question i

i think also the deep understanding part of it is just going to be in there to the extent that be wanted in terms of all modeling we can start you

we can start you know basic from she would being smuggled that

it's motions going

all of that and then compose whatever inferences so we make out of these really conceptual primitive that would be extremely

and if so is there a focus on thee will or if

or if it was on the path or something

so what would be exciting that information from

is not going to give you what he was saying is the infield does not have any of that

all it has some really crude saying person wants to go to a place being

and the intention this hypothesis intentional audits but that anyway

and that's all they're going to provide

if so someone because i want to touch the side of the powder tower that would we needed pop-up tango mode in that and the directions

we had you in for a source past goal to some degree for it touching decide right

it and somebody has to sue that

maple probably tell you how far away it is at least

away it is at least it's that's even with the baptism ties how

the baptism ties how far away it is and shows it

about the things they're opening times

like business or travel as

i think we edited it as we have all along that we didn't astute distinguishing between situational context which is what you have this at this place at this time

great and what age means

discourse is true whatever

except to find out what seems to be useful so

and this may be a bad just bad idea but the idea

but the idea is to take is the first call see if we could actually build a belief that would make this freeway distinction in a plausible way given

and we're able to by hand extract the teachers to put into place that saying

and see how that goes if

but if we can't do that then we're in trouble and then

the really issue is do what are the factors involved in determining this

know that it's a clear what's going on here

worry about how to extract it so factors how to extract the speech

let's go back to this go back to that it's like they that's the thing up here

let's go back to this go back to that it's that's the thing up here

like mean no know that dado which i

see whether weekend and get so the computer if you've got a day to

from this weekend sometimes you know and that's

you know and that's that but that is not what we need for said anyhow i sort of

but it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it different even if they still in than

i'm even the most smith deliver it just data collection experiment whenever give you data that one if it's like that the tension assess there

assess there because i know you i mean the only

but he we would still get the phrasing all over the place i'm so that's what you want it so you will know

latausha so i think don't know no that's fine i it's just knowing begin tension from the experimental subject

and start recording subjects probably within a month or something so

or something so this is not any look into you guys worry accept that

and one of the reasons why we're recording the meeting for these guys just because we want their help and we start doing recording of subjects

was collected it was is that the one that you showed in your talk

one situation then you have all sorts of other situational context factors that would influence how to interpret like you said the scope and things like that

if they're doing and you know i'm sitting

and you know i'm sitting here with a math and ask questions i

what tasks a. b. c.

people to model and finding out what you know so jewish oakland what the context effects of the situation really are and it interesting thing

some sometime at the moment courteous and i'm it's what to approach it from the and where we can just sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with so they

pragmatic approach

exactly the data collection work

part one part two is you told that this you'll wonderful computer system excessive can tell you everything you want to know

that you're going to pick up the phone down

after the first task

go and then they chewing operator comes on and it's a part of ties us that the system is crashed but

and so you have the same pass again just the different objects

just the different objects

maybe you so as you move through it that they just tracking on the for themselves

invests we

we can show it walks you know we can

you know we can have movies of walking you walking food

you want to go to that place you know and

so we get those names pronunciation it's something we can

it's something we can change that

so you're tasks don't require you to

we what do you what are you supposed to be telling the system

and we will record plus of the river

plus of the river called the wizard or

so you first it through this and that and

is what you're suggesting that might be to pour the data freeze sort of limited to this ping pong one your task is also the question and then there's an answer and the you know the task you want to

task you want to have it more steps sort of i don't know how much

but to some extent this is a different discussion too

so we have to have this discussion of the experiment the data collection and all that sort of and

and we do have a student who is a candidate for wizards

she's going to get in touch with me it's

going to get in touch with me it's just a student of ease

so is she started taking a class last year

she's graduated it because she's a she's

and she'll be in touch so we may have someone to do this and

all this and isn't linguists so

but with the intention it's that there's a lot of other factors and not

factors and not really how the question how to make it at appropriate toy version of that it's hard to meet

hard to meet actually i that was my question is the

that was my question is the intention implicit in this in our i was given

it is if they have these tasks that are supposed to

no one is at the moment

e. the problem that i was going to try to focus on today was let's suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which one way or the other you were able to figure out both contention and set the

and set the context and

context and know what language she's so let's suppose

she's so let's suppose that we can get that kind of data

to come as close as possible to it they the terminology

of object or anything else that's in this it's either in the in this thee discourse itself or in the context

so if it turns out that whatever it is you want to know where the person's tourist or no that becomes a teacher now how

that was in the short run you accept them

and see how it worked and then in the longer run

and then in the longer run you would figure out how all you could drive them from previous discourse or winning anything else you do

of matter which one

you know we don't need one that will solve massive but we can that's quickly these

that's a lot of what it's going to be playing with this

and probably one in which it's easy to have what amounts to transcripts files so that if

so that if we have all these cases

so we make up cases that have these teachers

and then you'd like to be able to say here's a bunch of cases driven

so you have all these cases and their results in new

probably that's not worth it

i mean my is we aren't haven't updated it's good enough to make the these data sitting ones worth it but i don't know

so you got the first task for you two guys is too pick a package

standard think you want stable you want it's

n. t. importantly what intermediate note we think we need

so it if it turns out that just thinking about the probably a couple of things that you really need it you know this is the kind of thing that is you know intermediate little piece in your belief that to be really interesting

and the dog together cosby to become a paper that's going to be published somewhere we sit down and write to and

and it turns out one call java base which is

which is one that hurt people around here use a fair amount i've

right there's a tool kit that kevin murphy is developed

so kevin would be a good person to start with nancy knows about useful too and it's available that lab coat

so kevin would be a good person to useful too and it's available that lab coat

from and so if it has that i all keeper but even if it's a topic that you would definitely be it was a cover so we're sort of committed to x.

fine and

all of these things have been built much bigger projects than this in mind so they
