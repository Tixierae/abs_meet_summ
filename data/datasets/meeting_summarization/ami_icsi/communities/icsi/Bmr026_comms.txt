a week and a half ago and that it's gone out to the transcribers and hopefully next week
so we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical but we are
there and i i can start deleting some because we don't know what the best teachers aren't you won't be using the
i think you need a direct conversation with them and that he's leaving
no that would be for next so we can talk a little bit about that now it's there sometime
their own systems because they're self consistent but
self consistent but certainly to start off when we're trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error rate
so what is the performance the best switchboard system that we've done
the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent here and
i think there's just a whole lot of things that no one ever had time for we never did
had time for we never did really fix up the dictionary we
i think again it's yes a kind of
because it's a pretty good indicator that so to
so to the vicinity check of the canopy outputs before we go ahead and try use them as a basis of attendance
also probably worse i mean
probably worse i mean it's the context independent so no should we bother
so should we bother with using the net before doing and batted training
that's a good question we weren't use that are so they just go straight to
we weren't whether it's worth it to just use the alignments from master i recognize whether to actually
try it whether to actually go through one or more iterations but anyway training where you
keep both versions see which ones

so i think is going to be pretty short meeting because i have four gender items three of them
type of ten
so i think for a lot of reasons i think i'd be very to have this transcriber interface be able to shows some other interesting signal along with it so
for the next meeting might be out of luck with those ten minute
i didn't know you know they've johnson's gone for like ten
i didn't know it left already
it left already tonight
so it's about i think there's about twelve gig last
it and you have the next drives installed liking
and you're all you're offering so i didn't realize it was so critical i
but i've also been throwing up and starting the future files there and i and do and stefan fisk
not for long isn't that x. h. that's like say that's like i have a lot of space i have a lot of space and it's not it's there's very i don't think it was on x. i
the more disk space but in just press prestige meeting saying we need my just base just like
and then the really thing with that is if we combine the two systems we got to one and a half percent improvement
so i said to me the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing it and it's just other aggressive versus because the vacation

that it fish our system first of all with i. b. m. i got a note from brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them week a week and a half ago and that
our system that they finally made the tape for
backed up we're only about thirty percent on all second desk
are we going to get maybe get another rock but you still need to store the desks i see
maybe get another rock but you still need to store the desks and
we need about a gig permitting i don't know what schedule is and just things done i have
maybe i'm confused on long but i mean it's not going it's
what they want that says edmonds would prefer to have one external drive per machine
so they don't want to stack up external drives
and you can probably consolidate them onto larger this and
no but that can't be that hard i mean good short term solution
so they actually have to run a wire somewhere
it all saying is that on all right i'm i misunderstood

three of them were requested by jane who was not going to be at the meeting today
unless that vitamin need in day is disc issues yet again so we're
again so we're doing on backed up we're
also where we started to no
but i won't be getting any bigger i don't think that's on x.
the problem with that is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the exceed
it then you know anyone of these things certainly not a big deal if there is
but they've has to do all of them a big deal if there is a person dedicated to doing it have happened pretty easily but it's never ever everybody has a has
maybe after tea or something you know i can go down and talk to him
meetings so something that we want to do next meeting is two put together kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it we've done
no but i don't need other folks that i mean i can do
so i mean that's actually this would be maybe two hours

and then bleeping out
and in terms of if the off code you confines
no friend in futures you know we bells and whistles
futures you know we did guilty and no caster let's
although and so you know if you're dimensions and the phone sex would be actually helpful just from a logistics
and i think it was again check we should check with and my impression
with and my impression was that when he did that before that had very little using those lose much
by just taking the top whatever
because you know compared to what eric to awhile ago where he trained up i think it just missing broadcast news something

i mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with
in my answer back wizard issue just someone
but i know that generally their and so he always has a lot of plans of things is going to do to make things better in many ways and i rent out of time
desk and so i think what he's been concentrating on is the back but backup system rather than on your disk so
which some but this is a very specific question forming
and i don't think we can solve it here is just asking that we can put some this
here is just asking that we can put some this and not back from there
to the machine that collects the data
that anyway and it's training amaze will test the one you have and see how it's

type of ten jane seems to be moving right along on the transcription from nick seaside jeeze
that's a synthesis tough enough to be transcribed thing so it's only two
you anyone set up
how much space do you need for these
we need about a gig permitting i don't know what schedule is and just things done
just so that's it is this going to be in the morning

but i've also been throwing up and starting t. i next years only carmen and do and stefan fisk
it's probably only about four gig is on x. on your ex drive will definitely too so
more disk space but in press prestige meeting saying we need
that was the interesting and you can't leave out all the conversational data with all of them
so we only for the hot five training we're only using a fairly small subset of the microphone database ever
like it also put so you could be set up and probably do even better

i haven't done that so i
and you're all you're offering i didn't realize it was so critical i
it was so critical i mean i'm not doing anything on it right now until i get new meetings to transcribe that because christians coming and i really can't do anything i'm i just
i'm not going to catch anything i just gave teal some
i'm not going to catch anything i just gave teal some about ten gigs the last ten gigs of space that there was on habit

done that so i have lots of that's just in my own directory try to get
i was the other point i was just wondering because we're running out of be i'm backed up disk space and
the nautilus i mean it's sort of i mean when they're talking about data collection sometimes i you know i'm bored so it's like i
so one compromise would be to only to have the everything up to the point regenerate gladys is because he one system and then
we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were going to do and a lot of them were pretty

and we feel obligated to collect because we get into these other topics
so you know that might be useful for the people who are trained that just to use something other than candidates
they've been using tonight
and that would probably help actually because it's a little different
is and experiment huge difference we made some provinces

i mean since he's a very short that should really be
except but i don't i mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on meeting recorder so if we
i know three digits and go if we could alternate the focus of the meeting
and so but it definitely helps to have the other outdated in there

and also related to the transcription so i've been
it will work but the problem is the version transcriber expose this neck version is one point six whatever and
and my original intention was like we would just delete them and we need more space but unfortunately
are just alternate the focus yes on i mean new every don't have to do it every week we could do it every other week or so you know whatever we feel like we could we right i was one we alternate this meeting every other week but that's what i mean

that's a good point pieces and
i bet there's still some old i like nine gig this around and you can probably consolidate
to talk about but it would be so this maybe the wrong place to do it in this meeting
no that would be for next week it's there sometime

because the sun that the sun blades take commodity hard drives so
hard drives so you can just go out and buy a. p. c. hard drive and stick it in
but it's a habit is going to be hard disk server that house over it seems like we would want to get the second this crack or something
plus we talking about buying a second this foster

you've had an eighteen i had
not for long that x. h. that's like say that's like i have a lot of space and it's not it's there's very
day ago but then they didn't response i don't know how the whole process works i mean does he just
without talking today dave concerned one i think part of the reason why dave can't get the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now we have to rearrange

skip the rest of the conversation
paying them but we could you know if you want to get four discs i mean it's
rate that was a good way to start we're not quite
we're not quite that bad with our support systems but it was in certain areas because it's arrives so what is the

i mean it's small he these things are just two dollars why send
why send that message on to i you and dave asking for if we can get some desk i said
but as a result of you know we were sort of wondering wise the outside system doing so in the business and the reason is
that's so under is brought over the alignments that the or the sri it's

but who knows when that will happen they might be
that's right read speech did i mean show pick one example
which is smaller than the and thought that's pretty interesting so
actually because the fear dimensions it's less trouble probably with as far as just the

or so you know whatever we feel like we right i was one we alternate this meeting
not exactly read speech but it's pretty darn close
and we work together we garnish alignments from decipher
and later we got away from it because once we had decent systems going then it was typically better to use their own systems because they're

in and i you know where we go from here kind of things and
and so that all training that and
and i think it was front and so that would mean this doing the top i don't know ten or twelve or something if the county
of in the base is starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from pretty decent system exactly

that's pretty impressive and so after i told the my comics that's wry about that you know now they definitely want to you know to have it next time
and then i chuck and i had some discussions about how to proceed with it and then system and
it's just a converting those alignment into label files that we can use to train and the that and
so that would give us a more hopefully you better system

is that it sort of i do peripherally
that it fish
it would be if we could i that's work but that's all right because they

because i they're just doing their own thing and so we're doing in parallel
because i need to ask jane whether it's it would be for her some of her people through transcribe some of the initial there we got from the smart come their collection which do short like five seven minutes sessions just doing their own thing and so we're doing in parallel
that then you version is different and

sounds familiar get started and so
the overall they wear the veils i think were slightly better than the females are slightly worse but nothing really i mean
is and experiment huge difference

she's i was going to ask her but she's not around
it but it wouldn't be hard to do
how long is david can become

for held up in this other a little bit harder compass out that's because i think mean i still have high hopes that the we b. m. i. plan workout four so it's
so transcriber is tickle t. k.'s mean we have more windows machines
i got to confused on their three or four meetings

and if anyone objects too much and they can do it instead
what's your computer's name so
your computer's name you've had an it's the most

i going to send out to the participants with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to suggest that it's going to
maybe we could look into that
just record the audio clip and showing image right

to listen to them so the idea that they're going to have access to will that be in compressed version or
i was the other point i'm backed up disk space and
and then one side effect of that would be that it's that this one i would change right

too starve a demo status not much to say the back and is
so might just be flights
so can some of the that i'm talking about somehow fit into this

it's more or less ready to go i've added
to go i've added some that in s. indexes by the meeting type m. r. e. d. u. et cetera and also by the
for the next meeting might be out

too busy so i think dawn and i are going to work on that and you and i can just talk about it offline more
you may not be as that's pretty as we might like go have something i
have something i wonder when we reached a saturation point sort of the

for demo i'm that they get as potential for a little something
i just filled the latest up was that
broadcast news something train retraining them switch partners

i thought it was packaged with transcriber library and so it breaks but
i thought it was packaged library and so it breaks
transcriber but then you kind of at our patches that then

so someone is familiar tickle t. k. has to do it but it wouldn't
but it would almost be like having another way from displayed
read just it just to give us an idea of how the hybrid system would too

do you mean by realtime you mean like being able to scroll through and
more space but unfortunately we're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data all at once and a lot of different ways there's a lot
and put where we can get some desk i said i sent this out a day ago but then

all those need to be expanded and then people
and jane was going to talk too i gave johnson about it one of
i using p. g. i got to confused meetings on their three or four

with them and just can't say it just asking that you know what should you do
so the question is where are you going to hang up
right i don't know what the space situation is in the machine room

one now we have to rearrange of
but we agree that we would have telephone meeting the friday after next
and i wanted to make it after the next one of these meetings so

but they've has to do all of them it's never ever everybody has a
anything other thing i was going to had was that i talked briefly to mari and
to mari and we had both been busy with other things we haven't really connected that much since the last meeting you know here but we agree that

yes on even weeks have basic on data to do that i personally i what i mean
i know three digits and go would start so if we could alternate the focus of the meeting
would start was that and

there wasn't and there's still bunch of messing around with different kinds of those are buses however them so we
them so we don't know exactly which combination we're going to be going with
once we know then that trainable parts of it would be great to run

we made some provinces dictionary it's to the extent about two years ago which resulted
the other thing is dipping deep too history and into a resource management days when we were covering this right before
speech that because our broadcasting systems actually pretty good you know it was

it was i think it was a really key starting point for us that we actually got our alignment and we work
it's yes a kind of these conversational speech that because our
and the other thing that would help us to about it is to see how the p. a straight up right

we've run out of eighty use because a certain number of them are sort of waiting to go to i b. m.
say it seems to me you could do images

so does she for doing something parallel and the rest are in process being transcribed here
no we haven't done so does she have transcribers right now we're sitting idle because there's not that affects from doing something parallel here nope no we're not waiting

familiar and so i wanted to ask jane anyone that this could do i mean since he's a very short
these pages and so that's where i'm putting it but i'll

it's only two channels so it's only it's
so this is a question is pretty hard to solve without talking today dave concerned i think part of the reason why dave can't get

make they're reading and they just
i she's i was going to ask

can you mail that out to the list it's
i that's the thing that i found just a food people saying can you update these pages and so that's where

no they'll have access to the audio also not the only
they'll have access to the audio also

but that is a good point to get to that too
so but it would i mean we could get a map i mean you can do it and number of different places i'm

and also by the user id
that was the interesting thing because that was a right

he actually he volunteered but denny's penny retracted it's so
and also i was just showing address i got i'm an ex ways kind of display and i

so right now it's just an ex ways and we have three
an ex ways and we have three windows but

i've been putting together a transcriber things from windows so
and i saw that on they scuttled p. c. n. and breakfast fine so

anymore but i jobs through an email to the although the snake will find you sent
bill want to put it that way watch a ball game good thing was is here

it's some whatever rep thing and you're
thing and you're kind exit that so you have

so you have to install justin still tickled then install snack and then install the transcriber
and then install the transcriber thing and then

that's just hasn't made is release yet
so did you put thee into the n. t. varies now and the recorded pager

seems to me just it'd be to see it would be
on data i personally i'm not in favor of mummy things

and see the pitch contour is also i think it
but i don't think i you can do all that just adequate in powerpoint i think it was

so now we're kind of on
now we're kind of on the computer and right

ways there are a lot of transcribers there's a lot of transcribers too
there are a lot of transcribers all those need

and then people are doing sean king and i want to do the permission form so i want those to be life
so i want those to be life so there's a lot of data that has to be around

me ten spark blade son blades they so they can in some place they came in the other day
son blades they came in but they're not set up yet and so it seems they came in the other day

one i just hang them off about it is
because there's no more room in the disk cracks on that but there

i mean there are lots of long term solution is what i'm looking for
is what i'm looking for is where do we see expand the next meeting

but i won't be getting any bigger no
i don't think that's on x. t. i next years only carmen

isn't i have a lot of space i don't think it was on x. i
isn't i have a lot of space i don't think it was on x. i

take it up again i think you're right it's x. h. and keep the i think it's about four or five take that's four
take it up again i think you're right it's x. h. and keep i think it's about four or five take

so that will get us through the next couple
you have penalties we need another ticket quad

so it's one point five right yes if being depressed everything it's even more i compressed
one point five or something even more i compressed how much are

like thirty some day of just meeting so
including are together set and you and not all of no it's

think because we have the i compressed around also so it's like right we
so it's like right we haven't been compressed all the meetings but

we can easily get one four discs i mean you just got good
so just a week from tomorrow that would

it's just it's not on the net so it's a little all cord the only what do you not on the net
little all cord what do you not on the net

allow any services through except s. h. because it's in syria machine
and also on the list is to get it on the normal like seeing that but

eleven days or something
tomorrow and all weekend

jane i think i know jane may not be
i think i know jane and what

see the so it's like i can sympathize with them not wanting to be you know if i could get out this could
they there's one thing i mean you don't want to overdo it because every friends and you know if you

every don't have to do it every week we could do it every other week could we
we could do it every other week or so you know whatever right i was

with investor over which is like our new and improved version of for over which
so of for over which actually uses the whole investments from both systems

to have it next time we haven't even nation they want to do you know the kid at least assist in common
you know they're right is half of what you do if you train onianta attend that not to metallica digits which is only

fifth of it just how much it the rest is red timid
fifth of it just how much right but if it the rest is red timid they'd and it just and and lots of travel and like that

we never did and never did any adaptation even that's number
and that number i think wasn't switchboard one day right

they right now it's in the twenty
so we're we're probably at least a factor too often so the so it would be

so be first was transcription status does

status does anyone besides j. know what the transcription status is

and hopefully next week will have the transcription back from that

i think about two and aren't that nick seaside jeeze assigned i think probably five or six more meetings

i think about two and aren't that you know something more meetings

you know something which meetings so i you tired some new transcribers and

which meetings she transcribing and

so does she have transcribers right for doing something parallel here

no we haven't done that process so no we're not waiting on them

no we haven't done that process so no we're not waiting on them

that process so they're doing the full transcription process they're on them

i doing in parallel

right again we have a similar logistics set up where we supposed to send the data to munich and gets inscribed

right and gets inscribed and get back

sounds but to get going we would like some of the data transcribe right away so we can get started

it's only two channels

so it's but he one china to transcribe it

so that should one session and so

so that should have made too many fewer

and it's also not a bunch of interruptions people and all that right and some of it is

and all that and some of it is read speech so we could give them the thing that they're reading and they

workout four so it's

so i've been trying to keep the web page up to date showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we've collected and

can you mail that out to we've collected and what stage each meeting is in terms of whether it's

these pages and so that's where i'm putting it but i'll

i haven't i'll send it out to less time people

so jane also wanted to talk about participants approval but i don't really think there's much to talk about i'm just

no so but it's trusted friendship's not the only

i mean that's my attention because the transcripts so

because the transcripts might not be right so

so you want people to be able to listen to them so

that's a good point compressed version or what you have scripted like and compress the various pieces and

that's a good point it's probably going to have to be the young compressed versions because it takes too long to do random access decompression

that's another agenda item i was another knocking how late

the back and is working out fine it's more or less ready

so that the friend and can and do filtering based on that as

the back and is going more slowly atlas i think i said before just because i'm not much of a tickle t. k. programmer and

and they've gal bart says he's a little too busy so i think

but the back and was pretty smooth so i think we'll

smooth so i think we'll have something you may not

point sort of the involuntary for everything and

i said he was too busy i

kind of display and i don't know how much more we can do with it with like

we can do with it with like the person like for we have like style eyes pitches and signals and the transcripts in the bottom so right now it's just

windows but i don't know it's pretty i'm that

sounds good something for a demo

so again the issues for july is going to be what can we fit into a windows machine

fine so hopefully it will work really so that because

because there's some people it would be

so transcriber is tickle t. k.'s very generic with snack so mean we have more windows machines

with snack so anything you can get snack to run on it will work but the problem

whatever and that's not anymore it's pulled it's not

it's pulled it's not on about page anymore but i

the snake will find you sent me know one point six whatever library and so

you confines it took defies anymore it's some

patch thing and then do the patch i

patch we have the patch i wonder if we should contribute dollar changes back to the author so that they maintain those changes along

no i haven't done that yet and

it's ask if i was a planner files whatever representation

it's away form and stylish pitch factor so it's

so i mean we could get a map i mean you can do it and number

it'd be easy enough to add that again it's but it would be if the transcriber interface had like another window for the you know maybe about the way for them when they show some arbitrary valued function that is you know times thinker that i tight times thinking it's with the way form i'm that is very

it'd be easy enough to add that again you know times thinker that i

to add that again it's it's more tickle t. k. programming so someone i tight times thinking it's with the way form

it doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary say it seems to me

what do you mean by realtime

you mean like like being able to scroll through and for the demo

and to hear it see it would be like to see he'll and see it and see the pitch

to hear it and see it

just record the audio i mean right

just record the audio clip and showing image i think that's right i just got few human

i think that's you know what i just got few human side i thought you meant like just would you grass or something

the computer and i think when we were talking about this before we had little this little demo meeting right

you sort of set up a range of different degrees of life mess that you could have and

have and the more lives a better butts given the crunch of time we may have to retreat from it to some extent so i think

right just looking for ways that we can actually show what you're doing

it's a lot of the ticket for communicator that's certainly significant chunk the things we've terms about originally had to do with preside

to show that we can actually kept him in

but we are like ninety five percent ninety eight percent on the scratch desks for the expanded meetings

johnson about it one of the things i was thinking is we just got these hundred our excuse

up yet and so it seems to me we could paying scratch disk on those because they'll be in the machine room they'll be on

room they'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines and

and if we just need on backed up space we just hang discs off them is there

the sun late have spare right days

until you know you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes

all right i have i have an eighteen gig drive singing off my computer

you won't be using the old ones

not for long that x. h. that's like say i have a lot of space and it's not

that's like it's there's very little enough for

it's probably but i'm using x. h. too so on site it's not going it's not being used often at all

it's probably but i'm using x. h. too so site not being used often at all

drive will definitely take it up again i think you're right it's x. i think it's about four

h. and keep the i using p. g. i got to confused or five take that's four meetings on their three or four

i got to confused on their three or four meetings

it should just be a i should have a button

we've collected so far something like sixty five meetings

and how much is each meeting take about a gig

and how much is each meeting take about a gig on compressed

and so they live in morris i usually don't doing on compressed the all of the p. m. in the p. d. a. things so a little more right yes if being

one point five or something even more i compressed how much are they like

so we're definitely restoring you know all those

there's a hundred cake or something of just meeting so

i mean it's they really are cheap i mean it's just

i mean it's just a question of figure where they should be paying them but

so i was assuming he was going to take over that but

i think over that but he's probably too busy given that he's leaving

i know so i mean i think to what you want to do is plan has a little bit and secure here's what we of grand doing for the next few months

i know what they want that few months

and then they want everything else in the machine or

one thing too and to to do when you were need to consider spaces i bet there's in the machine room right now we have to rearrange of

this and you know her the space

i know i think they've done is always things person and

but i know that generally their first priority has been for backed up this desk and so i think what he's ways and i rent out of time

i mean you just got good for and got the money for it's no big deal

but the question is where they go

so then you could at least temporarily star they're

it's behind also firewalls that don't allow any services through except s. h. because it's in syria machine

will happen no the problem with that but that can't be that hard i mean they might be good short term solution

but i agree i think that there's a longer term thing in his immediate need and i think we need to

and i think we need to a conversation with

they just sort of bullet eyes or you don't that don't i can dream of tax but is going to lead to the annual report so

is the fifteen so

so just a week from tomorrow that would

or because you know i find if i have to leave around to

is that on yes what i meant i'm i misunderstood i thought

yes what i meant was on the made this meeting if i was something i'm making major thing in the engendered as i want to help in getting together a list of what it is that we've done so i can tell or i think i thought

or i think i have a pretty good idea but

and then the next day and in the day i'll be having that discussion

i'm one thing i mean we in past meetings we had also a very talk about the work that it was happening to us on the recognition sides but

sides but this in this survey related to meetings specifically so

specifically so and i wondered whether we should maybe have a separate meeting

between you know whoever is interested in that

because i feel that there's plenty of to talk about but

i'm interested it's that going to be very boring for people who are not really interested in the details and like nuisances

so how many people here would not be interested in in a meeting about recognition me too

know if we talked and what do you mean in a separate meeting or talk about it in this

know if we talked about it in this meeting so about it in this you wondering how much overlap there will be

about it in this meeting so you wondering how much overlap there will be

lives in saying

lives in saying probably

bill good thing was is here

you know real man real men do decoding or something like that don't listen to this list

you know real man don't listen to this list

can sympathize with them not wanting to

see the better developed feminine side could

i would be a lot of police in this not i want

it's nearing the end of the week

i know i iverson like i said that could be

we feel like we one we alternate this meeting every other week

are just alternate the focus but that's

basic to do that

except that we keep going for full time and so if we did that because we get into these

we feel obligated to collect more data other topics

would start was that and then if we find you know we're just not getting enough done there's all these topics

was that and then if we find you know we're just not getting enough done there's all these topics not coming up then we can expand into another meeting but i think

meeting but i think that's a great idea

sad about it with us and jane get you if they think that would be good i mean andreas

that would be good i mean andreas and i have various talks in the halls and

in the halls and has lots of things

in the halls and has lots of things you know details and that i think people be interested in and i you know

and you're attending d. the fun in meetings so the other so you have probably one of the best even i

bridge even i have them in the mainland to sort of see the bridge between the two we are doing recognition

we are doing recognition and

i'd i tested the so the final version of the yuppie configuration development tested us up for this year's applies to set

and be recognition performance was exactly i mean exactly up to the you know the first decimal famous with see cuts to friends and for both females

yes for both females and males

really i mean definitely not significant and

and be but a person has

that's pretty impressive and so

clearly going to add a few more so

clearly going to add a few more features though so

what any more teachers

no what any more teachers in the sense of funding features are and since it's just bells and whistles

no caster let's you know try ross an m. s. g. and i mean right so

you know if you know you if you multiply effort by and number and it's a number of different systems in

system and then after that to re score lettuce this was the multiple systems and

multiple systems and combine results and that's a fairly painless do you think

i do you think we'd still get the one and a half so

maybe less because at that point right so lower and so

you know maybe it's only one percent or something but that would still be worth while doing so

just you know from what you know that's working out very nicely

and then we had some results and digits we so

this was run it really so that's just to get days going with this experiments

right including are and the reason is that there's a whole bunch of threats each data and how five training set and

not all of no it's actually did this is only maybe if so of it the rest

so i mean that's actually not that different from on the training and so but it definitely

about two hours something

and more read speech that definitely helps and you can't leave

thing because it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data would be better but that was a right

would be better but if they're even more

but so if they're even more read speech kid ever

like it also put in bogus condition zero from hope before from burqas news which is mostly prepared speech better

no i mean if they never read speech did i mean

they experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with french and spanish and so forth because they're multi lingual times and

and and actually the best results they got we're using tonight

if we knew what the structure of what we're doing there wasn't

system and you want to tennessee that's i'm so under

so the m. l. p. would be trained on i think only forty six forty eight

just you know we want to try things like dealt us on the attendant teachers and so

and so you have to most everything but two or three and so you know

although we i mean it's not that many fewer and we take k. l. p. anyway so we exactly so that was

the other thing and then we want it to is just limited to maybe something on the same order us dimensions as we use in this and it's front and so

once we have the new m. l. p. train up one thing i wanted to try just for the fun of it plus to actually run like standard hybrid system that is based on you know those features

kind and retrain m. l. p. and also the you know the dictionary that we use for the five system

but he i think he didn't he probably didn't use all the training day that was available and his dictionary

that's and his dictionary probably wasn't as humans too conversational speech is as a horse so

that's certainly one thing is so and experiment

which resulted something like a four percent absurd

and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did but that's

we never did and never did any adaptation but that's even that's number

so we're we're probably at least

so the so it would be good to let us read just

that's a good question we weren't use that are so they just go straight to

better i mean i agree with i mean you would then

i mean you would then you perceive is even better training

even better training i take a while chances that anyway and
