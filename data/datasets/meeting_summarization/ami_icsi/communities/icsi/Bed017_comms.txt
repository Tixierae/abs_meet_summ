still do doesn't matter what time i should come a long time ago i mean like two weeks ago
doesn't matter what time i mean like two weeks ago
i was actually oversight but anyhow
so we had a meeting for awhile and
remember running to bring us up to date on where we are with you
she's actually suggested to look and the psychology department students because
because they have to partake in two experiments in order to some requirements
so they have to be subjected to before they can actually graduate
on yet but i think i have the info now that i need
that's done and i am meeting tomorrow so
doing and why it is somewhat religious
and for each site you know what how this fits and
this fits and a rating of how it fits in what to do with it
the one of the things he was do this it was just the fact that
the people at stanford write papers is if they had
so are they the plan is one definitely gets back we'll get in touch and supposedly
are looking at that most of the work here is josh train to get the frames right this linguists
you actually do an old noting grease expect one person that you send over here and i'm right
spotting just that it's coca that would be a very

like i use your closet psych class and you know what time around and a query class
the red lines on the graph of the relations between that different classes like
the special needs and you know money and use and trish
this is more or less similar to the flat base that they have you know what the input notes and all that and
a lot of the i got from the flat based not on what they depend
actually you know classes with different attributes that are they intermediate notes and
notes and one of them is like time afford ability money if what abilities site availability and the travel compatibility
and so some of these classes are
or it's just from i don't like the site
but if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors you need to look at a pair of you know what that preference of the user is
and they all get the same users but different sites and that makes it
i'm very coarse grain so you have something
grain so you have something like science biology and but that's

as force marked call i'm that last like a meeting i mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis which as
so maybe and when tomorrow is over we're done
the p. r. and because then you have one user optics and potentially
and they can blame the computer to the book exactly
so maybe just a little background on my visits home
the reason this really for me toughen up tunisia talk to some of the research is in the field and then
in the field and then saw just sort of give you a real quick introduction to what i'm working on and
filler admit you're interested in and sign up more and then
what's sort of the state of the art there is to the you have a bunch of the documents are learning units ordering objects
and you store meditate on associate with and so there's some international

one of his many occupations that just contributes to the fact that he is very occupied
try to simplify down a little bit so that i can actually
so that i can actually look at it more as a same paper
that i think was actually in the previous be who wouldn't stop i don't remember
stop i don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not
so this and they're is the follow you're working for this project and you under certain problem now what
sources and sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community came up with
carries you can have the best learning system with the best search interface if
wondering if i were student i'd love to come here for person company

and so you know it's easier to specify d. c. p. t. you know
so there are some you know collaboration elaboration of this
structure but i don't think it's worth it now because to
and but that's pretty all that we have at the moment so i think there's a huge
so i think there's a huge the need for improvement there now with
so what i'm what i try to do is to have so
because you know standard stories that she works keywords revoke frames and the frames and they will give you additional keywords or
and when we have all the sponsors that always of eager to get some teams but i know
to be semantic web workshop in two weeks right and

but you have to have a genuinely
but you have to have a genuinely funny before you'll get an example
maybe it'll take some more time
you might tell us a little bit about what he's actually doing and why
a user has like very
so anyhow using those indimedia notes then this would be the class that me immediate notes
it's sort structure uncertainty
and then the sort of an add on to this whole idea the book be

so when you said interest i thought you were talking about stalking and
so i tried it constructed dependency models and
maybe what's the background of the students
side that's that's one of the things that might be worth looking into while you're here
unfortunately screamy who is heavily involved in them all and all this sort of is himself out of town
because he did some work on topic spotting just that it's coca that would be a very

anything else i missed
focused again
home i'm not really involved in any project that's that's relevant to you at the moment the
so if i knew which operating system the person was working on with this improve my search or something
and so what i'm what i try to do is try to model this in a way that you could really combine knowledge from very different sources and
so i think you must be able to re use some existing the main information or on policies that other people wrote and try to

it's got a laptop just kind of showed
which as a this morning should be results
should be mean stay on yet but
and it but never have it again
in touch and supposedly will actually gets deep connected to there are working

and probably won't have one next week i think a number
in the expression weather for instance and faster
it wouldn't surprise
notion of an stench aiding you or a woman's problem uncles and it's very nicely and doesn't it and that
and that was one of the main reasons

that so the data collection as force
look at the p. r. and
and that makes it seem they're a little different in the p. r. and because
you should be able to accidently try to solve problems and
of take care of this and so what i want to build is smarts s. e. q. system

because it's all from the user size if you change
if you change she you can you know say some work on that
and boppers are with not much cleaner
and they can blame it to say you don't have to fight about this just give your preferences to the
in much of that in the as a matter of fact the only thing that really works out so far our library ordering coats which i'm very coarse

somebody with it you know if it's a group meeting once a week probably someone will go down whatever so we're
good does my job for and you wanted to plan something that some hall with some pre go up the mole thing for
and find out which which questions are worth asking and that's
way now the big problem that i'm facing right now is it's fairly easy to pack up the system it quickly that works in the small domain but the problem is
i i'm trying to think of how it maps to the kinds of things that we talk on this group and actually associate groups of some

because there's and then place it's assumption behind it this that's
i think that's a very that's a key point of the systems and the sort of
but the problem is the scale ability
and it's robert was mentioning earlier today is that mike suffered something with their printer setup program has bayesian network which is exactly
trying to have an approach how to integrate certain representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules

know what you need to do here if you need to provide some context information which is
need to tell you this i'm you have the same when somebody out there sentence in a certain context it's
have that in the previous in bun small difference in a way is that he doesn't have to come up with an answer but she
documents that have the answers an answer but she wants to point to the places so i'm not i'm not building an expert
so i think that's this crucial for the success of or

action i like to spend on your
to find out some more and then maybe i'll just walk around the office and
and these shows are pretty straightforward you have to offer information have size information format information and so on but
and if you have a question about homework it's probably makes sense that somebody was in your class with you was sort of to grow in a certain area

i don't know to look at the next page he should be at least
on what they depend on and
i do that so i try to see if i can do putting the computational notes in between
yes is an interpreter looks like what is it you should be able

form of this and that will be done fish these once we're done
actually i had to go the complicated
analyses and i'm guessing that you won't be doing that sticking no
that would be a very good idea

versus you know what type of an event it is or
and then plan a robbed
it can go all the way back to the very top
that so you could talking about you know both of those things at once

was you know references to the user and the site and the time
so instead of doing all of you know competition about you know which one sided once months to use an once of his it out cup up try to come up with like sort of a list of sites
and there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a peer to peer approach we're
until these guys never

christmas was nothing easy right
and that's what i then probably get back to the user and sort of tried
now depending on what the search engine or the content depository depending on which which rules and which apologies it uses are it's view of the world you can get very different results so it's like they make
so it's like they make a lot of sense to actually korea a lot of different search engines

which i think you're also looking into right now
and interpret it in this case
happy occupations which and no i mean it you didn't but what he did was much more so sensible from
are being recorded right nurse or

i don't know i mean that right i mean i had forgotten about to be
i don't know i mean that right i mean i had forgotten about to be honest i forgot we had a program
it's in the program i think it's
i think it's more the lack of students really and when we have all the sponsors i know

holy macro
and using this in some knowledge about the domain i think you can do some simple inferences like you
like you know that when something's working about working on service for example he's

and can be looked at if you're interested
we want to design it so that they really have to think about having sometimes two days
tests or did you ever ride up in enough to read it and

something happens and you go outside it the p. r. i'm that we're going to look at today and
that would be expecting to start with
context it's and then the same sense another context makes a huge difference so i went

for me i and into asked i think you've met everyone except nancy i i
kind of talked about that but we haven't worry too much about that end of the discourse and maybe guys
discourse and maybe guys have that in the previous in bun

so my age scientific director of the e. mail is also did dean of the international university one of
it's only like user
and potentially you can have many different sites in mine

some of these attributes only depend on from say the user or it's
if we got and there were a couple other ideas of things for you to look at
groups of some of us do pretty detailed linguistic analyses and

i'm i would have been trying to see whether the p. r. m. would make it more efficient if we do everything like that
i you end up having fewer number of notes in a flat base net because otherwise you would
as mesh before were pro at to do tests or did you ever ride

that trouble planner should be able to take it from there
and you know with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever
something i remember them learning when you know the structure for but i don't remember

until then will come up with this something that's way more complicated for you
documents that have the answers places so i'm not i'm not building
but i just i'm a little surprised that invested didn't come up with anyone else

does my job for official thing for
then we can move on see what i'm dresses got honesty
so for having me here first of all

except for humans can't really felt it either so that's but if something you would say or right
true the idea was area
true experts in that there as

up more and then the have to talk to you and
and use this as a metric in the search
what i envision this but you rather than just playing a bunch of keywords you could for a friend i think you for somebody could state sort of like a logic conditions when this document applies to this

the systems and the sort of always pressure over this real quickly without really elaborate in much of that in the
some work willis got the same answers without
the same answers without a couple of be to have a system that could sort of take care of this and

like that now you using this you can in for more information and you could then
and you could then matched us to meditate off off the documents you're searching against
so what i want to do is have some sort of given these inputs and then i can compute

as i assume that that will be learning systems that attack they're content
so something very specific that you can then
but the i think that the key point with these learning systems is that learning system is only as good as the amount of content it carries you can have

up something quickly but it maybe then make sense to me but not to anybody else and
the other know anyway you'll see certainly see long
and you know like taking the date and so you said the learning systems that figure out we either

they had just started transparent him yet know just talking to this day with action what is it and he explained to me i like to spend on your
and he explained to me

he should be at least you still set aside a lot that you're on jokes
it's a different last

one next week i think a number of people are going
sometimes two days for example and certain

in a smaller group we had talked and decided about comes communication of the data collection
so face time with us this almost officially over

because there's another entails around so
and eventually i'm meant that to me whether they open at this are not

that would be right off park
at it more as a same paper that goes to your time

and wasn't enough of an update
and my daughter short procedure

so this is sort of like the latest thing i have on it
and so i ended up making several classes

so i took a lot of a lot of that decision notes
like do you share

and then said that the red lines
on and turns out you know the c. p. t. to really big if i do that so i try

and what that would look like in a p. r. m.
rather than going into some yahoo like search engine

be able to be used like all the user and
all the user and not having to recruit people a lot of those because it's all

and it it's just another class in the model was you
no the dependencies would of the various would be reduce it thus and so you know

so i think that's about as far as i've gone on the p. r. and
you can get tell us what the output

so what other questions you know about the and just
we are going to build our own interpreter so if we can't find

and ability was can shave instances people and sites and will help in the expression weather
information i think there are things

without going this incredible hacking sort of
sort of green building it on the line notion of

people saw that problem like robert
it looked to me like if you were able to come up with a you know value for each of the number of sites plus the t. v. a. thing

i think basic leave them too similar things
some of those things might that might be different movie like is it the hours for this site and

and status would be you know more
and status would be you know more or less like was and the construction in

it's sort of in the definition or and deafness definition of a p. r. i missed it
using which homework assignments or she working at the moment

p. r. i missed it passing relations and you
and i some questions and then a couple of days i'll be here for

relations and you know c. pictures of the classes and the relations
which chairman such with encountered

for but i don't remember reading how you specify
that would be expecting my question probably to start with

we get roxanne eroding on this again once we get a package if when
then this becomes full grown it's

and sewage
so they some of the just system with honesty ideas and i think a lot of

but what the pet potential results pizza to split up and never talk to each other again
information which is more elaborate than i'm looking for this and this keyword

to what i'm working on and i just hope that you have some common filler admit you're interested
so i went to be able to model information like so in the concepts off in the context of developing distributed systems of the computer science school

document and one is you have sort of
what it's talking about so that some sort of texan on like ordering off the off to you and it's now

now what we have it our university quite a bit is that students tried to programs certain assignment for some that was
not very useful so i think ultimately it because and developing these rules and these inference inferences i think is very costly so

and always come running to us and i say what's up
and i say what's up some work willis got

and i think it i don't need to tell you this
school what kind of suffers the person using which homework

we somehow need to have formalized way of writing this down and that's
and that's where the shared interpretation off of certain terms and keywords comes in again

for example he's using java concerns used written in java some inference
some inference like that now

so it seems like a lot of some of the issues are famous i know about i thought
documents that have the answers places so i'm not i'm not building an expert

to you also don't have to figure out in europe is still understand what the contents s. about itself and then match until what you think the information and it's
to you also don't have to figure out what the continent you're just taking think the information and it's

people wrote and try to integrate them and then
integrate them and then also search the entire went around and just a small content management system

on the other hand friend that could be useful so do you have the friend
so do you have the friend that story

keywords or if i do know that a bunch of keywords indicated frame then you can find documents and actually if the whole frame rather than just did you so there's a lot of
that so you could talking about you know both of those things at once

this linguists and there's a lot of
it and they're busily working away

but there are some application efforts trying to split it
i'm i could learn a lot and it's just it seems to me that this is a place where you might be able to do that

this is supposed to an exchange program and i we
and i we don't fight we don't care but i just i'm a little

i didn't say anybody to anything to offend except for sponsors
except for sponsors maybe

for some reason he's not doing
the other person i thought i was daniel day because he did some see long

they had just started transparent him yet know just talking to this day with

holy macro

and she brought us some study subjects and protected today

protected today and ten that have been transcribed and can be looked

at if you're interested in

and we found another caucus i student was interested in playing with her too far us

they're going to make it a little bit more complicated for the subjects this round she's

and certain things and figure out which can be done at what time and

like it's the whole thing and everything if you are more complicated structure

but induced where we seen the end of the time that

don't think we need to discuss this form of this and that will

we have a visitor from books out from the international university and into asked

so some confusion

and but using maybe some of the same technologies that we are using

so it's just been looking at

i of constructed a couple of classes like i use

and then also has you know reference off too it's preferences

or you know what form of transportation the user has

and whether you know on site parking matters to the user in that case

for each of the site you'll come up with this rating of travel compatibility

because otherwise you would

in the case right it depends on both the user and the site then i'm still having a hard time trying to see how using the p. r. m. will help

and then after group them together this no the

so it only makes two decisions in this model and

one is how desirable site is

being how could it matches the needs of the user and the other

and the other is the mode of the visit with it

the visit with it's the easy a decision

so that was pretty questions

pretty questions it's not a little write up on it

it robin williams

no not the we look at all you have to see if there's anybody has a implementation

so anyway so that's major opens yes

problems and they do it

i actually think that is cleaner and

i think there are things that you can express this way would you can't express a normal belief that

certain the computing at some

at some beauty towards we're in good shape

these these but we when wendy's terrorist and she did they take on the same values that we had before or me

we had before or are they changed i think

i thought question i would have is said presume up from the way the stanford people talk about it you can afford probably which is also on the relations

which is a structural uncertainty

uncertainty or

so we're actually figure all this out

i think that long-term perspective is pretty clear

because i made a really complicated in the beginning and

you could from this go on and say suppose there's a group of people traveling together and

except for humans can't really felt it either so that's but if something you would say or right

that would be good enough you could sell it to say

that you could try to put in to this structure but i don't

in the interim

i'll be here for tomorrow and the ranger of next week

so what i started looking at to begin with this just content management systems in general so

so there's some international standards like

standards like i tripoli but my triply l. o. n. standard

but they're too fields that are more interesting one is you historic

one is you historic keywords so she's would be with the document and one is

off to you and it's now if you sort of put on your semantic classes you say that's not all that easy because there's

it this that's all the uses of this system share the same interpretation of the key words and same interpretation off which ever to economies if you spend the

now with this standard like this what gives us this week it's sort of with the search engine just corey different repulsive towards all over the world but we can't really

for some that was friends at the same problems and

so the surf information i think should be transmitted when a certain documents for treat

giving this so we somehow need to

inputs and then i can compute how many documents match

know what i plan to do is someone to sort of do it try to improve the quality of the search results and i went to do this

and i went to do this by having it that's escapist descent approach so if

search or something and having symbolic formalized models dislike it said to compute that and

and sort of tried to optimize the searching this way now the

this but there you face the problem that these are very hard to expand and so

but i'm also looking into is the probably the sick approach into this because documentary people's

documentary people's very fussy procedure so it's probably not that

so it's probably not that easy to sent have the symbolic computational models detect

models detect all probably and expressive enough so

enough so that's another thing

we're also discovering around our individual bookshelves and

and i think a lot of even though it's a very different still may think a lot of the issues are fairly similar something

so some of the i don't know how much you know about the larger heidelberg project are you i know

famous like you know the context based factors influence how you interpret

interpret it in this case of friends were in knowing one you know what kinds of things to ask we've

of things to ask we've kind of talked about that but

an expert i want to post smart librarian they can point you

they can point you to the right person so i don't

to the right person so i don't want to compute dancer so it's a little

so it's a little bit easier for me

what the continent you're just taking the keywords is the topic taxed as i assume that

document applies to this document explains how to set up your email accounts on line up for something like this

search interface if there's no content side of it's not very useful so

so you take very and

a rough over you so that's another thing you might want to look into while you're here

that people are looking at that most of the

i'm i could learn a lot about it's how to to come up with these structures because it's

these structures because it's very easy to whip up something quickly but

to anybody else and if we went to sharon integrate things they must they must be defined

the pressure persons story right

and i'm chris and i tried to come up with a we had come up actually with with him working on the interface frame that is the worst back and that would bird with some of the work for this machine right

which i never got them person to happy occupations which and no i mean it you

but i just think the we had that idea you know the idea was area

interesting information extraction also right

so you guys never sent anybody else my you

except for some you were you know

program i think it's really the lack of students anti you at the moment no there was no whole caught there was a little contracts

anti you at the moment no there was no whole caught there was a little contracts was

in two weeks and

the other things too and what he said but i'll i don't know anyway

which is i mean you maybe i don't depending on how you want to integrate with that and you know like good idea

that figure out we either someone and if you're actually working on has worked on that kind of and he's worker from

of and he's worker from that so you could talking about

and he just finished writing it got to the thesis of
