are there or not at least that's my current working hypothesis
talk about a good noise shield you
practically so
i since i've been gone all week i didn't send out a reminder for an agenda so
i wouldn't mind hearing how the conference eyes what kind of friends kids to go
up here so but and also breaking very is actually flying from the east coast on that morning
they would be that's easy for them to
he sees he generated that we've kind of up to the point where we can actually give it i b. m. and try it out
of what point
and i'd as far as i'm concerned spun base in mexico this point and that's
are you talking about visually i just don't think
very quickly you can't but it takes time the problem is that tickle t. k. interface
it takes long enough takes on it good s. it's very so
four speakers and you know you could fire up the transcriber interface free you know in different windows multiple ones one for each channel and a sort of a
and have a starting with next and
did you run these under the sri recognize on the is listen to it i thought
since i consider those living area and
which must have been
some problem i can't imagine what is half
just imagine what is half of what i mean by pathological science
i just haven't listened to it yet to find out what it was so it takes good that
footwork on it yet to find out what it was so it takes good that pathological ones by definition those that had like over ninety five percent right and the tomatoes then the adversary was like one point four or something
did you have them something and report about four forced alignment have
and more often than not it gets it wrong
but the first word forty says often high but it's
that's just aligned to the beginning off someone else's each nothing it's
the short mean that was our plan but it's clear from dan that this is not something you can do in a short amount of time so right
in boundaries we don't really care about like an immediate word boundaries so no that's how i've
and if you align the two hypothesis files across the channels you know just were alignment you be able to find
can but it's possible that a script could be renter merge those two types of things i've
to get down me it depends on how locking there's so
that's my hope is that and that's what that's we should at least try it even if
and the balance is going to want to pull it this way right
whereas if somebody with a smaller had has it back here
of under here should work i think probably what
they probably just wasn't tight enough to the back of his head into
did they ever try going acoustic malls were a lot more complex
anyway i it's i'm just so bad at that
anything about so it just would have been you know getting up to be argumentative but
i mean the missing things so what

it was really efficient
and designed up here so but and
but i still think that there's no way we start before eleven and my end up really being twelve
but the only reason firming up the next thursday's meeting
to use buses for this experiment i think we can use or pretty much anything
we talked about that as being the whatever we have
we talked about that as being the next one's we wanted to transcribe whatever we have right
what would be we probably don't have to do necessarily a whole meeting for that if we just want to send them a sample to try
what would be a good number of minutes try
i mean is it pretty easy i think it's going to be one
right so the first thing is the automatic thing right
so the way imagine if they can't play it and they see
nothing it's cost so
cost so i'm still tinkering with it but
unless tinkering with it but it my grubby that we can't get penalized and so this so
and you know it pointed out some differences so i thought if we
you know the little hand held in trying to get lower low power and
it's that one is really very accurate i meant i mention the link
i find it very comfortable too
this is supposed to be under that little up right below do you feel the bacteria

that next weekend next week weekend week from next night
on friday and then i'm going down to san san jose friday night so
no i mean flying friday night so you know we start and late saturday that's a good thing
you know maybe we could figure out how long it'll take to do i know it seems
how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries
excuse me two or more times realtime right because
you have to say aha more slowly to get no
or the looking
it takes i don't know three four minutes to
i'm not what the cook what click on the ribbon you can or not
very he goes on to the bullet points about talking about the you know the little hand held in trying to get lower power and so on and microsoft pops low power and
whereas it sheltie and your speech pretty summer so i can't see really just putting in the same no i are too close
they tell t. paper it's really more of a introduction to the project paper and your
and yet like multiple video cameras covering every everybody every place in the room and video
we get a fortress so
i like the idea and have of is maybe generating minutes based on some of these things that we have because it would

had suggested it before i just don't know whether he did it
they're times when i want to hear the mixed signal bought but
thing i find it really convenient the weight set up right now
and then there was another bunch there were a couple person or something but if you actually have to grab it and
o. p. paper and we wanted to use that kind of analysis that utility
and then the problem with the boundaries that have to be shipped around so
so simple
and they right yes there and which is interesting and raise them and cameras
that's true it sounded like they were pretty thought out and they're going to be
but for this proposal in meeting summaries nation
there this is the last day a lot of different ones
but i mean there's that's a huge field and probably the groups there may not be representative of the feel that i don't know exactly
you sense ordering one was that personally in sky anyway one i'm just so bad
it was an interesting question
i mean it that's dissing it improperly i mean it was and
i mean it was and i study

and they have multiple
i that was sort of a side issue i didn't think so either that was the issue is that you have
whereas if you delete it so all they so that all they would
but the speech from the actual other channels i see
i find it very comfortable too but it was like interest was having problems i think morgan
having problems i think morgan was saying it
and i see that but i had haven't i had on this morning and it was fun
easy words one day it's
so i'm not saying anything about biased towards small head science but ways about hits
like that there legal issues don't allow them to do otherwise
what was there rough what was their conclusion or no read mostly germ it works
rough what was their conclusion read mostly germ
our interests and we should go around the room and one of the two c. lunch meetings and say you know what was good about the conference so do a trip report
it's sort of a far cry because they
anyway i it's in the program i'm just so bad at that

in which case it was news channels anyway that's what i'm concerned about that part right that's what i'm not about
in which case it was news channels anyway i am too that's what i'm concerned about that part right that's what i'm not about
in which case it was news channels anyway that's what i'm concerned about that part right that's what i'm not about
single channel and you do see all sorts of other besides just the voice
i think that they're going much more in acoustics in there and visuals
that's that i'm not what you did digital
she could tell which one was seven maybe
mirror either but there must be something wrong i mean
mirror and i we're having indicated out that i mean
you just send that to me no i didn't
which seemed reasonable given that you know the model for instance or the grammar wasn't
and or the grammar wasn't did
unless maybe we do this cancellation is right but that's i mean that was our plan but right

what is that it's actually it depends on if the
we have time to to prepare something that we in the form format we were planning for the idea in transcribers by then
this experiment and just we had talked about maybe
to originally so i actually before that they've goal directed this i didn't interface which showed each away form and you a ribbon for each way more
there and then there was the bump for the non natives and then the logical and so
overlap it's just whether or not the segments that were all synchronized whether there was some overlap somewhere and hike relation
we would really need ideally transcriber to time mark it you know the big at least the beginnings and of contiguous speech
right and you can also see in away from that it might be easier to delete something that's wrong then to insert something that's missing what do you think
right and you can also see in away from that's wrong then to insert something that's missing what do you think
if you can feel confident that what that but there's actually something that chain because then
between channels and that they found that's just not a big deal

that's when they're kind of that's correct within ten days
available and i don't know too much about this area where
you know their time and lines with these are two different
to separate mark right it would but we don't know exactly where the words are because the transcriber gave us two words and this time in and we don't really know kilos but
that's emerging prom if you had a if i mean it's
like they can be stressed i wouldn't make in most of the bands
some you know dummy reject not so blank for silence ass for speech
i wouldn't i notice when you turned your head it would tilt maybe
clumpy having it was no
that was an interesting discussion

like they can be stressed i wouldn't make in most of the bands
i corrected a fair number the words i'm about so
maybe the this maybe it wasn't just tightened enough or
people those who talk a lot have to wear heavier weights or something and ugh
and so what they're actually doing is they're really there's really two recording systems so that may not that's a great idea
that's true out and they're going to be real meetings it's
did they give a talk real meetings it's just that there which with people who would not be meeting otherwise
did they give a talk on this or was this informal no just informal
that it not only works in some cases it was better which i thought
it was this is wednesday morning and who to get the order

i was going to say i had these conversations business folks also is there and
and so they have their plan for room and with mics in the middle of the table and close minded mike's they're
and so that's a great idea
so that may not be precisely synchronized but they're but there's two recording systems one
systems one was fifteen twenty four channels along with sixty four channels the sixty
to worry about that was
fake they have scenario based
and they have i mean they have better adaptation and we had and that's some something
i mean i don't know anything about that field but for this proposal
the day that issue comes up all the time it was the only one that had

he generated channel wise peace but segmented version meeting but it try it out
meeting but it was robust lesser of the need to use so i it depends on whether we are willing to use buses for this experiment i think
this experiment and just we had talked about maybe doing do you is a good choice though
what are they looking at visually
it they have a choice they visually
it they have a choice they could choose any signal to look at i've tried
i mean you sort of have a good estimate where these places are because the recognition support
was talking use those for adaptation because

the short amount of time saying right so we you know we had spent a long
have been through it myself that so we could compare
stands for but what it is it's dummy had to very specially designed and that's that's right
there and anyway they like they're saying they may give up a couple or something for the camera i had to go with that
i just trying to discuss did say that they have lost it's all for doing calibration first you and all set between channels and
more complicated tasks not in that paper
it works
was whether folks from b. n. presenting this particular conference but yet there

eyes what kind of friends i had one question about aren't they sold blur
down from there's like from somewhere
there's like from somewhere to somewhere
it didn't matter whether it was the lapel or whether it was
that one of the meetings actually you we can tell from the data that they have from the session maybe
so i mean in your kitchen you were joking about it but i mean your case the fact that is talking about some of the things that a couple conferences it's not did
this is supposed to be under that little for two rent up right below do you feel the bacteria you feel little lump

beats but that should be really easy to do
so do we have a meeting but that's been done with
right so if they were only halfway through and that's what you give i b. m.
so i thought if we can do something quick and dirty because dan said the cross cancellation it's not straightforward if it were straightforward
he also kind of justice minimum time duration constrain and then what you get is noises mostly but that might be serious
you have to get the mouse up there on that on the text line in it and otherwise
in it and otherwise you just use an to get down me

it's got like four speakers then i i mean it we're just doing the individual or seven or
i mean it we're just doing the individual channels right or seven or eight
i mean it we're just doing the individual channels right or seven or eight
they show up on the separate ribbons so you have a separate oakland separate ribbons not that right
not might look at it right the problem is that the e. interface doesn't really allow users which visuals
your speech we want some results and get
or some i mean i would see your c. h. piercing your speech papers these will be paper submissions these would be things that are i

go ahead right and the we're recording about channel all right
this point and that cuts down the time that's what it seems to me too and that if they need to just like any other cases they can listen to the individual if they need to
so they have the normal channel trans interface where they have each individual speaker has their own line
but you're listening to the mix signaling your tightening the boundaries correcting
so there are some things available and i
senate safety just to check these

this wasn't actually this wasn't it before your meeting this was tuesday afternoon one robert just wanted a little recording and
a little recording and the power had gone out earlier in the day
you can switch quickly between the audio but you just can't it right
the audio but you just can't get the visual display to show quickly you have to
started in that yes i've been struggling with the fourth alignments
so there's either the beginning mostly the beginning word where do you you know talk somewhere into the segment

maybe that's the solution mean we could do different interfaces right what's you pre but the phone
it just seems to me that if you want to quickly was that chain no was that chuck no was that morgan right now you have to go up to the menu
i that was sort of a side issue i didn't think so either that was the issue is that you have you first have to have a pretty good speech detection and individual channels
those won't put down to separate mark right it would kilos but
and your consistent with that's an interesting idea
are you talking about for a paper is for the corpus

cases but you know what that may not be true maybe just some of the
maybe just some of the segments they're just doing a lousy job on
and it looks and so i look at all of the other others this from you chalk on that one conversation i don't know which
next to you and we can hear everything like that
but and some of what you i mean you also appear quite a bit in the cross talk
you if he sees nazi's were perfect in to begin with the detector that would already be an improvement but that's impossible

just something really wrong with and the science
i thought he just saying it to look over a longer time window need that but there are some issues
just look are you talking about the fact that the recording software doesn't do time synchronized is that where you're
or some you know dummy reject not x. there so blank for silence ass for speech
before i miss wednesday thursday might have been the one of the ones that we
actually if maybe the this thing that you have to it wasn't just tightened enough or

it never crashes on me i think
that i think what happens is it tries to clear the temp files and if they're too big crashes
after that time so then there would be no temp files
right it doesn't count i know it doesn't clear this necessarily so
it's it there called temp files

i wouldn't mind hearing how the conference and i'm just we have anything to talk about should we just recently kids to go
is right next weekend not the day's coming up but a week like
up but a week from saturday like
no but that would be a good idea so are we have like an agenda or anything that we should be
no but that would be a good idea anything that we should be so

that available and has it been corrected
bunch there were a couple person or something the normal but if you actually have to grab it and it was a you know dread was there i was the most of them but then they were
fair number the words i'm that they're accurate now you just tougher language model probably except
they're accurate now you just tougher language model probably except
kid it just was one of so they were command and control and that sort of thing

that's right so we need to run kilos thing on it and then we go in and just were talking about as
what you did digital what the digital test you had your interface i
i'm not last i tried but it
but it maybe change it again we should get them to do that because i
maybe change it again we should get them to do that because i

so you might as have run out of maxing over the entire meeting and
so it will miss like that which
likely is but it takes long enough that it's just not practical alternative that
and so it just was not dual with the current interface
you know i'm thinking if we have a meeting with only four speakers and

so you have a separate one for each channel and separate ribbons right
i do think that this will be a dual procedure and have a starting
so right now then maybe just buttons down
or i extracted it incorrectly it was labelled but
things so what they were saying so i think is you know boy and he's more data sort of but

the only problem is you know counting how many and if they're really correct or not
i don't know that you can locate them very from the mixing though
but you would know that they were there and then you would switch right and you would switching to the other right but once you know that they happen you can at least listen to the close talking so
so i'm going to try but
just have to see so actually i when i get together with both address and stefan with their respective assistants

were i think fifty five segments and annex waves and synthetic crude check and
time window need right so that but there are some issues of this timing in the recordings and
that's possible i know that there's complications any overlap sections in with lapel mike's but this
one of the problem that is often the simpler task isn't fully doesn't have all the phones and
and then it makes it very hard

area where if people aren't moving around much then you could apply them and it should
could apply them and it should work pretty if you took care of this recording time difference right which should be pretty
it's a good question actually because for the corpus
minded mike's they're talking about close minded and what else just because of and to race and
there this is the last day but i mean there's a lot of different ones

because it's just way too early but to be able to report you know actual numbers like if we had
but it's like you know it's wonderful to have like
the revolution so it's just a matter of you know from now on will be able to have things generalize to begin with right it will just have to see
right it will just have to see how hard that
would be an advantage does seem

i know one would be a good excuse work and i just
excuse work and i just can't to be giving talks and use the example from last week was everybody's doing the dishes it once
the abreast because you also see the press on the way through i've looked at the
way through i've looked at the it if i tried to do that with a single channel and

and my end up really being twelve so when
yes so they're using barriers to do these markings and as did dave do that change
yes click so they're using barriers to do these markings and as did dave do that change where you can actually just click rather than having to go up to the menu to listen to the individual channels i
notice said i like the microsoft talk gone scaling issues and word since disintegration that was interesting

so when we get closer will find people's plane schedules and everybody now
it wasn't it was by mobil but if you take
i think that when brian comes this will be an interesting aspect ask him as but
i meant i mention the link you

so of two kilos in here but
and do a whole meeting because we'll have to transcribe the whole meeting anyway sometime
i disagree the reason i because i think i would be much faster than going to the menu
the reason i disagree and that is that i you it's very good to have a just so station between the visual in the audience they're times when the menu

great get make that available matter
something really bad happened i just haven't listened to
but then they were the others solicited the king from there and then
i did go through one of these meetings i had one

that's good so you to it i don't see how that war though
all you have to do is just if it's really annoys
of the speech as a part of the non speech
i wonder if it's if would be an advantage does seem

that's it and let them into but then they for this meeting they would have to do seven times real time and it would probably be more than that
and if but you but it's very right because they have to at least listen to it each channel all the way through
and if but you but it's very quick right all the way through
i mean you scan i mean if you have a display of the way form

so that it can then scroll it you can cancel that
true click below and then go back to the menu select the next one then click below so you could
true to be faster but you know i mean the so you could definitely streamline that with you know this
right exactly but you don't want to in for from the alignment that someone spoke who did at the time

because really the you know then with the time marks you can do an automatic comparison if you're forced alignment
because really the at least in terms of how we were going to use this in our system wise to get an ideal an idea for each channel about the starting in boundaries we if you're forced alignment
because really the if you're forced alignment
because really the if you're forced alignment

there's just promise that bitch right i mean that would be maybe that will get enough of the cases to be useful
excellent i think morgan stuck went very it will
because i'm just thinking you know we're we've been talking about changing the mikes for a while and if these
his hair instead of under here we should work on compressing the hats i think probably what

let's just say that we're moving to this new era of like using pre segment to keep you know non thinking conversations doesn't
make sense to try to take what we have now which are the ones that you know we have recognition on which are synchronized and not time tightened and try to get something out of those four sort of purposes of those strains structure and the nature of the meetings or is it better to just you know forget that and it's i think we'll have
right then it falls back this way so it's so we have to
right then it falls back this way so it's so we have to what it's supposed

right bodies hope and maybe it but if we can't
and maybe weekend for the non motel but is it but if we can't then maybe we just have to
and maybe weekend for the non motel but is it but if we can't then maybe we just have to
worth if we can't then we can fake it even if we're we report you know we're wrong twenty percent time or ten percent of the time i think

and so as i say the problem with a real german so darren that's the problem in tennessee speakers
they're accurate now you just tougher language model probably except
but that might be useful just for each and dresses leaving
just for each and dresses leaving the building

this informal we just had some discussions various discussions just informal i also
i also sat and chatted with several in smokes they seem
in smokes they seem like a good group
she just have you read it i they it book that these little proceedings but

to take i think what's interesting is there's all these different evaluations you know how do you evaluate whether the summaries good or not and that's what's i'm very that and taking i was right down the wrong things
there's all these different evaluations i was right down the wrong things
or not and that's what's was sort of interesting to me is that there's different ways to the judge
was s. r. a. one of the group talking about summers there's no

but that's usually the mean that i recorded it never it doesn't crash
and everybody give the reports about what they're doing exactly the same time just all
anyway quick question not a high level to people think

that was fun love to play somebody that
he wanted to keep people from listening and you could like have that playing outside the room nobody could listen
i had this idea we could make her whole meeting after though

and what they're doing exactly the same time just all
want it on i just want to say what i think is a problem with this if you put it on
if you are wearing this over here's you've got all the way out here

so i would be me taking a very early flight induced
you know a matter of we had the revolution enough so i'm not i don't know it's just
but it's like you know it's wonderful to have the revolution so it's like

and i think it's an empirical question can't we it couldn't
they can but i i didn't know anything about transcriber i was going to make something to let them adjust boundaries i would just show them one channel at a time with the marks and let them into but then they have to do but then they for this meeting they would have
they can with the marks and let but then they have to do but then they

i know for a fact that one of those she could really she could judge what the number was based on the way form that's actually true you're right you're right mean i found
could judge what the number was that's actually true
not look they wouldn't look at it

i don't i'm not entirely confused about what they do so but
the solution we could do different interfaces right what's you pre but the phone
that's what i try to originally so i doesn't

signal yes but the procedure that you're imagining i mean people vary from this is that they have to make signals away form in front of them
can't play it and they see how this happened then and if it's about right they just sort of let it slide and if right
out because the only thing transcribed in this channel is this war

it does something or shape re computations so that it can then scroll it quickly but then you can cancel that
yes i was curious about that because he was what i was seeing i look those things it i was going to call quadra modal because there is a whole lot of cases where was your a person
i didn't think that his time but

you would know that they were there and then you would switch once you know that they happen you can at least listen
but you know i mean the in the ideal world
alyssa it modal modal actually trying to though so

mixed signal bought but i want to transcribe on the single channel so right then maybe
under that little for two rent do you feel the bacteria you feel little lump
i you can control it that tilts right

maybe i just don't i don't see that it's next to it just something so that it's not in the menu option
don't i don't see that it's to it just something so that it's not in the menu option so that you can do it much faster
i mean that's the way i think that might be a personal style thing i find it really

and each time go up to the menu select it listen to that channel then click below and then
but then he right just on the lapel and got about five or six percent were there
so that means to me that somewhere in the other work or things there are some pathological cases but

two zero a little bit than a lot there were there was one
zero percent two zero a little bit than a lot there were there was one how one bump that year around zero which were the native speakers but not pathological
zero percent there but not pathological venice seekers there was another

this is the area there was another bump that like fifteen or something
presenting yet there was let's see this was on the last day mitre b. n. and mitre d. and i b. m.
this was on the last day mitre b. n. and mitre d. and i b. m.

amount of time saying right so we you know we had spent a long time writing up the h. o. p. paper and we wanted
good point i was just thinking about the fact that it she lives miss the short segments that might be quite time consuming for them to insert them
i forget what team are as stands for but what it

that seems to be you can do that over the entire filing get a very accurate i don't think
i get a very accurate i don't think that was the issue
or some i mean it's probably wouldn't make sense i them

we have but then you have the problem of not knowing where the words are because these meetings were done before that temptation but maybe there's something
like they can be stressed i wouldn't make in most of the bands
i i don't want it on i just day it's all so you can put it on

what is why do you need but maybe there's something that could be done
what is why do you need the this worked on it for the h. l. t. i mean for the your speech paper that could be done
i i wanted to just do something not on recognition experiments because it's just way

of that and how hard it would be to in principle to write something that would do that
i had one transcribers go through and kind of depends on one of the and the same meetings and i went through
meetings and i went through afterwards and double checked it's that one is really

actually that's a good question because we'd because for the corpus it would be if everything were
actually that's a good question because we'd it would be if everything were
question because we'd have to completely redo those meetings and we have like ten of them now were we would have

probably going to spend another day or so trying to improve things by by using because to get attention
the right now i'm using the idea that models so the first alignments and
and it's possible that you get considerably better results if you managed to adapt the phone models to the speaker and the reject model to all the other speech

there's some discussion of fifty nine to fifty nine elements
there's some discussion of fifty nine to fifty nine elements
might go down to fifty seven

right and the crash
like pre crash that

then what we'll go back later and review the individual channels right actually and then everyone can listen to it later so
then what we'll go back later and review the individual and then everyone can listen to it later

channels right you want to know actually that we haven't doing so
and then it's coupled with the problem that sometimes you know with if it could give you might get the beginning of the word cutoff and

question about aren't the u. w. folks coming this weekend blur no the
is just thank god all right

we start gathering those ideas but the only reason
that generalization because sometimes people say and then i and then long pause and

so have you heard back from brian about that
it i forget his anybody working any your speech submission related to this

i think i mentioned last meeting he said that
you talk to them and it was fine with the beach they would be

i have the program to insert the beats what i
to insert the beats what i don't have is something to percy out but of the channel lies transcripts to find out where to put the beats but that should be really

great to maybe it doesn't matter
and so we just look for you know somebody sitting next to adam that one of the meetings actually you we can tell

that's right so we need to run and check because that was one of the versus these were talking about as
do you remember who the group's were that we're doing there this is the a lot of different ones

i the only thing i'm not about is how quickly
might be because we saved those out already to be able to do that but it won't work

times realtime right because they have to at least listen to it
can reply finance so that say there's the transcriber gets on with a quarter of the meeting and then you run into this other

and then it's the transcribers taking up and then it's
yes i was curious about that because he was what

i mean i don't know that was the question though
that i agree whatever they had gotten up to

that i agree so if we were then it seems like giving them something whatever they had gotten up to you know nothing i don't think i mean
i think that they should be able to get through a whole meeting in one sitting

digital channels
so it's going to be depending on the number of people in the meeting

rhyme or it will miss them it right so you'll have to lie
will miss them it you'll have to lie

the problem is i just don't think
there's something though about keeping and it's probably another discussion keeping the that he lives detector detected as possible speech and just marking it as not speech than deleting it then when you i see so

see there's and we don't have transcription yet
yes so but there's markers of some sort that it didn't happen automatically know show right

it you could have yes and this airline moving across the way for him just goes yes
if you have to and they're at d. i just like here in their speech

very quickly you can't but it takes time that's it the problem is that tickle t. k. interface with the visuals it's very slow to load way for us
so i that's sort of a last

visually you can you and so when i tried that was the first thing i tried when i first started it right
that's actually a better way to do it because feel the else

to it takes long enough it's very so
to be argumentative but i mean the missing

i you could set up multiple windows each one with a different signal showing and then looked between the windows maybe that's mean
maybe that's the solution mean we could do different what's you pre

on the ribbon you can get that get
so it's think i haven't checked our senate safety just

known like i agree that be
no that's it i forget his anybody

we have time you do next friday so we
next friday so we have to do the experiments and write the paper

actually still phones results i think confirmed that he said he did
this for probably five is should pick out a paper too you know got our interests and we should

so i listen to it and find out since you'd actually split it up by segment
locking there's so many extra things that would make it one of them harder than the other or vice versa sign a simple

did you run so i can actually listen to it
versa sign a simple question but you know mean principle

a bug is what i mean so that it's like recording and
maybe that's an interface issue that might be stressful i think it's

mean so that it's like and there was this one meeting
which probably means like there was this one meeting i forget which one is wise where like six other c. a. channels were all like one hundred percent there

no but there's a little difference but there's no overlap during to degenerating it shouldn't really matter there's a lot that way but it would be right so it shouldn't
no but there's a little difference and we had look at for it shouldn't really matter there's a lot so it shouldn't

forced alignment have you started in that yes i've been struggling
ass for speech x. for

so this scheme that i through on the board last time where we tried to a lot reject models with speech from other speakers
most of the time it doesn't work very so

i didn't think that his message that it wasn't straightforward we just
a really good question and i really find a pain in the neck to delete things because you have to get the mouse

which it right which should be pretty straightforward
which it at least is twelve defined and straightforward

and but then if you add the dynamic aspect of adapting distances then it wasn't
i it just wasn't something that he could do quickly not in time for us to be able to do something my two weeks now so

so no that's how i've been looking at it i mean i
been looking at it i mean i don't care that individual words incorrectly but you

so that's why i was wondering if it i mean so
it i mean maybe if it doesn't work for the towel we can just not use that i haven't i

and or preferably also there's someone sitting next to them who talks a lot
and so meeting with me in so i maybe someone

from the data that they have there's from the session maybe
a way to tell it might not be a single person who's always overlapping that person but any number of people and

it was to get more data and but without knowing where the real words are in time
frankly because you have two maneuver around on the on both windows and

with these are two different channels and somebody's talking here and somebody else's talking here just that word
if kilos can tell us that their boundaries here we should be able to figure that out because the only thing transcribed

and i discuss it with you know i mean if you have any ideas
be i mean i in principle i could imagine writing a script which would approximation to some degree but

i mean that would be really helpful that was
really helpful that was sort of another possibility yes because it seemed like most of the cases

sort of another possibility yes because it seemed like most of the cases are in fact the single word sorts or at least a single
or at least a single phrase

pause and finish the sun's and
finish the sun's and sometimes it looks coherent and the i mean

much to ask and so it intimate and you know means
i think that they're always that they would have to be cement we can but it's possible that

in terms of not him doing it but we
him doing it but we discuss some of the premieres of that and how hard it

one's easier i the semantics aren't clear when you a segment right because
you could just say it's a noise you would say you would have to determine what the surroundings were

just just say it's just put x. you know like not speech or something and really annoys
i think it's easier to add and delete and then you can get

something so let's say someone is talking to here and then you have a little segment here
is that part of the speech as a part

like it because feel the force one it would probably be more consistent
like i think there's a complication which is that you can have speech annoys i mean if it's just as easy but

i think there's a complication which is i mean if it's just as easy but
you know on the same channel the same speaker so nelson

so nelson as you might microphone pop and
pop and i mean they're these fuzzy hybrid cases and then the

and also i mean i still haven't i still have you know the first one i think that when brian no you're right @reject@
and also i mean i still haven't i still no you're right @reject@

when brian kinks very comes brian used my faces
comes used my faces ryan and it's was right

good question trying to come no that's a good point though because
good question trying to come no that's a good point though because

need to get a decent
that's my hope is that and that's what ever since we should at least try it even if

i agree there we were never going to just go with these as the final alignments we're always right and so you're
there we were never going to just go right and so you're

would you at the same time adapt to reject model to the speech from all the other channels they just said that sort of thing that's
not just the speech from that of the other people from that channel

if you for adaptation because if you use everything then you get all the cross talk in adaptation is just sort of blurred and that we know that's a good point
if you blurred and that we know i mean we have that and it's about

know that was a veteran meter saying that it was fully trash it's full
says that he about energy or very he goes

these would be things that are particular things aspects
aspects of it that we're looking at rather than you know attempted to global paper about it detail overall

week before i miss wednesday thursday that might have been the one of the ones that we did
it's right against your head there which is what it's supposed to be that balances it

myself that might actually be useful they're all non so we could compare this and after and see
michael collected enough that you

and extremely so as i say the problem with a real german so darren that's the problem in tennessee speakers
i don't think we have much longer pre go

i know to justin michael collected enough
but it's a good paper

think it's come this is the first time i've worn this i find it very comfortable i
but there's still planning to do like fake scenario

i you can control it that tilts right
so i'm and lots of different ways

it seems to be the of five pound weight off the back that's good right of his head into the directions do talk about spending it tears size which is not really what we want
seems to be the of five pound weight off the back about spending it tears size which is not

hang if i've laid off of a hang five pound weight off the back right we did that we
hang if i've laid off of a weight off the back right we

or maybe this could be helpful just for evening the conversation between people as a counter balance
what was there kid it just was one of them and or no

but it was about going to a new task we have insufficient data and using data from something else in adapting and how that works
so and in fact it was pretty related to it was interested accept that this was not eating it was right

like i think fish than the surfer broadcast news system then they went to that they're broadcast news was
news system then they went to that they're broadcast news was their acoustic malls and then all the other tasks

but i've done the same thing i've been using broadcast news
like for this brought speech proxy thing that i did that's what

in the program i should've read it to my myself but
myself but that sort of useful and i think

and it has to be though someone from this group because of the technical nature of this thing
thing who actually does take notes

but i didn't have as much disagreement as i would have liked that i didn't want to i wouldn't so
liked that i didn't want to i wouldn't did want to get into it because you know it was the applications when i didn't know anything about

like pre crash that

what is that it depends on if the temp files are there or not at least

when the power went out the other day and i restart it crashed the first time that's right

it's it there called temp files but they're not actually in the

but they're not actually in the temp directory there and scratch so

they're not backed up they're not erased either on terror

that was fun love to play somebody that

we so the dealers that i can i can be available after like ten thirty or something i don't know i don't

but i'm going to be here till eleven or so that's

if i got that day but this is on sunday

if i got that day but this is on sunday or saturday

speech is due on friday and then i'm

no i mean flying up from thing seattle

early flight induced timer difference running the right way but i still

so that's good but maybe an agenda

so that's good but maybe an agenda early somethings talk about would be a good idea

he's i'm should've forwarded that along

meeting he said that you talk to them and

great but for the purpose of sending him a sample one to maybe it doesn't matter

that's right and then we go in and just the boundaries

and we haven't done that i could and time how

i could set someone on that tomorrow and time how long it takes

i could set someone on that tomorrow and time how long it takes

i know it seems to we probably should go ahead and do a whole meeting because

yes except that if they had if there's a choice between having fifteen minutes of toys away one and having a whole meaning that didn't get at what you wanted for them just

kind of how much i mean i we have to do it again anyway

kind of how much i mean i we have to do it again anyway but

pretty easy i think it's going to be one or two times realtime at

so that's i'm just thinking that from a gate keeping track of the data point of view and maybe pass to send them a little meetings at the time and not try to send them bits and pieces

and have them fix it or the entire meeting too right

but starts in beginning or the end right so if they were

i mean the i the question my mind is do we for the transcribers to adjust the marks for the whole meeting before we give anything to i b. m. or

anything to i b. m. or do we go ahead and send them a sample at

lester least what if they were my sequentially it why wouldn't we give them i mean it

i them i mean it i we're trying to get something done by the time brian comes

i mean i don't know that was the question

think i mean they typically work for what four or something like that

i would think unless it's a lot harder than we think it is which it could be

i there is this issue of you know if the segment or thought there was no speech on a particular stretch on a particular channel and they're really was

channel and they're really was it than if it didn't show up in a mixed signals to verify and it might be overlooked

so mean question is should ever listen to the entire thing or can it can't be based on the mic signal and i'd as

and that cuts down the time if they need to just like any other cases

what like you're talking about

what like you're talking about tightening up time boundaries

should be pretty good except for the boundaries you shouldn't have to tighten too much because dealers program does that

except for doesn't do on short things rhyme or it that right so

will miss them it wellness most of the really short thing you'll have to lie

to get no i'm actually serious so it will miss worked on that

but like that which so that's something that the transcribers will have to do

but presumably most of those they should be able to hear from the mixing all unless they're better than the havel heavy overlap section in which case that's right have to do

an empirical question can't we it couldn't we just have

and maybe that's just doesn't fit with the software but i

the problem is the abreast because you also i just don't think

form she could tell which right mean i found the same thing that when i was scanning the way form i could see when someone surgery digits just by the shapes

so they're looking act a mixed signals or the looking

look at i've tried looking but usually the look at the next

but i've tried looking at the single and in order to judge when it was station when it wasn't but

when it wasn't but the problem is then you have breasts which would show up on the signal but

happen automatically know show up on the next signal there's

they show up on the separate ribbons signal there's oakland not that

so you have a separate one for each channel separate ribbons right

and it'll be because it's being segmented at challenge time with his with you is new procedure then

new procedure then you don't have a correspondence of the times across the bins that crosses ribbons it you could have and this airline

and if it there's a question on something they stop and maybe look at individual way for right

not look they wouldn't look at it at this point they

at this point they would just listen

they might look at it right the

takes on it good s. the i don't

quickly but then you can't change the resolution nurse cruel quickly really

mean so we could use like x. waves instead of transcriber

and it loads faster certainly what if you were to pre load

what if you were to pre load all the channels or initially like

the problem with it is even with just three wave forms it was just painfully slow to scroll so you just

so you just roll screen and would you know go her chunk and so

and a sort of a hack but i mean it would be one way of seeing the visual form i think that if we decide

the visual form i think that if we decide that we need that they need to see the visuals we need to change the interface so that they can do that

so that's actually why i thought of loading the chopped up way farms i mean you know that would make it faster but isn't

the problem is if anything's cut off you can't expand from the chopped up right his neck

at some point wouldn't that be the same as the mixed signal

i mean the individual channels that were chopped up that it'd

were chopped up that it'd be hilly go back and forth between those short segments because you don't really

segments because you don't really need like nine tenths of the time you're throwing most of them out but what you

out but what you need are those that particular channel at that particular location

but it won't work for i. b. m. course it only works

m. course it only works here because they're not sitting out individual

with next and then when they get over overlaps just have them smack the check all the channels to be that there's a something hidden from audio view

mixed signal be over last are pretty audible because it is all you make life so i think they

life so i think they should be able to hear the only

but right now to right and you would switching to the other to the close talking so

but right now to do this limitation to switching is going to be switching of the audio saying right

you can get thee you can get a switch audio

so right now maybe i just don't i don't see then maybe just buttons down at the bottom next to it just something so that it's

to be faster but you know i mean the that with you know this

i would like to try to do something on digits but i just don't know if

but i just don't know if we have time you do

it was a it's we other one conversation about what did it mean for one of those speakers to be pathological was it right

and i haven't had set a chance to sit down listen i was going to do that this afternoon i haven't listened to him

a chance to sit down listen i was going to do that this afternoon i haven't listened to him either but there

i was going to do that this afternoon i haven't listened to him either but there

course i think it's probably something pathological actually still phones

he said he did the were system

also got very lousy average error like fifteen or fifteen to twenty percent average but

on the is i thought it's sent that around to everyone you just send that to no

you just send that to me no i didn't since

alyssa so if you it's actually and it was try modal actually

zero percent there but not pathological venice seekers

this is the area talking about

those are the non native and

and then there was another distinct on but like a hundred which must have been some problem i can't

with a bug is what i and the recording

which probably means like there was that the recording interface crashed or hundred percent there

crashed or there was a short you know someone was tickling look forward or but

it was transcribed incorrectly something

but having split up that way but

and we had look at for digits right and so

some summer non natives are pretty non hate so

work very so and that i haven't done i mean the only way to texas right now is for me to actually low decent ex waves and you know plus the alignments and play them see where the

i don't know which you probably know which one i mean it's with you were on the love pal and morgan was sitting next to you and

so went to one of those there

high but it's very reduced i that's just

is but that's i mean that was our plan but right

is but that's i mean that was our plan but right

that utility paper has you know it's very crude measure of overlap it's not really something

it's not really something you could scientifically say is overlap it's just whether

the segments that hike relation

if it were straightforward know it try it but

so sort of good to hear that was not straight forward thinking if we can get decent force alignments then at least we can just sort of overall report of what happens with actual overlap in time but

you just have to look over longer time when you're trying to align the things you can't

to align the things you can't just look are

synchronized is that where you're referring to

and it's dynamic so i it was more dynamic than some simple models would be able to so

under dress how so i don't know what we can do if anything that's sort of worse you know you're a speech paper at this point

under dress how did it work on the towel

so it's think i haven't checked our

haven't i just haven't had the time to to the same procedure one of the i would

i would need a kid i would need a channel that has speaker who was whereas a lot of overlap but you know is not lapel mike and

so meeting with me in it maybe someone can help you find

so meeting with me in it maybe someone can help you find a good candidate and then i would be willing to

week you know what maybe the best way to find that would be to look through these

because you can see the seat numbers

and then you can see what type of mike they were using and

there's a way to tell it

there's a way to tell it

could do one is just do like nama pals of putting it good enough alignments

another one was to try to get

somehow align kilos energy second patience with what we have but

like if we had hand transcribed perk good alignments or hand checked alignments then we could do this paper it's not that

do this paper it's not that needed to be automatic

it was to get more data and better fit to squeeze the boundaries that in time to know what an overlap

fit to squeeze the boundaries that to know what an overlap really it's really an overlap or if it's just and a segment correlate with an overlapping because it's a difference

because it's a difference to me between like a real paper and promise very paper

it might be possible to take peels output

and like if you have the great no these meetings are all throughout the digital camera

throughout the digital camera again every

but you know if there are things two words

in their speech here then it doesn't really help you so

prom if you had a if you has if you had a script which would i've thought it's

and i discuss it i mean if you have any ideas

degree but there's just promise that bitch maybe

stressed i wouldn't make that generalization because of the bands

and the i mean it's not a simple problem

but it's really and then it's coupled

word cutoff and so it's coupled with the problem that he was isn't perfect either i

perfect either i mean we've it's like you have emerging problem plus emerging plus this problem of not you right

but that's impossible you know it does too much to ask and

types of things i've discussed it with you

and i in the future it won't be as much of an issue it's transcribers are using the titan boundaries to start with then we have

it's just to start with then we have a good idea of where the foursome lyman is constrained too

it's just you know a matter of we had the revolution enough improved interface one months too late but it's like too so i'm not i don't know it's just like

that's right so whether the corrections take too much time i was just thinking about the fact

that you're not going to miss something because then you just delete

that you're not going to miss something i think it's because then you just delete it and you don't

the problem that you're not going to miss something i think it's because then you just delete it and you don't have to pick a time

the problem i you know i it's a really good question and i

you know mean principle like you know if one of them is easier than tobias it or whichever one's easier i

could just say it's a noise so and right you know post processor will just

all you have to do is just if it's really annoys

i think it's easier to add and delete frankly because then you can get

adder too easily

i think it's the semantics that are questionable to me that you believe

me that you believe something so

mean what you embedded in

then when you align it then they lie they can you can put a reject model or whatever and your i see so then they could just like put out that's what you meant by just put an x. there that's

then when you align it then they lie they can i see so then they could just like put out that's what you meant by just

then they lie they can you can put a reject model or whatever out that's what you meant by just put an x. there

and your consistent with the automatic system whereas if you delete that's an interesting idea so all

whereas if you delete it or so all they so that all they would have to do is put like an x. there

and it's i think we'll have to eventually

right and my hope is that we would be able to use the forced alignment to get it but if we

we would have to redo them we would just

to redo them we would just have to edit them

good question trying no that's

to come a good point though because for feature extraction like for profit or something i mean the meetings we have now is a good

is a good chunk of data we

is that and that's what ever since that's ever meeting that i transcribed from last year for someone has been on the table as a way of cleaning up later and it even if on the table right

and so i'm hopeful that's possible i know

we might be able at the very worst we can get transcribers to correct the cases where i mean you sort

i agree we're always going to run and pass somebody so we need some way to push

going to run and pass somebody so we need some way to push these first chong can meetings into a state where we get good alignment

other channels i see

because you a lot of it dominance by channel properties exactly

but what you do want to do is take even if it's kludgy take the segments that synchronized segments segment someone from the chill t. paper where only that speaker was talking use those they want to

but what you do want to do is take they want to

that and it's about roughly two search i mean very roughly averaged

it's not completely negligible

like a third of it is bad for adaptation

it really it depends a lot thought it was higher than that

it really it depends a lot that's just sort of an overall higher than that

that's just sort of an overall

i know we're not turning into your they

they redo a utility paper

i'm doing that for years

bleep but i think we're all morgan stock went very i think believe really

you know it was really a then ending up in alaska especially the battery meter some good jokes in that

then ending up in alaska especially the battery meter popping up that

know that was a veteran was hilarious right when you were talking about that

and microsoft pops up a little window saying your batteries are now fully charged

i'm thinking about script thing that for my talk you know put but a little script and they're to say your batteries are low right when i'm saying that

did you conferences have to really a different emphasis whereas it

or some i mean probably wouldn't make sense i

of it that we're looking at rather than you know detail overall

i'm trying to read i remember number those are all

to read i remember number offhand funny and i said those are all

i send email before the conference before last week that might

myself that might actually be useful they're all non native speakers so as i say the problem so we could compare this and after and see that's the problem in tennessee

native speakers and so as i say the problem with a real german so darren that's the problem in tennessee speakers

and extremely hard to follow like word wise i got to with a real german so darren speakers

i corrected a wise i got to transfer i mean i have no idea what they're talking about so

i don't think we have much longer pre go

i it's for you to talk a little without the mike

actually if you have a larger head that mike's got to go farther way which means the balance is going to make it wanted to town thing that you have to

they seem really good but they're not comfortable

i good but they're not comfortable we have the same problems we have these stupid things

this way so it's what it's supposed to do is the back strep is supposed to be under your crown and so that

crown and so that should be

so this is supposed to be so it doesn't flight up

i wonder if it's if he was wearing over his hair instead of under here would be an advantage we should does seem i think

off of a back right we at boeing i used i was doing augmon realities they had announce on and we had a little

counter balance and we had a little jury rigged one with a welders how much

or maybe this could be helpful just for evening and we have just a bag with a bunch of more as a counter balance

and yet like multiple and video

you the mics in the middle to had not a my exceed lapel mike's your ray it was

because there was a some pressure from a couple people at the meeting for the music in our head

four channels the sixty four china one severe ray but

but they've got so many channels there and anyway

they have to do something like that based right there

that's true out and they're going to be real meetings it's

what was the the paper by where the that you mentioned

and then all the other tasks were much simpler

that was one of the ones that i liked that it not

it was better which i thought was pretty interesting that's because

was pretty interesting that's because they in control for parameters

did they ever try you know broadcast news nets were not nets acoustic malls were

did they ever try going be other direction from simpler task to more complicated tasks acoustic malls were a lot more complex not in that paper

i've been using broadcast news nets for digits like for this

the summers nation was interesting i mean i don't know

cry because they weren't working with meeting typed it up but

it up but get sort of an overview of the different approaches

was whether folks from b. n. that i don't know exactly that every once and it's this particular conference but

clumpy having it was no

it was no it was this is wednesday morning you sense and who to get the order one

and i think like when mari and countrymen jeff are here be good to figure out some kinds of things that we can start doing maybe just on the transcripts because we already have

that we have because it would be easy to do that just

i think what's interesting is take notes i'm very that and taking

the day that issue comes up all the time it was the only one it was the only one that had any sort of real disagreement about

i study they were doing this was the word since disintegration it was which it's sort of was

and they're there and that but it was a very simple case of two versus too and there
