which happens in a few places
correct talking string watching and talking about the entire page
and so that the two options are changed the transcript to match what they really sad but then
i don't think that really matters because the
little easier five how many are how my how often does that happen
physical should just change the transcript
and so i just want people to take a quick look at the instructions and the way
makes sense and if anyone has any comments on it
because if you start talking about these you
she's trying to get it natural groupings but it's
i've been a day off all week
i think is when one reviewer says you know the should be far more detailed and then like the
this is way too general than the other years is
who i would change them to maps instead being
to maps instead being m. r. one it would be m. r. zero or one i don't
a lot and for purposes of things like
in my case scene i watched the second that he's
not the first one i did for this worked
for this worked really we were hearing you breathing like is it for your inner ear you
your inner ear you know it's like
you i mean breath is natural but not
it is but it is if you recorded

maybe it's just you know how many how many times creche and day this morning
and then i want to talk a little bit about naming conventions although it's
conventions although it's unclear whether this is the right place to talk about it
earlier actually the same thing happened to me i sent one earlier the message
one earlier the message says you'll be informed and then i
be informed and then i was never informed but
permission technology research programs part of national science foundation
of efficiency maybe i was thinking maybe the best way to do this in the long run maybe to give them single channel parts and then piecing together
be much the morning can now
i'd always different people
only looking at the energy multiples of of that frequency and
and so just looking at the energy in those that the harmonic is that going to

but it's just too thing ways that you can say
that's the only thought i have because if you start
no that i got a little excited notes from mine justin so to mari good
one that's easy enough to do and i don't think
also it's irrelevant to the people on the project and
and then piecing together later and i have
wondering and i think again it's like this it's really valuable that he was working on the speech sounds speech segment asian because maybe
it there are still speaks so i can see peeks and it more fun around d. c. a. if it was the i'm monique
and maybe could use some other keep methods to shortcut it by making some guesses but
and the case where there's only one speaker so
type of attack you propose you think we between all dropping a speech
the t. v. a. might not have too but no but and any application may have to

i have no idea but i just got a few minutes ago right when you were in my so
because they said now and didn't
could always say something about transcription i've been
pretty busy day suffolk we starting to define the sound
five or six times happen
and then the other thing is that the forms in front of us here that we're going to read later were suggested by liz because she wanted
liz because she wanted to elicit some differences ought x. from digits
but so it's all that none of us are doing right now on a suspended
now on a suspended for so it's

and you know it's it would be wonderful if it's possible then to use a however much more type the time all the channels after that
once in a while a back channel will be overlooked by the transcriber as you might
we're lots which is what i want to do analysis of that
now firmly four speakers that's not going to be too much time but if it's
that's no i don't put the process data from them and energy
some guesses but
i mean you could make some guesses from from not a correlation or something but
to get the pitch i know many people use it'll plus because pretty to get to the beach

say what the transcribers did with that is if they did a correction and they eventually did read the right string you extract the right to strike are you talking about where they completely
digits and i'm speaking for her so she's not here but
and they said and of business day you could check on the review reforms is that tomorrow
but they have to weed out enough so that they have enough reviewers right
often and it's you know see what happens
i don't know what the right word is
but i don't they did duffy to get rid of it i mean that be

than the other years is way too specific
maybe they'll be something useful and it
so that means i instead of calling it m. r. one and mark too you'd call it m. r. m. zero one m. r. m. zero two
you want to keep him same like across different meetings also so like
because they have to i'm not openings
essential i mean because i think the main thing is that you're trying what are you doing
i mean he knows florida i'd

maybe when i did not crash this morning
you extract the right to strike i didn't notice are you talking about where they completely read the wrong thing and didn't correct it
i didn't notice which happens read the wrong thing and didn't correct it
and then like the next of your is way too much detail
and now i'm i'm trying to find a sign guy also if headed there you seemed energy tools to distinguish between those who are mornings i know that if it frequency peaks that says quarries nothing more like
i have tools put the wage would you was in group and all day something you frequency because

some things like training the station on c. segment patient thing it's
thing it's necessary to have it more tightly tuned in that and
it so no it's you know no is this seattle rhythm where you hypothesize fundamental and then get the energy for all the harmonic so that fundamental and
no it's you know get the energy for all the
they're going to be dampened by be vocal tracks right
respond to the vocal track and

the speakers who we had just this these interesting see
sometimes then maybe the answer is too listen especially densely in places of overlap just so that they're
six hours to me that was saddam's that kid the paper today battalion for when
that's no i then a pesticide the new fundamental get energy
enough so that it's essential

but it's probably along the line i could be wrong
having b. interface that doesn't require them to do the type that time means for every single channel through the entire interaction
they do and the t. experience
do speeding's if and the t. experience money send
speeding's if it so money send is

one of them is that it seems that there are time likes involved in doing this
i really do think that it's wise that we've had them start the way we have with
with working up the mixed signal
but that was just demonic on
since that you have to do some kind of low pass filter before you see that

i think the average is around four or five
and they have first phase where you put in pre proposals and
in pre proposals and we got through that and so that
that's i would too good for this week or ornament responsible to them see t.

which is also true for the proof also so
exactly what was in the fools will
guard large spaces where there's no overlap at all some is giving a presentation
of it i mean that be enough so that it's

do you know anything about the numbers no
just it's just from his messages sounded like that
there was a sentence you know one of his paragraph
i should go back and look i didn't

we're on and we seem to be working we one
to be working we crash we're not crashing anymore and it really one two three four
first time first send the day

anymore and it really bothers me no i do
you crushed when i did not crash crashing i crashed when i started this morning
you crushed when i did not crash when i started this morning

agenda that it was dress can't can't come so i do i have agenda
i'm a little and maybe that it's faster to transcribe the channel at a time with only one sound file and one either insist to check through
confused i thought that one of the reasons we thought we were so much faster than and the other transcription thing was that we were using the next yes but

right when you were in my office arrived
a script i can piecing together i mean so it's like
i mean so it's like i know that i can take apart put them together in on to put the representation which is where the

other than me i actually have one more also just talk about the digits
i thought it was smaller that
the last one was that you know there was about naming

the first is what should we do about digits that were mis read
my opinion is we just throw them out completely and
twenty me when they do you know how many defined is when they say in trucks

really matters because the conditions are so different
and that would be a little easier how many are
and i don't think we have so many meetings about the big deal just to change the names

it's a couple hours of speech currently
and the decision here west to continue with the words rathers and the new americans
do you know anything about that they didn't reject a lot of the evils

which is unreasonable visible test that
all some is giving a presentation whatever
it's composed as opposed to all these all the total energy

city eight ninety one is probably how they so i mean
so i mean this is something that listen i spoke about and since
except that we're trying to mimic

actually this is maybe a little side thing
back and look i didn't i don't think that's true
very because we didn't want to weed out much in the first place

up u. dub that's not on our side that's on the you'd side
size they have three size grants this one there's
see the small ones are less than five hundred thousand total over three years and that

was never informed but i got replies from people indicating that they had gotten
it's just to prevent spam
so my way i everybody here you are an atlas

and meeting mapping this and
so is it for it was proposal for the i. q. our program nine
and just look at at the signal coming out of that a lot of

when's wonderful postal do
i think april ninth or something postal do
this is why would it correspond to

of us left insurance how many words
there's different numbers of or worse for different size they have three
boy i forget i think more than

matter find out what i
i mean last time i think they just had two categories small and
and that there be expansion but also

it's just for the research to continue the research
it's extending to continue the research on mini recorder
it's extending the research right because

the other it's higher level that we've been talking about for me meeting recorder
the other things that we have been working on with the good communicator especially recorder
especially with the newer things but

we have some new microphone so i'd like to start trying out
them and then we'll need to specify that somewhere so i was just going
just overall he said all

i don't know exactly where that's going at this point
ninth grade schools and i jets there too and to improve it and i don't should teasing and that type of today i mean couldn't
but they separate because say i get to

sparse your face faces because they're a large basis of it that's a good point
higher frequencies will be lower energy
which would be ideal situation because

and that's what that's it and they way you look to it that they would posting day and day something frequencies right always
i suppose since
i i'm not following enough i'm probably going to happen

an envoy so if you don't care about that
so we're we're dealing with real speech or trying
with real speech or trying to have israel as possible and breasts

determination to but if it's voice
the fraction of energy this and how monica sequence that you're looking at is relatively low then it should be then it's more likely to be an overlap he's funny
did you say they he i sat

song from the that owned it pretty
enough i'm probably going to have to look at the paper but which i'm
was some i have the indication from down alice and you know that i sent you an you know about

they hey foodstuffs
hot to you
the i don't know what these day

it's a matter of experience
i have no idea but i just did they send the messages to you about anything so

that's great so learning
she with twenty space them out they don't look like forty three anymore

in and told me because no one sent me anything else did they send
and the way it was worked and see if it makes sense and

i mean one too much but the then you said one time but digits i have a
i have a short thing about the jets and then i want

so maybe just talk about it very briefly and take the details
and take the details to the people who for mozzarella

forms an extract out pieces that are in air so
four thousand i would for social

so two things the first is
deep cooler fifty tools

have them read again by someone else
new brothers so assuming everybody's completely busy now means we're going to have to hire more students or something

the other thing you could do is change the transcript and that's what they really sad so i'm not completely
but there's often so those are the two options

but there's often things that people do fall starts i know are the two options
fall starts i know i've done it where i say what the transcribers did with

really sad but then the transcript isn't to run test that anymore i don't think that
for so it's it would be new so assuming everybody's

is between on online
so i was just going to do it fixed list of microphones and types

the problem was one zero
that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling speaker database so that we get those links back and forth and

the other problems we were thinking about is if you just put the new rules they might say forty three instead of four three
from i are my point you and

i mean it's it's an interesting problem i mean
she phone on

probably going to collecting meetings for a while and freezes
for a while and freezes like we still in addition to just later might be do some different for different persons but this do something different

a little side thing i sent i thought we had and some previous mail has the right join thing to send to which was and it wasn't
so that was that sounds good

which was and g. d. r. c. d. r. hyphen joint wasn't
in this it would probably long lines of fifteen or but they'll find twenty me

and so you w. set it up as a moderated list
and so that the next phase will be will actually doing larger proposal and

and i have no idea whether it actually ever goes to anyone she might want to just mail
no she might want to just mail to mari

so it's amazing you shut up at the meeting good thing because i mean i got my papers done early it is will be interesting
if we end up getting this what will it mean dixie in terms of what we're all the money go to what would be dealing with

up at the meeting it is actually quite amazing
it'll be interesting to see the reviewers comment

and it sounded like they
and it sounded like they the first day was pretty easy is

have to see with the numbers or something like that
pooled pulled open equates and they say they make in the thing

and the large ones are
the t. v. a. might not have too but application may have to

so it'll will be more of them but they found them if we
and this is dealing with mapping on the level of the conversation nothing

none of it will go for these yachts that we've been talking about though i mean
and so forth posted you in here are there any students in your class

brothers evenings in this weekend something
that there would be a new hires and

that are dropping off grants that are ending or the things
and said that we just of digits

that are ending or the things are ending so
there's a continuum need to bring a new things but i see

posted you in here are there any students in your class who are expressing interest
yet to it like they're doing across already here and then and

naming it just brought up the whole issue that hasn't really been resolved about naming so
and count on accuracy during the sparse your face faces because

same number of characters so that when you're sort
but the transcribers every few days off make

the problem as you have you can always search from the beginning or the end of the string you know so's
right so the only thing would change if that's just the directory name and so it's a different set

the problem is that there are a lot of fields of the string you know so's yours are too
the problem is that there are a lot of fields of the string you know so's yours are too

infringing on the speak on the channels and all that
something your frequency they use

every few days off make no one's touching the data and reorganize the file
just so that they're not being overlooked because of that and count on accuracy

and reorganize the file structures and
for speakers and more ass and then three numbers

right so i mean you're dealing with a different domain there and would start and times and all channels
and then the microphone issues we want some weights

and so we just need to naming conventions on that
that's got to be a come especially important once we start changing the microphone setup we have some new microphone

it's just such a shortage gentlest i i will ask how are the transcription
but the news is that i so and

speakers to someone may have only said two words an entire big chunk of over a lot and for
you i you know usage it too and too much of two muscles and

too much time but if it's nine speakers then that is more times it's like you know kind of
what and still not very tall and

it's like you know kind of wondering and i think again
of all the harmonic since that you have to

but those specs also see a problem i think especially me
i think especially if they're really what and still not

you're you're still a mist of what you're doing this and the sky i'm assuming i fell and decided
i fell and decided said jets but

i'd like to talk with you about if
to talk with you about if if they don't have enough time and you want to discuss with someone else some someone else

on it if you compare they something you frequency they they those days go into and we said if to us that they use to until put the let's say they something if i can see it brought
can see it brought it to you come find a. that you something your frequency for they could do more say it outputs it's going to defeat us are being

takes on want maximum
of all the harmonic using that he was it was a multiple of frequency

so if there's more than one speaker or
priority

you know you're saying not distinguishing voice an envoy so
just overall he said all

but the peaks and
and it's they have no time mornings

but to the school or what does it do this way too so do you
but i don't think you can i mean not going to be able to look at every frame so

i mean i really thought that the best way to do it and i'm speaking
way to do it and i'm speaking with no experience in this particular point but

but you look at it you're looking at the second
looking at the second one

what do how's your day in day something frequency
i mean i cost to twelve things but

visit chinese frequency wasn't
frequency wasn't that give you something more like the central frequency of the you know the way most of the energy is i mean

you frequency on i ching day and they'd be six
continue frequency thea

to this intensive kind of normalization
it mean you're right we could remove it they then have two questions

to be working we crash we're not crashing anymore and it really one two three four

or maybe it's once you've done enough meetings one crash on anymore

that's great so learning

so i have agenda in and told me because

so is there any agenda items other than me i actually

right so i'm just going to talk briefly about the n. s. f. i t. r.

if we about transcription i've been but

if we you know we shouldn't at things and just add things and i actually

things and i actually pretty busy day suffolk

starting to define the sound

starting to define the sound like we're doing

so the only thing i would say about digits is we are pretty much done with the first test that there are probably

test that there are probably forms here and there that are marked as having been read that weren't really read so

weren't really read so i won't really know until i go through all transcriber forms an extract out

you know the grouping is completely random so

is completely random so it's perfectly fine to put in a group together again of errors and have

of errors and have them re read

just to finish out the test that

so continue talking string watching and

no it's not much in much physical

it's five or six times out of thousands four thousand

i would take the easy way

it's kind of i mean

it's kind of i mean who knows what studies people be doing on speaker dependent things and so i think

interesting see how many did just have been transcribed

four thousand lines in each line

in each line is between one and about ten digits i didn't on online

digits i didn't compute the average i think the average is

and jane i do have a set of forms which i think you have copies of somewhere true

on i thought i had all bacteria and then the

yes although

although we could switch it back the problem was one

or not either although we could switch it back and tell them always to say easier or always to say

but it's there's nothing natural about reading numbers this way i mean if you saw

i mean if you saw a telephone number you would never see it this way but the problem also

way but the problem also she didn't want to stick with digits and i'm speaking

office space so between them i mean you can

she and i were talking about it and she felt

she's right it's and she felt that it's very natural to do that sort of chung can't

she's right it's it's a different problem i mean it's chung can't

i mean we've done with numbers before and

before and sometimes people say

sometimes people say seen ninety one sometimes people will say certain anyone or theater

or theater any nine one i don't think they do

i don't think they do that but no not very frequently

and since this was something that was asked for specifically i think we need to for her

persons but this is the next suggestions so

so i let me get my things for out about unicef

but then i got some sort of funny mail saying that the moderator was going to that's because

going to that's because they set the one up u. dub that's not

and i have no idea whether

so the moderator actually did we posted

because i had sent one earlier actually the same

you are an atlas right so you got to know

so this is a proposal that we put in before

before on more higher level issues in meetings

this second year if there doing these grants they're

them are some of anyway there are larger grants unusual small in s. f. grants

so they're very competitive and they have

proposal and i hope to be doing very little of it and

the bunch of people working on it

march second i've been a day

so it's amazing you shut good thing because i mean i got my papers done early will be interesting

so it's amazing you shut up at the meeting my papers done early it is

very you said the next phase will be very competitive because we didn't

very competitive because we didn't

have to see with the numbers are or something like that

so maybe it is very weed out as much as usual but it's

but it's usually pretty

how many words are there's you know

and that they have a fair number of them

more than a million and a half more than two million or something like that and we're in the

and we're in the middle

i don't remember but it's probably

line i could be wrong in this it would probably long

thought it was smaller that was like four mindless

big and this time they came in for the middle one so it'll

to what would be dealing with it

you know it none of it will i mean i which part of dixie though i mean

the research right because the other it's higher level

things but they were krista clean oriented things are lower level and this

nothing the conversations

different kind of planes

there's always for everybody there's always things that are dropping off grants

a new things but they're definitely be new students and so forth i see

period i mean we got other than the ones already here

then there's a third is doing a project here who

who but he won't be in country

actually there is one of the guys looking that

you know that's and we sort of person eats next up and it'll

up and it'll mean some more work you know in march and getting proposal often and

it just we've been cutting up sound files in for but with digits and for doing recognition and liz

and liz had some suggestions on naming it just brought

one thing she would like to have is for all the names to be the same length

so that's sorting is easier

so that when you're sort of file names you can easily extract outfits and he's the one that's easy enough to do

m. r. m. zero two things like that

but you know when you do things like that you can always as long

so we have we're going to have to speak grade d. this

information on the microphones your example was really

information on the microphones infringing your example was really

information on the microphones infringing your example was really

and so each one of those as a six blanks sorting becomes a lot easier

so like there was a meeting lengths of fathers are going the same like this recording it

and said that we just don't have that many that's a big deal and of digits

and so at some point we have to sort of take a few days off

when we do that can also rationalize some of the naming

i would think so that the transcribe the transcripts themselves wouldn't need to have such lengthy names

right channels and so

right so the only thing would change if that's just the directory name who i would change them and so it's a different set

so for the meetings and everything about three letters and three numbers from

eating i. d.'s

forth and keep it consistent

we want some weights testifying more than looking into keys file what channel and what mike what channel what mike and what broadcaster or i don't know how to

say it so anyway this one it's this particular headset with this particular transmitter as a wireless and you know that

and you know that one is it different headset and different channel and

so i switched to start

i switched to doing be channel by channel transcriptionist to provide the tighter time bins for partly for you since he was working also it's

i discovered in the process couple of interesting things which

using an interface that has so much more complexity to it

and i watch maybe ask check to help me with some of the questions of efficiency maybe

which is where the real power in their faces and maybe

but with the next when you have an overlap you only have a choice of one start and time for that entire overlap

which means that you're not tightly tuning the individual parts of it overlap by different speakers to someone

but but i was experimenting with doing this by hand and

i did discover a couple of things by doing this on one of them is

as you might expect because when

it's bad back channel could happen in a very densely populated overlap and

and if we're going to study type so we're lots which is what i want

than that really sets require listening to every single channel all the way through the entire length for all the different speakers

asian because maybe we can close and a with without having to actually go to the time that would take to listen to every single channel from start to finish there every single me

very tall and so it can it and all this happened that also the medic detection system is the most them so

i think it's really interesting data to work with i have to say it's

work with i have to say it's very enjoyable

really not a problem spending time with these two really interesting

i it's a short meeting you're

i think into working with him excitement active it and that stevens

of money post people sort of money because

but today doesn't are the worst it that people use it in the paper to distinguish that morning he's has to walk one and

always the snow right say

having a fight scene pool and these people happy

else some someone else besides us that you might want to talk to not be and

people

and i. e. and i took great didn't they the things that they make you seem to fifty

downloading said

downloading said got to you would chain day and then

it kind of sick when she takes and you seemed and they something you frequency

do come find and how it you can set of frequencies that perot probably the that morning and it there are

i'd have to look at that and think about it's

about it's it's i haven't worked of that either so i'm not the

so i'm not the way the simple minded way i suggested was talk was just things that you can make a sieve

let's hypothesize that it's this frequency arafat frequency and

or something but then given those gases try

to get the pitch yes let the beaches got detention

can know but the harmonic they're going to be

and we what you'd like to do is get rid of the effect of the vocal tract right

because the signal coming out of that a lot of

but i don't know you need to open why

what are you doing this for trying

this for trying to distinguish between the case where there is where the where there are more where there's more than one speaker

see if you're also want to just determined feel sort of germ whether it's on voiced then i think you want to look at high frequencies also because

also because the fact that there's more energy and high frequencies is going to be you know sort of obvious to it's enforced

than that i as far as the one person versus two persons it would be primarily low frequency phenomenon

and if you look at the low frequencies yes the higher frequencies are kind of there's going to be a spectrum slope

see t. we typical man i'm pleased

i'm pleased he

ice i mean if meaningful to many dying to understand what happened we took we see so many peaks

i'm i see that morning and many but

point but my impression was the best way to do it was however you fuses teams frequency whatever however you coffee up with your candidates you want to see how much of the energy is in that

and if it's voice

i so you i think maybe the voice and was determination to but

too called the other day that the french he'll say they know you're someone each week they it was it suppose identity and just the tone

you're looking at the

you're looking at the face derivative

what's the main i mean this is this

i mean this is in bands or

he does and then they said from sealed to look for know it's

and you just take the it's and he i just i. e.

and you just take the instantaneous frequency i. e.

muscles and one and they should donate fifty deep cooler fifty

tools posting day with the study got him on each

and to see the energy and the more people are so

on the s. a. t. school pooled pulled

things but say not in the my opinion they then they something if i can see the

the disabled

that it was betting twisting because

twisting because i think so and how they spend too much closer into it today i don't do

i don't do that monique

on went out pride in their whom they will of it

will of it and they that you something if it was he was need equal to competing if you tuned into the if that could

that there about to say people are that the paper

went fuss and it got a great to use and if it's deep day

use and if it's deep day

it's deep day and they

on when i was i just think that it's something you frequency on

see scale use you do a scaling along that axis according to this intensive kind i just

i use these frequency

had that ring chase different different things different

on the paper said that's it these

it these frequencies

mornings

but said they use and holds

basic and it in day

to a great today

they use they hiding window

they said that say these

these big are they are more weeks that

on your frequency both they

what do they teach them

them i do with the bulls defend east on

a couple different say they

they enough between those

and that's what would happen

but which i'm not going to have time to do it states but

states but i'm curious about it

i get it'd agreement this is the return the transfers if there's one third thing

if there's one third thing i wanted to raises it to is an issue which is

an issue which is how to handle breasts

so i wanted to raise the question of whether people in speech recognition want to know what the press are and the

what the press are and the reason i ask the question is
