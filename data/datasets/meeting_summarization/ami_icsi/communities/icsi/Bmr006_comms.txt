hear it like when it's been sitting for a long time so i mean
no what's on pasta or something
but i think that we will cut into people's time someone's on strict time less
so i think we should start doing
i'll back up at
liked it a lot because he's very interested in higher level things like language and just one season all kinds of it maybe positive he's
anyway i thought maybe we should have enough data so that she starts he'd be starting in january next semester that we have you know enough data work with
but gain an atom brought up to a lot of good points that just posting i know to berkeley people have haven't come down here has some problems in that you mean you need to make that the speakers are you want and at the meeting type is what you want and so forth
i mean it's very different if you have a group that just giving a report on what they did that week versus coming to a decision and so forth so
rock hughes from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point too hot hotspots in the meeting or things or is going on that might be important for someone to tend to listen to
and that regard i thought we definitely we will need it'd be for us to have a bunch of date from a few different domain are two different kinds of meetings of this meeting
you know i would feel very strange thing part of i mean that you're in analyzing later for things like summer station
that we're hoping that they'll let us start recording regularly so if that were the case and i think we'd have enough but
enough but for anything where you're trying to get a summer a station or some kind of meeting meaning out of the meeting it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings we didn't really have a good grasp what does it mean to summarize but rather
but rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summary
we just because we have close and distant microphones i definitely agree with
cancun that the issues that i think adam and i raise for more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers
it just simply fluency i mean i deal with
not to mention the fact that i gradually that's just fine purpose
i have a question
they're you know they're just they're assessing whether they should do that or you do something else hopefully over the next few weeks because i mean one
so i know that spaces really scarce on at least in c. s. and
and to actually find a room that we could use regularly might be very difficult you may not need a sucker
i thought so too freelance is good idea i and i think we can get people
i thought so too freelance is good idea i and i think we can get people to come here that
crunchy food
i was thinking lunch after would be lunch afterwards right
that's today would be fun if you're having some planning meeting of some sort and you like maybe right
that's today would be fun and you like right
know novelty item but it also i think builds up towards the gall
right and then they get a c. but just not the same day right
let's see so that was that topic
we and then i another topic will be where we in whole disc resources question for
so it takes a while that's
it takes a while two that's a good point
now what vote is the plan to so will be saved is just you're relocating it i mean so
if we really need to but we have a lot of them and for the full hundred forty hour sets i see
or maybe six so but that's not going to happen instantaneously
the sun had takes more discs then data one did
vendors we buy we of course i mean days
so you're not using all of the data so that's the same before he excluded this that all i fine so
cross plenty of course coalition say he's looking correlation just cross correlation
or even i versus you know and we're catty corner across the table and i'm farther away from this one in your front away from that one
or even if like if people were saying right across from each other you couldn't tell the difference either that one seems like that would be pretty strong crossing it the same axis you don't have as much
right we did we don't have a third dimension there so it's differentiate so much i was just this is going to be there for actually different really very valuable i mean that's
that's on my web pages likely to be any kind of knowledge know you
we could probably regenerate good you know to label it that's
we could probably regenerate good you know to label it that's

background but i liked it a lot because he's
we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and morning meeting so three or four different times see
that's enough so internalized thinking more data but
more data but also data where we sold some parameters concentrate fairly similar like a
mean if we can get more from them fine but if we only get one right
i just think but you know it's like when you get into the graduate level no problem
that the habits already the same phone see
so it's true that we want to be selective in some ways and the way that you're speaking about with not having inter mine and these other issues but on
not enough for others right projects and not enough for others and so i'm looking and thinking
and so i'm looking and thinking i'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it's to help that and my interest in other
right so that and my interest in other people need to do that for themselves or at least discussed that we can find some optimal
you may say you that from transcript of a radio show i mean you don't
radio show i mean you don't even need to speak but
i agree but otherwise you know lots of other states can propose this study so
it won't happen quickly it won't be easy and there's all sorts of issues about you know keeping the equipment safe or else calling it around and also to so then may we should try to
so that's so several times and right i have to leave
that was do you think i think it's east it's whatever that one is i just don't
about two my it's it is interesting to walk in and i know if they much excitement in
you done that already have you done on then that was it of like
the ice tool period to use and i know sluts is just about the media is to use a customer eileen's all and it that's just on and then when it's annoying i really to study what
i probably when you do how fit it's the definition of speech or finance it tore up sewn used to dig thinking you see now we probably we said just i know if they it is and is more they use it see says you sit there and you know my you have to worry about it and but i mean the and she
but it'll be interesting in itself to see but i think that would i haven't no they eat that's it didn't cover sides with the study was days weeds and d. c. the speech i mean speech and we walk is that thirty with it p. d. a. five
and so if you can get again my prescription would be that you would with a mixed signal you would take a collection of possible features look at them look at how these different classes that you parked separate themselves and then collect in tears and i collect ten of them or something and then proceed with a bigger crossfire and you
right that's a good thing to consider there's a complication on that is a
no it's not that so much to it does it the issue is that and then and if they're on the axis
but i don't think that matters though no that's to the p. d. a. so we're going to have a lot of differences with ref perspective
but i don't think that matters though that's we're going to have a lot of differences with ref perspective
that the i'm if they're right next to no
if like if people were saying right across from each other seems like that would be pretty strong crossing
i saw a demo and
and you can zoom writing on somebody right it was all in software and they and i compressed so pretty much
the other thing actually get to this little bit of something else i'd like to do is what happens if you have to be a
i had some things i wanted to talk about with fresh holding i'm doing but i had to make one
minutes so they it be short thing is we have tape recording i'm digitize degree according those
right to change if someone says hey roger so and so that's going
because they naturally speaking or excuse me and via voice it's only one person and so
to them so they'll do something like speaker once because like
this doesn't answer the very efficient
that's a good point which what do you do for discourse tracking because you don't know to know and

that we should have a fair amount of data that is collected for the same meeting so that we can
so i thought about that and i think it's still possible
things like summer station i was meeting about i mean
of this meeting is one of them although
is one of them although i'm not i could participate if i
and then there's mothers that munch that morgan mentioned like the front and meeting
that we're hoping that they'll let us start recording regularly so
similar like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same
the other side to that sake because i don't disagree with that but i think
but i think there's a complimentary piece too
case if you have people who are using english as a as an intro language because they don't they can't speak in their native languages and but they're into language isn't really a match to any existing language model
which includes both top down and bottom
a just be eighteen is because of the consent form you have to
few weeks because i mean one remote possibility is that if we inherited that equipment if she weren't using it could be set up a room in the linguistics department and
the other thing the other thing that i was hoping to do in down here so just just thought of standup not using the
each person who's interested in we have a because we have a bunch of different plants and perspectives on one of these before they need to be taking charge of making they're getting enough of the kind of data that they want
not enough for others right and so in my case i think there were there's enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others
know novelty item but it also it
right see him i will be careful time week
i'm in the midst of doing the p. five was from broadcast news and it took eleven
so i think grew until we got the new disc
it quantity liked it i and market picky enough speech on all the time or they'll droppings don't i cough it
i. e. people too for each frame indicating what kicking it the type what you think class and which if you don't
just kind i see
in we need to @reject@
two of you we'd be paying tools cooled the process till the droppings it is sold with it i know that i was ongoing because
i mean i've seen today and the speech fight it for on the t. v. some by if you curvy you
right you go see this but the store on
they're hidden store on because you squirt dog's club right
they're hidden store on because you squirt dog's club right i it is it but i meet difficulty big chain when did you go to see the that
i mean i've given the goal i mean is that a violation of really i i think it's it's a it's an additional interesting question i mean i think
of course coalition just cross correlation between two sides to cross correlations
so when one person speaking then wherever they happen to be at the point of the sneaking then there's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the lag so
if i was if they're right next to another next one are
on somebody it was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual compressed so pretty much
so is it really you know now in terms of
we could probably regenerate pretty easily from the close talking mikes good you know to label it that's yes i was thinking that attempt

right like the front and meeting and maybe in that working group meeting
not to mention he if he population gradually that's i definitely agree with that i mean for this purpose
not to mention the fact that i would be hesitant certainly could take anyone under eighteen probably even then anyone under twenty one gradually that's just fine purpose
you have to get find their parent to sign for them
to sign for them that's true
another type of me
right but i think you need to i know the pool table routine the but they were it and boom and maurice if you she has this recording process i from like see
right and pro rodeo you know they've
but i think if we want know they've you onto to the court it and she i mean out of all the crass that it continuous u. t. u. you and it eat agree it and basic word to it the book they it up if they said phone saying some people are on do you have poop recall don't do we say it just kind also it'd be like
but on the other hand it's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus satisfy all of it so it's
of it so it's pretty examples that we want to have a fair amount it's done with a small not recorded with a small tight number of types of meetings
it but what about for these issues of summer as a nation a lot of these higher level things you don't really need a distant microphone
so i'm not whether they'll still be so willing to volunteer but all
right i'd love to get people that are not linguistic were engineers these are both weird
you're talking to but i personally would not want my meeting but
i was looking at the roar data and first look at it there were three directors on there that could be moved one
one was called the roar one with spanish with carmen spanish and the other one was spine
meeting so you know we have a couple of weeks
of that we should put it onto the broadcast news one that's probably
my eighty eighth to walk i
own i mean its own see sofa speech ill say i want to speak of we south they need a you know he say any kind of close even do that and you know and he's notes and speech give a speech
do you put that the question
about two it and did this the having to sit i you're just trying to understand we just wanted to know what the category was here
first i think is probably decision this is untrue if you're really wonder what different if
probably i you were neck poop that to prove
him over to beat that what tomorrow is the most i could be pushy or that just it was bullshit she worked that denmark the chain
i'm not what dan's pages you mean he was looking at that to cross correlations pretty sensitive you take a signal from the two microphones his what page
i mean what if it were about to wind down i think
i mean what if it were about to wind down i think what i would prefer is that we have the lady in out of the station thing till next week and i would like to
but we haven't specified to them so they'll do

working lunch was your for
and that way if we're recording somebody elses meeting and the number the participants have to run off to some other meeting don't have the time then they can run off and they will get
really need to close microphone mean like i think there's
i it could just be fun you know if nothing else you know novelty but it also
and then with the broadcast news that's five or six more meeting so you know we have
don't but so we could just do that at the end of today wants the archive is completed and i verified it
a house and some audience and it
what these days it took a few of the defendant beach in future it took us to fight the speech on or up and speech
so you intend to hand hey it you been to it which it and have said it how it affects all the just to type i mean day man
yes that's everything before for i don't know you not marked you know it's not in that
model it they specify is all they all do it picked the deciding crass to the defendant's owns before type tool park when i say we said the task life we say it's difficult i said
you'll get a feeling for what's happening you know so if you look
so if there's too and if they're multiple people talking the lag so whatever angle you are at some like corresponding to the time difference between the two there you get this boost in the cross correlations are auction
so if there's too at some like corresponding
that the i'm let me ask you if both people are over there it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across catty corner no
if i was here and working was there and we're both talking it wouldn't work right another next one are in over on this side of the p. d. a. there we go down the same what i'm asking
if i was here and working was there and we're both talking it right another next one are in over on this side of the p. d. a. there we go down
i saw a demo and if you do that then you can really get
should i mean i have some results to percent but i mean i won't have time to do that this time but
this time but it seems like be anonymous sessions is also something that we might want to discuss in greeley
i what i said so so in within the context of an utter and someone says so roger what do you think

no it i need is and what he did to or they open up consultants have to be i
i would say we did talk about the in he ended couple of you know the money is duration
and and it these information yea we say except that he's paying marks if flew about the psalms that's consultant on it because it beauty speech is because of its own i mean
but it's almost on you know these aren't all cute but
but it's almost i think what you're talking about is there's two things as a sensitivity these aren't all cute but
in line sort of pathological or someone just happens to be sitting yes
and i think dan is still working on it so he actually i'm not trying to argue against using it by any means i just wanted to point out that weakness that it's top logically impossible to get a perfect everybody
you know put tens of microphones and
know what you need to do is you have little fabric thing you enroll and hang on the wall has all these mics set up
and we're just and they're different ways of people approach it and i think we should
and we're just we're getting updated now that it sort of like to do it now before i get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it i think we should
right you don't want to do that we don't we want to we had we want to transfer to be roger then it seems to me that maybe it seems to me that if you change the name the task is going to disagree with thee audio won't be able to do that
right you don't want to do that we don't we want to we had we want to transfer to be roger thee audio won't be able to do that
right you don't want to do that we don't we want to we had we want to transfer to be roger because we thee audio won't be able to do that
because we made that the transcript be the tag that we're using for roger somebody read the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between you know on of my same in the real name and we want to avoid that and and
the real name and we want to avoid that's a good point and and nicer and i have so i mean the question then becomes one level back how important is it for a person to be done five by first name versus
full
name
notice i heard to make it up but if no
how would if no told me things and i'm just proceeding from my is in and abs ended up with your i am just always asking jose what he's doing you know and so it's that this the other things going on always something from my i just couldn't do ten minutes
you should just teaching you chain you take was that

it to i mean it's a remote possibility then you know one of us who don't go out there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here so just
right now that they didn't learn weird we need a wider sampling
the problem with engineers as we they
that makes any sense that
let makes any sense that the other thing is that we could talk about is giving them burning extra c. d. rom and give
let them have the meeting and give them a so if they
that's put that to the transcript screenplays anyone
in the future they in the past so this is such
the first things to build something else detected overlaps right
i saw a demo and if you do that
all sorts of interesting things you can do with that i mean not only can you microphone
me so if i'm saying in a meeting when bob by the way wanted to do so and so
me so if i'm saying in a meeting when
they're just going to rise bob wanted is if you're doing you're just going
and so if you were they won't be able to themselves

i agree but i think that he we can't really underestimate the difficulty it's been really do understand the difficulty of getting a up like this up this study so
is there another backed up disk that you know of that we should put it onto
yes so are you planning to do that or have it but they it you my opinion we need it a game on offense this issue to live on weights and did the door
in like one percent it would be the eight signs saying we helped to any at least which means that we still
least means that we still easy yes that's
the fans we got there by that i it easy yes that's interesting this is like a ground level it's not
so you intend to hand mark those and exclude them
i'm you said it more motion
two it i there i would do i take just
i take just a few features instead of taking all the messy caesar all the p. l. p.'s whatever i think a couple
like she wants you to something like that so that you can visualize
because it before you do build up any kind of sense a class of fires just take a look in two dimensions and how these things are split apart
for about if you're going to use and a speech like when i said it broke crass on upper class tools to tied to and rather than for friends i seen day hike keep dating and all be t. stadium would be enough to keep it did change probably

right now that they didn't learn weird we need a wider sampling
or i have to meet with stefan so
but i if i'm moving from a roars on the d. c. desk that was i don't remember i think it's
do you think one is i just don't remember it might be d. c. and
i thought fan through some of those might walk changing to that stays think
stays think you for information to say athletes and the that i said they said hey walking my house and in that delays and sinking pleading and it's a thing about the mechanical and put it
context and so if you just looking at frame of time you don't know anything about you know the structure of it overtime and so you may want to build his feel the market model of some sort or else have features that really are based on on some bigger chunk of time i think it's a
i think it's a good place to start
but don't but anyway that's my suggestion is don't just you know throw and twenty features at to deltas adult and all that into some classify or even if it's scanners neighbors you still won't know what it's doing even you know center and that
i think to know what it is to have a better feeling for was doing you want to look at it
i it didn't do the beacon to go to please do for me how's it true you know hasn't said a boxer or just the face because it
no too i'm just saying that the way we're seated around the table is not the same with respect to each person with respect to the p. d. a. so
of like how confused is it a is it

you did that by hand that it
the speech i know that if the study is speech especially speech with something overlapping which could be speech but doesn't need to be
is in the future they used to posting thickness to this is such
is you to the or the information you mentioned i don't think we're asking for that
took it too but she fight
what sort of seems that because they it's who to study what these dick onto ocean off allstate each but i me too through the process wolf but she fight court t. v. to defend pocket
what sort of classify fire and it
so they do i mean i think the other thing i want to i mean this is i think a good thing to do to sort of look at these things at least two it i
so if the sensitivity is good enough and we just don't have enough experience with it to know how it
and so that's going to stay that person's name now in terms
you one that would be a very practical solution on their part and

where you want it on campus and she just posted granted like undergrads i think you get such a mixed bag that would be hard to know how much conversation you have at all and then the english you'd have would that language models would be really hard to build because it would not really
where you want it at all and then the english you'd have
but it embrace next i think it's relevant exactly for this idea out there that if you think about gee we have this really complicated setup to do maybe you don't
it's a lot of day tape copy from one place and have it to another person that
that i think it's like a signal noise situation
but said what's it what is maybe i was supporting i
right you can't analyze it when these kind of it and eat festive custody voting took on this cup and they said if hopping to comes too kind it what was into the somebody that's it you
right you can't analyze it what was
like using something simpler first i think is probably this is untrue if you're really wonder what

but these as you deaf and one to make that kind of group that you're getting is the right groups you don't waste a lot
you don't want to mention subjects by name and publish reports now be very possible
once now be very possible for me to take those data put them in a study and just change everybody's name for the purpose of the publication and someone
i realize they're doing is that i didn't realize that you had a bunch of things if you want to talk about
and so i was proceeding some somewhat a random frankly so
frankly so i think what would be helpful would be it and now i'm to was men dressed too that before the meeting if anybody could send me any agenda items that they were interested in and i'll take the role of organizing into the agenda
really this i mean they're going to say speaker the i'm betting we're going to have huge chunks that are just on i'm transcribe by him
i mean they're going to say speaker the secret to tuesday i mean i'm transcribe by him

he comes from a signal processing background but i
and then we need a couple that of we don't want to just have one group because that
right that's very easy but that's not the
easy but that's not the corpus that we're collecting actually
actually that's it raises an interesting point they can our discussions maybe worth repeating
i mean is that a violation of i think
we can do whatever we want study

need and you got to go home with and it's actually
with and it's actually it's probably going to be pretty useless too
but you'll appreciate you know where it's useful in where it's useless and then right
so i did a bunch of archive thing and still doing a bunch of our kiting i'm in
and so they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of or something we
and a data go got bought by another company and doubled their prices
so there was plenty of disk

so let's see we were having discussion the other day i mean we should bring that up about the nature of the data they were collecting
we have a lot of overlap so group because that might be very specific to that particular group but three or four different times
so that will give us ten gigabytes of free space they are
i cough it two hundred on seventeen the mower assailant up about songs on seen female food to this information because we
to this information because we
because we could program i close the information close calls it tells you i mean we in my niece him fish and my

you know but you know i think i've been i've gathered data from undergrad at on campus and she
i was thinking more in terms of talking to professor's and senior i didn't and doctoral students who are leading projects in our friend to them that they have to hold their meeting down here that's the interesting i see interesting that's i think i agree
i was thinking more in terms of talking that's i think i agree
and interesting
no you don't waste a lot of your time in the overhead of bringing people down
if you use the rae rather than signal from just one

be but exactly my point in my not to lose was i think undergrads are if he population i definitely agree with that
what if you could tell him he'll give them the transcripts when can that we might need a little more intense
tree that's just usually good but
because the future you were it right tool to process that so owned we've we're know of a speech work when i show multiples
was ongoing because it's pool thing to taxation sunday you see man if i were on in in a month hispanic when i said but
i sold it didn't they deceased and we huff two modems

because of the consent form you have to get find their parent
so then i the laughing and having my agenda was just to hear her update on what's because it's been doing so
if you're not pure with it would be much you know they're awful you i think which and i
right so like going he's funny
and i would like to you know what is your opinion and it
and we i think i think it's not a it's not at all unreasonable it makes sense

i need to that is that it is mark well-to-do fed into his own
be close i eat i one to days is for each frame and other indicate can you say is that supper like and today cook resting and forces i. e. i.
i'm training and validation and that's it i we've because they're he's right
it i'm i prefer i worked ferret did too took off they had these other about what thirty bucks it
any truth bucks it and for needs
because what we had before for speaker changed action did not include these overlaps so

and you could you know noisy room they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom writing on somebody a ten by ten ray and they had very precision right it was all i compressed so pretty much
that's what i'm asking
look it's and i think in on the station if you want to pursue that now i just think that's a discussion which also really deserves a lot you know more than just a minute i really do
once you get to the publication you can certainly do that you can you know name on the one hand it's not a full agenda density we're taking all these precautions and they'll be taking precautions which are probably even the more important wants to they'll be reviewing traffic seats or something they don't like so maybe maybe that's enough protection on the other hand this is a small pool and people who say things about topic x. e. who are researchers and known in the field they'll be done a viable it simply from the from person however taking one step further back they did in the bible anyway even if we changed all the names so is it really you know now in terms of like so i did some results are so report on next time which i do mention individual speakers by name now they're the human subject to me is very precise you don't want to mention subjects by name and publish reports now be very possible for me to take those data put them in a study and just change everybody's name for the purpose of the publication and someone who looked
but that's because i'm focus so much on the acoustic six instead of on the discourse and so i think it's a really good point
and so if you were if you're doing discourse analysis how am i they won't be able to themselves

i mean we really want to have a substantial amount recorded this way that's what we did
as a sensitivity issue and then this a pathological liar this year
they both have these you know the bigger race on the wall and you know if
the wall has all these mics and it has a plug in jack to the p. d.
they just back at this to make a brief comment about thee the what we're covering in a meeting i realize they're doing

send him e. mail and ask of on the free don't know about the free lunch
of on the free and they'll say there's no
how would the person who doing the transcript even know who they're talking about
the person who's doing the transfer debbie and people
mean so how was that information going to get labeled anyway how do you mean what

that's a very good point so we can right so could burn it after it's been cleared with the transcript stage and then they
especially because i'm generating a clone also so
now i mean we were at a hundred percent and we dropped down to eighty six for reasons i don't understand someone
someone deleted something somewhere and so
somewhere and so we have some room again and then

now we're on and it seems to be working lunch was your for there we go strange
now we're on and it seems to be there we go strange
but he just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine i thought accuser
i thought accuser not going to happen so

and so forth so then i was talking to morgan about new propose work in this area service separate issue from what student would be working on where i was think of doing some kind of summers nation of meetings are trying to find cues in they irises and then the other into patterns like in
it's that the habits already burnt and but fluency the same phone see
let them have the meeting and give them a so if they want to want audio record of there i thought that was i
want audio record of there i thought that was i thought he meant give them a music c. d. like big t. v. the other and i it

first place i don't think we just want to have random people come down and talk to one another i think there should
that's the first one the second point
to come here we're set up for it
they can't do that the current ones they don't do speaker identity

first one the second point is
i think that for some time now it's going back to burp i think that we have had speakers that we've worked with who had non native accents and i think that i'm not saying accents the access not the
and i think i'm not saying accents
and if people want to approach

that's pretty much what you're going to have in the networking or scenario and
because they're part of the network group is almost entirely germans in spanish but the thing
but the thing is i think the these people are of high enough level in their language proficiency it and i'm not checked
it and i'm not checked into accents i'm

to do that we need to find some on campus was interested in this right but
might be very difficult that's true you may not need a sucker you know the idea
teachers we do it from mission we have things on d. c. and used to study is it i mean that we they said that but i mean to right to hit the books they cut us off each frame for busy friends so
know maybe it doesn't matter so much so

what if you could tell no i think that's a great idea actually that we might need a little
in would be good to see information they i say it and i cough and other for each day if frank i'm it with a customer yea i wouldn't i eat on we need to @reject@
bad right but you know the future bartman and i have to because you can generalize did that be checking the war but he went on
when i said but i he stadium

for that because my maybe i still to study studies and they stepped but i meet us and it's it more i'm more these teeny mean it's too they actually fight
i should get the digital camera that they they said they would use maybe it's it because you fight
and so in their current conventions there are no multiple speaker conventions so
conventions so it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words i think

the fans we got there by that i it i mean interesting this is like a ground level it's not all the time
in i don't hi guys that guys that's it's it's
i don't guys that guys but that's it's it's true that it also it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis where you're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases
that's i it i would actually kind of like it's too winded down see if we can still at the end of the birthdays thing there

but steady state noises are part of the background which can be
silences just sort of the background acoustic
it actually you can do sensitivity analyses which show you what the importance of different parts and pieces you put their it's hard to what
like using something simpler

what's the written or no phone can each interested
they need it's slightly different
i should've checked this morning we didn't sign anything because she said if anybody had signed it or do we have to slightly different
i should've checked with jane first of the check the form is changed so we it or do we have to slightly different

because they people are it and different groups of houses and say we just kind of thrown in is that he's not p. c. and to consult because you i mean
are probably better that i things like carmen this day and
i that would put to that they know you it this day and residual energy are
this is all pretty early stages but now you have to be

that i think in terms of so you can stick your clothing
patterson @reject@ in terms of the research that research it's really whatever the person who's doing the research wants to do so
do so if jose is interested in that's great but if
i had a couple things that i did want to bring out one is so

it is but all i know is that it seems like every time i am up here after a meeting and i start it works fine
and if i'm up here in i started and we're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting it gives me that error message and
fixing to get news write it down me that error message and i have not yet sat down with been able to get that error message the point where i can sit down and find out where it's occurring in the code

and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on the state central avenue this new student does want to work with us the guy that was
what do they that's out by a woman which category like
i deal able to have a wall filled with him but i mean i can see the value

funded part-time so we'll be paying him only for us half of the normal part-time
right so like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway
right things because it's so expensive to put together

patterns like in numbers of overlaps i'm amount of speech rock
we realized in discussion that the other thing is about this business of distant and close microphones i mean we
and if they're multiple people talking you'll see two peaks the cross correlations are auction it's spread out

skills not tank and i see the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that
to volunteer but all send him e. mail and ask of on the free don't know about the free lunch
and look at these different examples and look at scatter plots

know just the idea of computational linguistics and probably the grammar is and all may not be the folks this group
if you have a choice between people who are probably more precision in it more fluent more close to being academic english then it would seem to me to be a good thing
because otherwise you don't have the ability to have

maybe john and i just put it in and smell it on or something
i think it's not out of the question
i think it would be interesting because i we could regularly get another meeting

you don't it doesn't you just need some microphone somewhere which one did you mean don't really even need any fancy max fun can you can
tape recorder doesn't you just need some microphone somewhere max fun can you can use found day you
he's a microphone but can you

it around and also to i think the first priority so then may we should try to bring people here i mean that's
i think the first priority should be to get try to get people to come here we're bring people here i mean that's
think the first priority should be to i mean that's

the room is really under used
i thought so too freelance i thought the free lunch idea was a great idea right
you want to look at some picture that you're issue here's these things our for some separation

i was thinking lunch after would be lunch afterwards right
too that just it's and they have to do their digits or they don't get dessert
too that just it's you don't get their food or they don't get dessert

and i it depends on what audience you're talking to but
and then also anonymity how we want to on him eyes the data
hopefully if someone

assigned by hand based on i it i i put people to not like on because
i'm training and validation on because maybe i he said either suspicion i need it to be that the formation and that's it i we've because they're he's right because it you see notes it i we've i we it over to this speech fired upon lies look at the brawl earns it i'm
that's on my web pages do all sorts of interesting and they communicate with each other and then you know they're in random positions the likelihood that i mean it wouldn't be any likely to be any kind of knowledge know you know too it three or four

that's it you say independent to see like what they be about the you don't know what's hopping and you can deal with an it actually
but we don't even know yet what the effect of detecting having ability teaneck overlaps is you know maybe it doesn't matter so much
is you're just going right dog

you know so if you look at suppose you look at first and second order castro coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first orders much more effective than the second you know you look at the third there's not and not too much there you may just take first second orchestral coefficients right
and without p. c. i think i'll p. c. per se is tell you much more than and then the other maybe
and on the other hand l. p. c. residual energy and you know p. c. residual say how you order l. p. c. model setting in which should be pretty poorly for two more people speaking at the same time it should be pretty for one and

i now have ten likely candidates and then you can do decision
i've and then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they come by
but it anyway because i was and all that is this i've said to till too

very mixed the speech that makes
mixed that makes a speech it next you
right white because they're this but to she's moving and it's pretty pretty much korea they flew clampitt with it p. d. a. the

if because it and they that the d. a.'s messy
because it and they know you say too is because they segment annoys the ratio in these days so a.'s messy
i think that's a good way to start so i don't know

and you can get that to work then you go to the other signal
and you know they won't work as but how you know how much and then you can re
but i think it would be interesting and then you can re off the mines and so

but i think it would be interesting and then you can re off the mines and so
but i think it would be interesting to try a couple with both
because i will be interesting to see if some teachers work with close mixed in i don't hi guys that guys that's it's it's

is that not allowed and so that's
is that not allowed that's
i mean no i mean we don't have any rules really i

and in his case mean he's closer to it anyway it seems to me that
i don't know but it's another source of information i think i but for me i get they it seems to me that it's not you know is this the top potter apology of it is a little bit
but it's another source of information i you know is this the top potter apology of

cross plenty of course coalition he's looking correlation just cross correlation between two sides
i'm not what dan's to cross correlations pretty sensitive
subtracting you take a signal from the two microphones and you any cross correlate them with different blacks

if they're close it's just a question of the and if there so it's just the two of you guys on the same side
if they're close it's just a question of the sensitivity and if there so it's just the two of you guys on the same side
and we don't want i don't think you understood what i said so

and i think dan is still working on it top logically impossible
so he actually he wrote me about it a little bit so to get a perfect everybody great no
so i mean the other thing you can do great no i don't mean just for show

that's what i that's not what are the constraints right that's
that's the constraint of one question that i think both adam and i were interested in
big but you know if you can instrument a room this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing it some people

think that because you raise a couple of possibilities yourself you and i discussed
you and i discussed it previously and they're
and it was and we made the decision that was kind of artificial i mean for going

going in dealing with it it's just ever
came i'll give you the short version but i do think
but i do think that it's an issue that we can't result in five minutes

now in terms of like the transcript the question
the question becomes what symbol are you going to put in there for it everybody's name and whether you're going
and whether you're going to put it in the text where he says hey roger we're going to put that person's anonymous name in instead

on the one hand it's not a full agenda density we're taking
a full agenda density we're taking all these precautions and they'll be taking precautions which are probably even the more important wants to they'll be reviewing traffic seats or something they don't like so maybe
so maybe maybe that's enough protection on the other

fixing to get news write it down it's occurring in the code
one of these days was it applies what's on pasta

up at the previous at last week's meeting this meeting i was right and how about wanting to get more data and
to get more data and i talked about the fifteen and adam

the guy that was at the last meeting
and you know p. c. the thing that sickly look at is i think is something like the residual energy the residual

but maybe that's enough so
i deal able to have a wall filled i think it's i can see the value

think if you just say and in particular my suggestion wise to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you have sought people who would have proficiency enough in english that i would be useful for purposes you know but
so if you have a bunch of if he like that's the worst possible case if you have people

i think there should be a meeting that has some colin point because i think that's where we're investigating so it has to be it a preexisting
big micro room the race it some people that at it brown

that the access not the problem
no it's more a matter of proficiency it just

it just talking about at all you're just talking about
so i know that spaces really

and i think if it's a preexisting meeting and it's held in english i think it's probably if a few of the people don't have not particularly good english skills not
for one and so i again if you take a few of these things that are promising features and look at them in pairs i think you have much more of a sense of i now have doing a bunch of these analyses i now have

into accents i'm just thinking that we have to think at a higher level view could we have a language model a grammar that would be a possibility so
possibility so you so if you want to bring them i like down draft he's model and do some top down it to help the bottom up in merced things or whatever it seems like i don't see that there's an argument i'm what i think

but we can also have another part that's just one or two meetings of each of a arrange of them that's
arrange of them that's too

for some of it maybe if really all you want is to have a recording that's good enough to get a transcription from later you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording i mean we right
we are getting another just crack and for thirty six good practice

could it that machine and i agree with tina though on the other hand it
so that maybe truth you may say for instance summer station or something that sounds very language oriented you may say

it up there start something simple you throw away a lot of these dimensions then you can do that right away talking about something
talking about something that has all of these different facets we have here

should i pursue that
so they originally definitely

that's right now that they didn't learn weird other daily these are both weird we need a wider sampling
that's other daily

if you're having some planning meeting but maybe maybe right
that's today would be fun if you're having some planning meeting of some sort and you like maybe right

and then we're going to move this technology so it's become useful no i think that's
they can't be internal one that's right although it's never go i like that put that otherwise they're not allowed to play it for anyone

what if you could tell him he'll give them the transcripts when that we might need a little more intense
anyways have the transcripts so i would point that i have to add to it i raise a that's interesting

and it took eleven hours to do to copy it
where did you copy it too and it'll take another eleven to do the clone

on the tape cellmark arriving and then i'm going to delete files so that will
so one thing the goodness about that is that once archive it's pretty quick to get back i mean it

and so one that will be done like in about two hours and so
we are getting more space we are getting another

right especially i mean it the other directions fast but distractions really so
those are different prices and what

copies one off going on site
and so we're looking into other vendors we

is that the one and that's probably not for about four meetings so
it's wherever the meeting recorder currently as i think it's t.

i often don't of my head but so we
you have to find you come find day and i'm not you come find

and it because you which is itty bitty useful because i'm
they're the jewish and i but for me glad to hear that here

do a lot of consultants inclination with it speech is owned the ice
on my you said you were in pristine to cough and take one percent in like

there by that i it i mean they know you say take top said they creeps say good to be friends and it's not all the time
i mean i've given the goal i mean is that really i

i have to mark i mean and that's no thinking eighteen when you know or the it was a fight or the
was a fight or the it i found say i don't really like what does it is it quantity liked it

he says was just starting with needs i ask you so
with i ask you so the difference between the top two is so

so start the bombs assignments is clear by speech
speech by speech do you mean speech by once one person only this

like by the moment job breath or clicking overlapping with speech so that
it in defense moment because it and it i have information is it opened up his own information about cities they ill probably sony said from the speech korea speech from the walk into it just because fish because at least he's somewhere where then but it's so to speak to learn a lot today know on to it the speech i know that if the study is speech especially speech with something overlapping

so you're not using all of the data so that's the same before he excluded this that all i fine so
you're not using all of the data same before he excluded this that all i it's have three

it that's fine here knowing overlapping events unless there's speech speechless speech
i saw one that was like and if you do that then you can really get very kind of selectivity

about two it and did this the having you're just trying to understand we just wanted to know what the category
is your silence category pure silence or what if would just yet

or what if there was a door slam
know modal so is it just one cluster per we would i'm always a keystone into took you see man seen and sick i knew noticing that a and it seems that says

or what if there was a door slam or something no he's pure
or someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it and if there so

pure with it would be much you know they're awful i think which and i think what you mean is that it's non speech segments that don't have impulsive noise
right just usually good but the thing is here he's not he's not like he has won a bunch of very distinct variables like pitch in this he's talking about like all these control coefficients of too much case

the second thing is once you actually get to the point of buildings the fires what this black so far as the top rope properties so if you just looking
one of the she's too it to be picked the chain of chain

because i but so we should go for transition of silenced overlap versus the transition from silence to speech is going to be a big informative area there it seems to me
i think that's a good way to start i don't know

because the transition from silence to speech
some for that's i but i eat he sees mighty omission both it with the pug it area there it seems to me

i'm not you come find in day and what's changed
but it i understand that to you would you do if these two big classified condone that's it that's old note he's or do you use own in dating to fired that's it took off so they about two huff too pooper know but it just overlap so

i'm i didn't understand know are i'm mole all said i molds that i but it said i'm over there real small arms simple molds to type a fight date and defense us
i'm i didn't understand what you said what

it'll be interesting in itself to see and we walk is that thirty
but i think that would be an interesting result five it what i mean what did

it makes sense to start with the simpler signal
because if you have features which don't aren't even helpful in the high signal no and there's no point putting them into posten ratio one i think anyway and

speech five bucks it what does is it innovation know they shouldn't that four months when you use in there and it speech fire they p. d. a. speech fives and
i'll watch it's i see need to would be time

to see the i suppose that's another
was better use and very complex ones because more reliable chuck was going to ask something

was chuck was going to ask something
this is a dumb question but

is a dumb question but i thought it would be i thought would be easier if you use the p. t. a. because
p. t. a. because can you couldn't use like being forming or something to detect speaker

stages but now you have to be right that's a good thing to consider there's a complication
stages but now you have to be right that's

no it's not that so much to does it the issue is that and then
no it's not that so much to but does it the issue is that and then and if they're on the axis of that's the other thing i think he you in this last time

i but if you said from abusive interesting media to take of studies and invade iran and prone and with information because i found difference between the speech phone from each maaco and p. d. it's
timing difference it's just appliqued right i you know i mean set herself

timing difference it's just appliqued right so i you know i mean set herself i mean i know
so i mean i know it's very important too i'm just i'm

being that this is generated being patter and then it looks more like it's multiple wherever
wherever you are even if he moves around it just

it just seems to me that that this isn't the ideal type of separation and
i think what you're talking about is there's two things as a sensitivity issue and then this a pathological liar this year so that the one where someone

i mean the other thing you can do that if i mean we're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody could somebody to put to two microphones in the p. d. a. but he had put a i don't mean just for show
and you could you know noisy room they could a ten by ten ray and they had very precision

and they're much broader we can n. because they stipulation vacation seem but that's i mean what we can watch all of this is their first study
and they're much broader i mean what

or the thing is one at least one of
and you could you know noisy i saw one that was like a hundred microphones a ten by ten ray and they had kind of selectivity

was it was interesting but the reason why haven't focused on that as a for my first concern is because i'm interested in what happens for people random people out in some random place where they're having impromptu discussion and
for work who sticks you don't but to know you do

i still like my rug on the wall so it's it would be
i still like my rug on the wall i if anybody passing that so it's it would be but i think in so

want to bring out one is due any sign newbies again it's really different so
newbies again it's really different so i would say it would be a good idea

so it sounds like they're a couple technical things people like to talk about my only just
take that i just like to talk about my only just a couple minutes to briefly to them and then and then and then we i would prefer

transcript i think you don't they're filming to be and
and in the form that they signed it does say your first name may arise the course the meetings

so again it the issue is if you're tracking discourse things if someone says frank said this and then you want to connected to something later you've got to have this part where that's prank call or your name
and you know even more he immediate than that just being able to it just seems like to track from one daughter in et cetera two speaking and who's speaking to home because that can be importance

like i'm thinking be importance you know you raised the point so on so it's kind of to who u. s. and i and
like i'm thinking too much who u. s. and i and actually remember

like i'm thinking too much who u. s. and i and actually remember for them remember last time we had this discussion of how you know i was sort of avoiding mention people's names
names and it was

you're right this is going to require more thought
but i'd be very pleased to have everyone else completely make up the agenda notice i heard

ended up with your always something from my
i am just always asking jose what he's doing you know i just couldn't do ten minutes

long transcript of a bunch of words i think that my understanding from in is inching
sequencing you

you should just teaching you chain you take was that
should was that they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that we discussed where they put speaker died in a fire down but you know how

but you know how they won't know these people so i think
people so i think it's what else they'll dobson convention but we haven't specified

and it may will have to review the transcript in any case
and it may very be i mean since they're not going to sit there and worry about being the same speaker they may very go the the first time it changes to another speaker they'll be secret to the next in any case

the close talking mikes so but i mean that doesn't yes i was thinking that attempt the time values of when it changes
so but i mean that doesn't this doesn't answer the question the time values of when it changes very efficient

one of these days was it applies what's on pasta

so that so the the new procedural change just got suggested i think it's a good idea is that we do they did recordings at the end

and they will get so much somewhat fewer such as digits but

and he's already funded part-time so we'll be

and what interested in specifically so he comes

positive he's getting it's even in that anyway i thought

one offs but i'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about in here then sort of missed much of a bunch of one time

just because it would be very hard too process the data in all senses boats

boats to get the figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it like i was talking to morning about

meeting we've only had three see i've never listened to the data for the fun and meeting

we've only had three so and meeting

know that i mean just you the other side to that

for other kinds of research particularly the acoustic oriented research i actually feel the opposite me

i'd like to have lots of different people right

as many people hear it and talking about that kind of things that you're just talking about you would have thought too few people from my point you know i'd like to have many different speakers right

know i'd like to have many different speakers

so i think i would also very much like has to have a fair amount really random scattered beating somebody coming down to campus and i mean if we can right

fine but if we only get one or two from each group still could be useful could stick we just because we have close and distant microphones for different people cancun i definitely agree with

to build because it would not really be could be dinner language rather than

right we're investigating so i was it has to be it a preexisting meeting like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway that's i think

you're not talking about foreign language i mean i deal with people on campus who i think sometimes people undergraduates in computer science have language skills that make you know that they're fluency in the writing skills are not so strong

it just you're not talking about foreign language at all you're just talking are not so strong

it just talking about at all you're just talking about

then we're completely gone i mean i'm not saying accents i'm saying

then we're completely gone it's i mean i'm not saying accents i'm saying fluency

we're completely gone it's i'm saying fluency

i think that i think the only thing that we should in the advertisement is that the meeting should be in english

which is that there's this issue you have a corpus out there should be used for multiple things because it's so expensive

so i know you know just the idea

but the idea of language models which are fun you know generally speaking you know terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data if you

that's the worst case scenario

i i'm what i think is that why not have the corpus so expensive to put together useful for the widest range of central core things that people generally use corporate four and which are you know using caucasian linguistics

that's which includes both top down and bottom up

what we can get i mean it's i think that if we're aiming at groups of graduate students and professors and so forth are talking about things together and it's on the berkeley campus probably most of it be but yes that's fine exactly my point in my not to lose

so forth are talking about things together that's fine

not to mention the fact that i gradually that's just fine purpose

they're you know they're just they're assessing whether they should do that question maureen you were mentioning that mari may not use the cook equipment from i. b. m. if they found something else because

and i mean there may be a lot more or insight crank wherever and other building where we could record people there i think we have a better

i think we have a better chance

i think we need a real motivated partner to do that we need to find chance right but

but if they're worth it to i mean

right the other thing the other thing that i was hoping to do in the first place was to turn into some kind of portable thing so could we went around just thought of standup not using the

that's true maybe john you know the idea is if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth and if one of us up there to record the meeting once a week or something

i think if we want to just record with the tabletop microphones that's easy kind also it'd be like

realize that we're talking about this said there's these different things i want to do it so

really need to close microphone you mean like i think there's you actually

you mean you don't it doesn't you just need some microphone which one did you mean you actually don't really even need any fancy max fun

you don't it which one did you mean don't really even need any fancy

he's a microphone but can you but i think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect each person

i mean we could have a fairly could it that machine and i agree with tina though

but what you what i was thinking as long term what would be needed to be able to pick up on but

special not going to happen so i do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of interest and have this parallel information which is really what makes this purpose powerful otherwise you

i agree otherwise you know lots of other states can propose this study

and so i it took quite a while to get that togetherness will just do it up there start

i had i spoke with some people up it cost business school who volunteered should i pursue

so they originally they decide not to do go into speech so i'm not whether

up towards the gall are saying look you know you're going to get this is not

so i would i have to add to that's interesting

i would point that good point i have to add to it i raise a he seems to concern about doing that giving them the c. d. immediately because of these issues of you know this kind of or maybe you know interesting

that's a very good point so we can so could burn it after it's been cleared

that's right that's a good point right it should be the same c. d. rom that we distribute publicly right

right they can't be internal one although it's never go publicly right otherwise they're not allowed to

that's true things have been weeded out otherwise we need to

true things have been weeded out otherwise we need to lawyer stages

true things have been weeded out say otherwise we need to lawyer stages

say i got the c. d. and your honor i

so that's so several times and right i have to leave i will be careful

we are slowly getting to the point where we have enough room to record meetings for

did you copy it too to do the clone

that but so it's just but it's a lot of day copy from

on the tape i did narcotics cellmark i'm

on the tape i did narcotics cellmark i'm

free space and they are cutting programs does take a long time

and so at that point will be able to record five more meetings so one

no it i mean so we're going to get more disk space or did

the these are the key files from broadcast news which are regenerate able regenerate bull if good i see

the sun iraq takes one took foreign one took six or maybe it was eight and twelve whatever was it was you know fifty percent more

prices and i what happened is that we bought all the racks and just for mandated go for years according to days and a data go got

and so i wrote to dan and he was very concerned that be spine was moving to a non backed up desk so

so i realize that what probably not all of that treatment just c. d. rom type it the static data so

data so i moved that and then i ask him to check out and see if it was for actually

for actually deleted the old i haven't heard back i told he could deleted

i told he could deleted you want i haven't checked today it's if you believe it or not

and then carmen i realized that when i had copied all of her to x. a. i had copied there that was kind hammock data and

so had to redo that one and just copy over the static data and so

and so i need to get with her now and delete the old off the desk and then i

the desk and then i would have done you know the or i have to meet with

so but year figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you're clearing up from the broadcast news

but we have some other disk some of which are using for but

so we have space on the current disc right now where meeting recorder is and that's probably

and that has enough room for about four meetings right now i mean

so should one question i have for you was we need probably should move the or and all that other off of may be recorded desk is there

right like do you that's probably the best thing to do and that way we consolidate meeting recorder onto one disc rather than spreading them out

like do you know what happened with this guy than spreading them out no

i often i mean i can tell you i just don't know off the top of my head

bitty useful because they're the jewish and i'm glad to hear that here

i but for me is he's interesting because they're and it they use it in the station a little bit about the person

person it up they're going grenade thrown in because you cough overlapping films

up to me hey by a woman i cough and it and i think the time mark or they'll drop sewn in we can because we wheat it

because we wheat it's not mark

that by hand and i see that like company that it but but like by cutting back on because they'd pay at white

like company cutting back on because

i used to that they go i don't know too it they don't know you see with people she won't because they and having that enough time to walk on these and among i you know about two

so are you planning to do that or have you done that already and did the door on

have you done that or are you planning to do that of like you

to do that you know i done is that

that but they use it affordable week

i need to truly sentence

i should get the digital camera

these will be assigned by i mean it took us you would the dropping speech droppings a speech that's it

these will be assigned by hand that's it

any truth he says was just starting and for needs

one or two or more he's true free but like by the moment job only this is on it and then in the top includes people speaking at the same time or a speaker and a brass overlapping someone else's breath or clicking overlapping with speech so that's all those possibilities in the top one

one or two or more people speaking at the same time

or two or more true free at the same time or a speaker and

don't it's just the city is all about the speech phone did defend it's because it need to be

because it is but i think she saying where are you in these three categories wordy you put be instances in which there was one person speaking and other sounds which are not speech

which category do you put that the question

yet i put the speech prone day from day watch speaker without say hey any even smaller right

even smaller right so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a non speech event at the same time

what do they that's out by a woman which category like

out by a woman no

so yes that's everything before so that's the for i don't know but because i they wanted me to they and that the study you not marked got it fine so you know it's not in that

yes that's everything before for i don't know you not marked you know it's not in that

yes that's everything before for i don't know you not marked you know it's not in that

it unless there's speech speechless speech

the reason because it's just so sad

sad no it's perfectly sensible way to go we just wondered trying to

we just wondered trying to understand what you're doing because you talk about

you're doing because you talk about other overlapping events in the past so

or the information you mentioned about two it and i don't think we're asking for that you're just trying we

is about two it and did this the having to sit i don't know what topped we was they would that would just yet you're just trying to understand we just wanted to know what the category was here

or something pure sound no he's pure something

you think one percent you

right because you're calling what you're calling event is somebody coughing or clicking or wrestling paper or hitting something would turn pulse of noises

which can be included in right

it if you that i think i seen it that to sometime themselves and they said that to build on what's his poop convenient that's it that's going to but by tight before it's like a signal noise situation

by tight before like you said it's it's to decide and we said he said just kind right it's it means background might be i see

right it's it means background might be better words and silences just sort

i'm it i'm going to people are it this the bed one it acceptable features just customer and molds

tone or whatever

son so because i to be just have to

it and i got to a your family

to a your family suggestion also so if it beach checker if they're on it's not it's time for any of and

it i couldn't come in with just a dinning name of sales so because

sales so because i like i said i the say and like dirty it towards thrown if it's too long i know for me anymore it's on kimberly chat on the phone and i want to bartman and

thrown if it's too long i know

but you know the future it might be so he went on

this is that they used to boom it post thing it for simpler it before it defend their when i be number also if he a simpler and it twenty five is seventies the t. v. but i mean to it before for each one

you know if that's stepped name's the research and maybe it's tied to a to prove what he's about four months what's the difference but i mean took it too but she fight the defendants and put is it is that some of approach took because to fight it did defensive things off each address it what these and and what does it now or

prove what he's about four months what's

if they if essay you know

essay you know i'm he's type it to use some a. b. s. she made up to that you have these command obvious

classify fire and it that because if i was making minimum and he say it's it seem it up and that sixty five use it it being quantify but the pretty up onto fights if it's your stool toy is son be stuns to put it but still if eighteen teeny cost

know modal so is it just one cluster per we would i'm always

i know that post refused to use and you know what and it'll and new and it's

i was supporting i. c. team in he said you would you stay there and what he's when

it's hard to what you it's hard to tell under your own religious what's going on internally

but it's actually not that hard to analyze it and figure out the effects of different inputs especially if they're all normalized

right i too much case any reasonable crossfire is going to be a mess and it's going to be hard to figure out what

us so i wouldn't to that it is deficient that they do what i mean i think the other thing i want

that i think will give you a lot of inside of what is likely to be useful feature when you put it to a more complicated crossfire the second

it strikes

it strikes me that there's another piece of information that might be usefulness simply the transition so

because it would be to probably get stuck

it would be to probably get stuck to it at the session deck with the cape bobtail dipper get it i've seen you it saw fit it tramane pay what you teeth

i'm i used to use it for a simpler and they run it's

enjoy it and toughest thing it you know fast is that we see put a simpler be kate continuing compare ma

he's he doesn't but i think in any event we that the first step is

jeeze so again i think the first thing to do to detect it overlaps just to look at these in

in again the things you've written up there i think are way too big

about say tall order have cc's or something like that's way too much you want to look

much you want to look at you'd be

at you'd be able to do is put into a crossfire and see how does whereas

you read enough i think if you have things if you pick one or two dimensional things or three if you ever fancy display and look at how the different classes separate themselves out to have much more insight about what's going on

very and it would be studying nipping at such moments i would i he would paint poo we'd say if what i speech they make what i said just peachy the speech it they make such the speech what

right d. a. the speech five is it would be you d. c. caller i it's messier

but i think that would be an interesting result five it what i mean what did they say it's they real incitement to police the ratio and we i think i think it's not a it's

but i think that would be an interesting result five it what i mean what did

i hate they seemed it then and is it i'm at the we found into it and walk we've both and it speech five bucks it

are probably better when did you go to see the i suppose that i that would put to that they know you it that's another reason why very simple features things like energy and things like carmen this day and residual energy are are better use and very complex ones because more reliable chuck was

but that's no you're you're right that in fact if

that in fact if we made use of the fact they're two microphones you do have some location information but we don't have with the one and

can do with one because and it's not necessarily true that every device that you're trying to is with will have two

if on the other hand we show that there's a huge advantage was too then that could be a real point

a good thing to consider there's a complication on that is a person turn their back to be to the p. d. ate them some of the position on summation goes away

it but you can put on a little turntable you in this last time that if you're straight down the mid line then they left rights can be friends and in his case

but you can put on a little turntable you in this last time that if you're straight down the mid line

it you can put on a little turntable that if you're straight down the mid line then they left rights can be friends

i don't i source of information i the top potter apology of it is a

me i get they seem because it and at least i'm beaten into those the two michael's and microphoning p. d. lenient but if

p. d. it's timing difference i you

so i mean i know it's very important too i'm just i'm

but i don't think that matters though that's perspective

though that's so silly i think the issue is there a clean signal coming from only one direction

if it's not coming from just one direction if it if there's a broader pattern it means it's more likely to multiple people speak

so sort of like how confused is it about where the demons they are is it a is it is there an arrow is there a narrow

is it about where the demons is it is there an arrow is there a narrow beam pattern or is it distributed being that

with him but i mean but the thing is just having to might if you look at that thing on day and age it was when there two people seeking it looked really different

so when one person speaking then wherever they happen to be at the point of the sneaking then there's a pretty big maximum

the lag so whatever angle you are

talking it wouldn't work right i there we go down the same what i'm asking versus you

if like if people were saying seems like that would be pretty strong

right across from each other you couldn't tell the difference either crossing it the same axis you don't have as much differentiate so much

right we did we don't have a third dimension there so it's differentiate so much i was just this is going to be there for actually different really very valuable

but it's almost i mean that's not to say i mean i certainly think it's extremely bad we humans depend on you know these aren't all cute but

so that the one where someone is just right directly in line sort of pathological or someone yes

what you got to what about just but he had put a third in you could put in the other access and then you know any sort of and they pretty much cover

it would be more interesting to study the p. c. n. because they stipulation vacation seem

that's what i that's not do whatever we want or but the thing is one at least one of the things i was hoping to get it was is what can we do we what we think would be the normal situations and people get together and one of them has

what are the constraints right that's

they have pennsylvania big micro room the race it some people that at it brown and that and it cape

they have pennsylvania and it

very finely on the wall and you know if you can do that you've got microns all over the place

could you know noisy room they could have all kinds of noises and they had very precision

on somebody it was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual and listen to it compressed so pretty much

was it was interesting but the reason why haven't

know what you need and you can't just always go let's go to this heavily instrument room and we spent ten thousand dollars this to set up

i mean not only can you microphone race but you can do all sorts of multi band as so it's it would be

so we may want to have everyone sign before i had to make one

doing but if we're in a hurry we can put that

we still have to do this next week and i would like to present the results i have a meal

take that i just to them and then and then and

then we i would prefer to have more time for my results because i do

results because i do that next week maybe

according those we won't be able to change if someone says

no because then that would give you a mapping and you don't want to have a map so first decision as we're going in

and you don't want to have a map no because that would give so first decision as we're going in on them eyes the same name for the speaker down a fire and also in the text whenever the speaker's name is mentioned

because that would give you a mapping between the speakers real name and attack were using and we don't want i don't think you understood what i said so

protection on the other hand this is a small pool and people who say things about topic x. e. who are researchers and known in the field they'll be done a viable it simply from the from person however

from person however taking one step further back they did in the bible anyway even if we changed all the names so

now in terms of like so i did some results are so report on next time which i do mention individual speakers by name now

by name now they're the human subject to me is very precise

you can you know the for instance exactly doesn't matter

i mean i doesn't i mean i'm not knowledgeable about this certainly doesn't matter the same

knowledgeable about this certainly does bother me to have someone first name in the transcript the same thing so

i mean for going to step in after the fact and change people's names and transferred we've done something wants to worse

i was sick i don't want to change the name in the transcript but that's because i'm focus leaving

me so if i'm saying how do you mean what they're talking about

they can't do that the current ones they don't do speaker identity i mean i

they can't do that the current ones they don't do speaker identity because i mean i

you should just teaching you chain you take was that

once because like that but i'm betting they'll be huge variations in the accuracy of their labeling speakers will have to review the transcript

to the next time it'll be speaker three even if it's actually speaker one that would be

we you really good on their part and but then we would need to label it that's

good point which what do you do for discourse tracking for work because you don't know to know and you need to know what can cookies they hadn't identification of the you know just because you want to be to want to know

for work who sticks you don't but for discourse you do to know hopefully you do

if someone says what is jose doing and then jose says something you need to know that was jose responding
