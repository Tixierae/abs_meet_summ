i think it could be here next week
here next week westie through friday through
not time as far as i know so
so by bit and see how much of a difference it makes
how about for the mismatched or the or the medium mismatch conditions have
and we might just not even be in the right operating range so
it's me actually even if you want to be played on the games should side of can be kind of tricky so
dennis g.
but let me ask you this what's
you never coliseum search and swear or higher with s. g.
so if it's very different then this is the sort of thing i really got address
be like he'll be around for three days

of like some probabilities together you can take seventh retarded or something or smog i mean
if you're operating in the wrong range and that's why just in general if you change what these penalties and scaling factors are you reach some point that's that's the minimum so
we're doing and as you say as you point out finding ways to then compensate for that and friend and also then becomes priority for this particular test
done it
we try too you was they inviting it's they if they put in between day except they expect on message that ben it's been two
didn't we just got to work on one week just people no more
you may really want to add other things later anyway because you
really like to have something that needed no particular noise at all maybe just some
all maybe just some white noise or something like that at most
the mean can't really do vocal track normalization but something
so whatever it was it would have to be sort of preferring basis
but still it's not going to probably radically changed the scale of things

so other than reading that it's hard there
i mean it didn't make a whole lot of difference like for the matched case
the performance another it's that even though it sounds pretty dumb just applying the same number of states to everything or alas no matter what language isn't so bad
so i mean the searching is a symptom
our numbers into we should probably take it based on the range we get into matched k.
so there's nothing you
male female it's good to know also
if that really help because you already have you know females and

that means turns around one
and doug props and
so they're kind of like why probably of and those and those that's
of and those that's what goes into h. t. k.
just going to it things are going to scale it you
doing that it's probably pretty close to a to be causing transformation but still it's
and it maybe at the very least it may be quite different from a it is for no kept repeal p.
the first thing that look at without testing anything would just to go back to experiment look at thee associations assertions and relations

is adjusting the of the scaling and assertion healthy sort of
and then when they finally actually evaluated things they used everything
and it is true that the performance on the german was i mean
it's true maybe there's parameters other people have used you know that
be easy to see but if you're supposedly just using a six pack and then you just coming up with a feature actor i'm not
it's and speak to garden
but you know some problems or hurting this

and but anybody using the system what
that in fact it might have been part of what the difference was you he's
so my suggestion though is that you know necessarily finished that
that you put it all together so that it's you've got a clear structure to it you know what
things are you have things documented you've
italian in the finish we're development
i don't know i was just wonder if there was other information we could exploit

so by our friend and i mean take you know the virtues to take some version that and has that is you know our current best version of something
what's a typical number
so that's a move tutors fifty hertz whereas the third
whereas the third format which might start off at twenty five hundred hurts you know might be up to thirty seven fifty s. is that
or something you know it's more like looking at third form and over overturned or something like that
my point was more that it's work sometimes and
but sometimes it doesn't work so

but my suggestion is that at least for this meeting people should go ahead
you're talking about for for our future
it's difficult to say what it's going to get because
it's going to get because when we look at the or k. digits experiments that's three conditions that they're different noises in
o. j. that need that
in spanish how much you could adjust things

looking at the i wrote down with the deletion institutions and surgeons or
four different numbers of states per phone
and that was when people were saying that we should have a bush activity detector
that because all that that we're getting through the silence it's getting through is causing search and so
there's something simple in mind looking for things on my fish no i haven't
i mean you could maybe use the idea is a similar idea to what they do in boca like normalization you know you

we do have to do over a range different conditions some which are noisier
went all you could do is just a justice of the back and was once one knob and
it's always mainly working in europe
forcing thing voicing detect
and say look this is not generalizing i
in terms of gender

on maybe working on what
you discovering anything it makes you scratch your head as you write this report like why did we do
it's true except models doing signal processing so
but something that had some of that in fact
they should always looking searching solutions and subscription so
there is kind of specter fattening after a few times

sunday and
even though it's it's true that in a real situation you can't in fact adjust the these scaling factors in the back and it's our artificial here that we're not that just he knows you certainly don't want to be adjusting house all the time if you have a friend
i know how this no rhythm
there's also the inspectors subtraction
and so i think it's important three jewish music i know asian is just increases our house doing sentence portions

i'm you've already looked at this in these noisy
i mean it in the dual systems we used to do i i remember numbers kind of like assertions being half the number of relations is being and both numbers being tend to be on the small side comparing to substation
to substation
this the whole problem with insurgents was what i think we talked about when the guy from o. j. i came down at one time and that
what kind of information you mean i was

you know they don't have any check accent not time
bit what happens is when you get to the noisy you start getting lots of infections
what a good idea be to try to map it into the same range you get in a matched case sophie computer with
you don't want to change it for different condition ranges

because the one thing that the one thing it seems to me we really should try if you hadn't tried before worries had occurred it was sort of obvious
it was sort of obvious thing
so four
but it wouldn't surprise me if there's still

so the next
you when you just that those numbers from l. caps from did it
were seeing you never seen yes our system is so much better than the tandem system
it whatever the kill tease doing that it's probably

i don't remember off the top of my head
so when i was doing i just wrote down some numbers for the matched case
part of
no not that she training their own networks now

get someone else to do it you can supervise or something but
i just need to get friend and for me where you put me to some files
where you put me to some files that you've already talked
you can't look at a whole lot of ernst and do anything you can't write

i know the v. a. d. takes care part of that but i've seen that with the male
cats from i don't know about over our front and but
i'm it's more balanced
i'm it's more balanced but it

and we would really justin again even
pretty valuation you get an extra point or something if you took a little bit but
but we experiments and trying to pull it together in some coherent for them to be able to see what happens i
but we raced experimenting i mean we see what happens i

you don't want to change it for different condition sophie computer with the range was in matched and then when we get our noisy conditions that would try to make it have the same ranges
so we have to at least i think determine that's not true
that's all that any anything new on the thing that you're working on with be
i hope i would hope they would

otherwise i mean what ranger we can
is this a report
so i think it's good to pause and together everything together and make it's in good shape so that other
at least just mess female

adjust that and then continuous this what we're doing and
in europe
but that's not really what this contest is so
but it's that in future so

i think it's something we have to try anyway
adding a from the stage like
of it's probably something that experiment designers didn't really think about because
especially if you talk with and when i'm not here that's the

security number
it really it just something that popped into my head just now and so
or should shouldn't be there should be less so
anyway because if the law problems that are coming out of the atmosphere really big the standard assertion penalty's going to have very little effect

through sunday and
much case we want to adjust that and
good and it generates they should always looking

so i've tried playing around a little bit with in searching penalties and things like that
because the the we saw them
it's interesting thought maybe having something

but they raised a very
right in searching numbers very high
you could imagine that they're just

so the next question to ask which is i think the one that and dresses to addressing himself too and a lunch meeting is we're not supposed to adjust the back and but
he picked right
into one that so it's is it balanced in terms of gender

if you were just adjusting the back and how much better would you do in no ice
because the language scaling in searching thomas over there probably set to be about right for mel capture
part of be that sri system they always adjust these things about of optimize is there

i didn't even write them down
i don't remember i would need
they use some process and you've got in database to train divisive kiki's picked right

the most obvious thing is just the assertions but
of can be kind of tricky so i mean what you would do is set the scaling factor is so that you got the best number for this point four or five times the downside
but they might change that those ratings

house all the time if you have a friend
i remember after we got our more or less together and he pretty systems are built that weekend it to set the scaling factors it kind of a standard level and we would really
to scale it you know subtracting from summit scale it from it but

it's of these other things and they turn out that it's kind of reasonable but then
things documented you've look things up that you needed to look up so
to look up so that you know so there's such a thing could be written and

and they german and danish worthy valuation day
almost then they actually
they are normalized after that and

being applied to the data in some way
i don't see how you could possibly do you can't look at a whole lot of
it doesn't work for just having one frame or something you

do you think that would be the case for next week also or is
yes i wonder if there's anything that we could do to the front and that would affect insurrection

i did play with that actually a little bit
but let me ask you this what

but they raised a very valid point
but i think we may get a better handle on that if we see

so forth and then tweaked out a little bit and see how
somebody at the stadium and done that go into it and then

but you know four summers and he's a good one you know
how much this is improved if you actually just that

but it is interesting say you have four the noisy
i think it's much more about and so it's when something is more robust

so if you have something that has a much smaller range are much larger range and taking the appropriate grouped
the rules as i understand it is that in principle the italian and spanish and english italian

range and taking the appropriate
you know if something is kind of like the equivalent of a bunch of probabilities multiplied together you can take a route of some sort of like some probabilities

or smog i mean throughout the seven but
noises in if it's just to perform as on scene noises into that scene send on the scene

i mean it's more directly like the that the language scaling or the the miles going acoustic scaling but you that's interesting
scaling but you know that those things have kind of a somewhere effectiveness or should penalty anyway it's slightly

anyway it's slightly different way of handling it so
i think so if we know what the searching penalty is weak about what range are number should be and so that they

but i've seen that with the male cats from i don't know about
could look into dish

it's a symptom that there's something wrong with a range but there's
listen to yourself i mean that's really doesn't sound like a real time thing with less than two hundred millisecond is latency is that and where you're not adjusting the statistical engine at all setting that's true

i was sufficient changes for different conditions i was just saying
conditions i was just saying that when we pick a range we want to pick a range that we map our numbers into we

and he's probably not going to be anyone who's going to say this the future of you know
people within this tight knit community who are doing this evaluation are accepting more or less that these are the rules

what's the old with you that has developed over the last week it
then they are much worse

because you know you're going to have another bunch of results sit in there anyway and
much better it's

and right now it's kind of important that we actually go forward with experiment so
and then just add some kind of a minor my fish and

is margot
so i ended our small things we've talked you discovering

can't hear or something but that there partially result but just look at
so the question is you know whatever they are at that point i they something for which taking square ruder keepers or four three or something like that is going to be a good or a bad thing

we have extracted the noise from speech that car
they can train you on the tour speech and he's

drives me was
drives me was it was actually different cars and so on so

no to build models on day
it probably would be the case that if say we trained on italian data and then we tested on danish dead and it did terribly that's that you would look bad in i

check it's do we know anything about the speakers for each of the training entrances
what do you mean we do you have speaker

mean we to be social do you have speaker information
mean we to be social do you have speaker information

you mean i was thinking about things like you know gender you know genders specific gnats and vocal tackling normalization
i don't i didn't know what information we have about the speakers that we could try to take it on

fairly quickly can do male female or male female but
as far as i mean like i thought b. n. did this thing with vocal truck normalization ways back maybe

although you are going to get less distinct higher is still third form it's kind of a reasonable compromising
so i think if i recall correctly they did something like that and

there's something perhaps they could spend some days that i kept this thing
it seems that when retrain that's awesome it seemed to payment him and she chose the they look as good as the trucks train the

and so maybe they are much more sensitive to different recording conditions or shouldn't be
national taxes so

i really got address brought this point
i sort of forgotten to discuss it

and you might want to change
then followed by other kind of processing it's not dependent on that hit speech on science

it doesn't tell you what the variance of
and sometimes you know there's enough evidence or something working and it's harder

knowing with the some of the probabilities are doesn't tell you what a someone longer
they're sort of the green nominee area values

i won't be here thursday and friday but my suggestion

i seen a here and

been working on getting recorders

what's your projection

like for the matched case it seemed like it was pretty good

i could do more playing with that though

but you were looking at no cancer

right so i mean it's not the direction that you are working with they we were saying what's what's the best you can do with no catch them but

which i so the first

so the first order i mean you have other things you're going to do

but the first order i would say that the conclusion is that if you do some munching around with the exact h. t. k. train and was you know how many states and so forth it doesn't particularly improve the performance another

and i she hadn't gotten to experience you want to do it never doubt seems but

let's just if we had to draw a conclusion on information have far we'd say something like that right

they're probably not at all set right for these things particularly these things that

particularly these things that look over larger time windows in one way or another with al t. a. k. o. t. and their own that's all these things and the fat

and the fat pass we always found we had to increasing talon assertion penalty to correspond such things

i think that's that's kind of a first order thing that we should try so

so the experiment is to run our friend and like normal with the default and certain penalties and so forth and

i mean don't want to do this over a hundred different things that they've tried but you know

to i did write down

but that's all i wrote down

i can do that for next week

also sometimes if you run behind in some of these things maybe we can get someone else to do it you

but i think it'd be good to know that

probably will have time to do that and time to play a little bit with the silence so maybe

so maybe i can have that for next week in phoenix

you he's part of that we were seeing

part of what's going on is the the rain

that has a similar effect

because it changes the scale of the numbers of the differences between different candidate's from the acoustic model as right

opposed to what's coming from the language model so that right so in effect that's

from the language model i mean it's so in effect that's changing the value of your assertion penalty

i think so so that's be and so that they match with

why i think that's another reason other in curiosity as to why we would in fact be kind of neat to find out if we're way off

any other things are we seeing you i'm you've already looked at

this in these noisy cases are we are seeing lots of insurgence right in searching

and it may be i betcha there's still a lot

and it may be less of a critical thing i mean the

thing i mean the fact that some get by maybe less of a critical thing if you get things in the right range so i mean the searching

but there's your substation tend to go up as so

some which are noisier than others

it's if we actually could pick a more stable value for the range of these teachers it's

if you have a friend and it's in roughly right range

once we knew what russ roughly red operating range was pretty stable and

it depends to map everything into

it depends how much we want to two games bishop and how much we want to do into

i just sort of think we need to explore the space

is take a look at the we i mean

i mean and grass gave very reasonable response and he's

but people outside of it is looking at the broader picture certainly going to say a minute you doing all this standing on your head in the friend went all you could do is

or determine that it is true much case we want to

what's all to do developed

on the report to work it was on what

thing voicing detect

to try to phone always seek test for that b. can be team voice on place

bush so they another part of me that they dates we they of to clinician flinch so

s and energy give audience help push up that the clinician you

so that's that's what you're describing a week or two ago so

but they don't cover this we don't publicize to stay of it go to that need to

need to shine in that one

we saw them they just but sunday as

as they do to go can go the needed to do to be someway joke to

it if i can summarize what's going on is that you're going over a lot of material that you generated in furious fashion tutoring

tutoring many results doing experiments and trying to pull

i mean we just like some kind of taking care of report

is this a report that's for or or is

dixie or or is it just like a tech report for dixie

sister and i first of july

and that you think you're on actually finishing it in june

so that other people can get access to it and so that can

to it and so that can go into a report in june but i think

but i think to really work on fine tuning the report at this point is probably bad timing

i got a ring all that for some conditions could get and everything

at some point they did that for the he picked right

i it's a matter of interpretation the rules

in spanish how much you could adjust things

was i mean it improvement wasn't so good to perdue bra performance was really pretty good

it doesn't appear that there's strong evidence is even though things were somewhat too and on those three or four languages that's going to a different language really her you and

her you and the noises were not exactly the same right

because it was taken from a different

i mean were different drives me was

it's somewhat too and it's and

that's something i'd like to understand before we actually use something from it because he gets

really think about because i think most people aren't doing train systems or you know systems that are like cars where you actually use the data to build models

it's true except that that's what we used to never or one so

and then they design the things for our two knowing that we were doing that's true

and they didn't forbid us right

would look bad in i think someone would notice and say look

i hope i would hope they would

you know that they have tuned in some way for other things so it's

maybe just a topic

and when i'm not here that's the topic you should discuss with meaning

with meaning check it's do we know anything about the speakers

made female bank ten

i mean again if you had the whole system youre optimize and that would be easy to see but

i mean having the two that's suppose you detected that was male celia with different you could put them both in

with different you could put them both in a separate streams or something

maybe having something along the mean can't really

looking for things on my fish no i haven't thought it was thought too much about it really it just

head just now and so

normalization you know you have some sort of a general speech model and maybe just

and maybe just a mixture of calcium that you evaluate every other ends against and then you see

and then you see where each you know other ends like the likelihood of each other and she divide the range of the likelihood up into discrete bins and then each pins

but just listen to yourself i mean that's really doesn't sound and then each pins got some knob setting

but just listen to yourself i mean setting

not not just expensive

each frame comes in it's got to go out together and so right

ways back maybe other people do too with

other people do too with the trying to a third format average informant using that as an indicator of

you know third foreman if you imagine

if you imagine that the first order what happens with changing focal track is that the foreman skit moved out by some proportion

so if you had a first format that was one hundred hertz before is this fifty if they vocal track this fifty percent shorter then it would be out at seven fifty years

so but on the other hand male female is is a much simpler categories patient and figuring out a factor too squish or expanding the spectrum so

imagine that they're just like we're saying voice on voiced is good to know

you have to figure out a way to incorporated on the fly

i mean i as you say one thing you could do is simply have the male and female opted sectors you know to nets train only emails and know on and females or

i don't know if that really help because you

you know females and it's pretty into one that so it's is

when they are used in the speech that kind of dictates that occasionally

m. s. g. is very may appeal p. is very

may appeal p. is very much like no custom

she is very different from us

you always have to look at how this these justice affect things

and even though we're not allowed to do that again we maybe could reflect that back to are use of the teachers

so if it if in fact the problem

the problem might be that the range of industry features it's quite different than the range guilty or not catch

we have estimation was mysterious we be in attendance ginny put something like that

but it it doesn't necessarily you know they could

is you taking log these things that could be

so we should look into like

or what you know what you're saying you're actually looking at

the values that are actually being fed into u. c. k.

and so the the tendon system the values that come out of the net don't go through the signal i'd right

and that's something that nothing

that nothing else after that just going to it things are going

scale it from it but nothing will have that same fact

again you don't compared to smaller setup lung problems

again you don't really look at that it's something that's lung problems

it's something that's and then it's gone

and then it's gone through this transformation that's probably pretty close to it whatever the kill tease

maybe entirely off and

if there's a fairly large effect of the difference say do the ratio between surgeons relations for the two cases and that would be indicators like in that direction

carson cage it's and speak

and it's harder breaks in so

breaks in so but

but it could be that when you say it works maybe we could be doing much better it's

i think maybe you should try to integrate it and

i think that's the team falls too use a big key are you a big bunch of the system of ericsson

yes the trust attraction

this is mean initially was also take almost everything from the this proposal

it's a bsing coming for discussion with him next week

it took a lot of time just getting my taxes other way national taxes

i'm starting to write code now for my work but i don't have any results

but i don't have any results yet

on it would be good for me to talk to he neck i think when he's here
