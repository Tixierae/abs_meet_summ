seminar but that at the shore court case
like trying to do something different like taking it what do you think it takes that takes past
this is the different but
the different but i would i will send him an email and tell him exactly what they are going
in the rest two it aren't because he's
frequency which the most important speech
so that would be reduction
three hundred and thirty the whole system
but there are other points of chili
which would perhaps at some more today is
like to dump something which has to be dropping frames
was about and people have longer latency though
that straightforward so we it would this is a test that largely had as of noise and we did we
and we did we ever did nothing explicitly to handle it's always
so forth how long was it from when somebody finished another instead when something started
what is the advantage of that
it's that but for the moment of something that the screaming and you they are
and the other sitting out but it's not just it so but it's
when the speech that when dissing other studies more important compacted snow it's at home the christians more on one
but when the part that those senior of obvious small compared to noise and so the christian just more important
so you have a mixture too graphic i
a variant that after just determining signal to noise ratio is to just you can do it a neutered of saying mike thing to determine means only i
kind of a problem i mean imagine if i purchase the middle of the speech population spectrum right samantha
to do but i just think that for real noises with what's most likely to happen is that they'll be some things are relatively stationary where you can use one or
where you can use one or another spurts subtraction thing and other things
summary of what you're
but so there no girl units
and was played around with this in a different kind of way a little bit but better smackdown
didn't they also do some kind of an oracle experiment
what could be those enough to take terms i mean or other kind of features
in addition to detect taking something wrong
that's what she wanted to go far also

they were more or less treating competition for performance and we were
think the best systems so
don't think there's any good reason for it in the application actually i mean you're
good deal these are large vocabulary thinks of the decoder
thinks of the decoder should take a really long time
and there's also this there night and
and that any manufacturer would put a bunch of effort and having some kind of good speech analyses action
we could probably get a really good estimate of the noise if we just went to the noise files
where we've been taking sub and teachers in training up these new and that's and on phonetic targets and then combining
it's but with the exception of the stops i it's pretty much the same as wasting at least right so
if you knew you were doing that if you're doing something say
other so that's that girls build other detectors on different phonetic teachers

this was the talk where they were supposed to try to decide
so that would be reduction of a hundred and thirty six millisecond
it would probably feel different but
so you get a decent hissed a gram of these energies takes at least a few seconds
you know it's that's tricky do has mistakes
do has mistakes and
for example he present a detector to detects honor it's
so that by the way is a is one of the units in our in our own networks that's all it's that one and
a number of properties that i really liked i mean
but the one the good questions from the audience was but that wasn't trained for that i mean
didn't they and says that perhaps even you know trying to use them the best way we can't that we ordinarily do with you know gutsy mixtures dress and so forth you don't actually do that in determining whether something is honored or not which means

there is why when remarkable these injuries that they don't have sorting our phase
and we were trading latency performance and they were dealing
and they were dealing with noise explicitly and we were in
a brain damage system which is something actually we've done a lot over the last fifteen years
then the microscope and start moving or something
and here is tracking in that in i power domain
there's this i this is mysterious pay people to do this
i think when the paper a show that actually they commission of the now he's gay rights
you know you have to centered window
didn't they also do or not which means you're going to make errors between similar sounds that are so center drops

to decide what to do it
but it's not get past so we have this business just
and i don't think anybody's going to notice the difference between a quarter of a second latency and thirty millisecond of latency
we had a silence detector so
we would look for the end of another it's based on the silence detector
and that's when you start
we did the back trace at that point
techniques so if you're driving along in the car i would think that most of the time the nature of the noise is kind of change relatively slowly it's
and so in that sense it was not fair test

are we talking about today
which there's some discussion
clearly the way that we're operating this other does involve some like see to get rid of most of that you get down to forty
get down to forty fifty miles second street after what's the word
a quarter second person processing to clean it up doesn't seem like it's good deal these
so that's just one detector
they can imagine building many of these detectors on different features you get enough

response ordered over currency downs in
and high frequency pens internet something like you have in many sitcoms compared to that one friend many with i are girls
aren't because he's almost being out
and so so today i gave you here it's computed life much magician frequency which
people and they strike shoulders and say works
especially in noise

you know past but he thought this what supposedly my parents
that would be another center which would at ten minutes it comes again
and when we did you contractually hasn't you know fifty five minutes it comes so
to so i think of it is complimentary
no it's pretty quick so
so it's for everything else i mean if you look

six sixty five this stand is fourth don't sampling is
so but it's sitting out the information
like anyone he wants to spreadsheets to replace it with something that's this coming on in thing or
and then given those pounder then everybody the recognition you too
works so
but i'm looking into extending the work done by larry all

we just you know up systems to be more discriminate
and we did this ross to like filtering which
to like filtering which son-in-law domain and
new g. m. figure out what it is so
but just determine the means only don't worry about
they're taking sub and features and training up by detector that detects for these fanatics teachers for example

i mean you're you're speaking to recognize here in a remote server
what i'm asking a question you may start answering before i mean and done so
this there night and there's also this multi frame
we've always had usually we use this a metric does but i don't we've but
i thought i remember hearing about an experiment like that
would that's you're right that's exactly the question a follow up discussions

no he's told me anything
you don't just track the estimate of the spectrum each track
be some gas
you said they estimate of the night that's all
so it's friends the covenant hit the purpose

if you want to be very corrected so if
i they argue about that yesterday and i'm don't
i mean there's this you don't just track
so do you is there some long windows it extends into the past over which you calculate the average
just one of the concerns and the audience actually was

i mean it may feel different than talking to a person because when we
but i don't we've but we played a little bit with vision metric you can do
let's separate that
no i understand it's better to do but i just think that
this particular futurama look at this frequency or what

they weren't looking him much
so the scares you at the sickness and what the noise and or g. is in that band in the spectrum and then you look
i mean you time and i fish are that i think that
seats on each side band you have several independent tests to
tests to test whether there's the existence assignments in a sub and

just look in the past i it
what if you have a good estimation of the noise and
like after work that's hard but that's hard
features you get enough of these detectors together then you have enough information to do higher level discrimination for example of discriminating
for example of discriminating between phones and

done over the pentagon has sixty four minutes it comes of today and high
like free keeshonden abrupt
abrupt closure
it's a half dozen like that are

was annoys me did we actually did nothing
i that was my question you just i mean if you just if
they have to have targets so
targets so targets come from

so you had a quarter second delay before plus some little processing
gas
i could eat if i wonder how they did
using the local characteristics and time is probably going to work pretty but

i mean it just it feels so quick
but the other part of your as suspects attraction so
is the estimate of the noise spectrum a running estimate
slowly it's not going to stay up with the same if you if

feel different but i don't think it would feel slow
we could cut we know as we could cut down on their own that
playing around a little bit going more to
going more to the past or something

you can't do with smaller amount but it's pretty rare
and in fact i think the newest standard method of determining signal noise ratio is based on that
it's based on this kind of massive sister gram acid
sister gram acid t. v. history

that's a special structural how practically speaking if it varies
if it varies a lot to get a if to get a good estimate you need a few seconds speech you have centered
where his windows centered around
but i don't know if you know it certainly modular apple juice modulator noises is sort of a big problem in practice i think

i'm i know now i know what you're talking about no he's come
and i can't remember now the top of my head how many frames of silence we had a detective for would declare it to be the end of an utter and
i mean depending on where the window was that you use to calculate signal ratio

regis i knew was gross
using a regular seasons intersection so
so we took the is girls the fear factor is and we the saying i r. girls that have the same frequency response

so you need to discuss with what we're doing because
out what it is so now you have this picture to gosh and she's you know
and some period and then to expect from its

be in contact more i think that the fact that we did that with had that thing with the latency is indicative of the fact that there was enough communication
so we try also to add a time sampling
in the theater

is that the way online or my education was dumb he's just using this week or something and features stream
very slow it's very useful you didn't you know stationery
they're probably looking in on speech sections and getting some

it would get six sixty five
at the beginning you have some
they have some and getting some

i would say it was probably around the order of two hundred fifty millisecond
i mean we have an experiment this but
the low level detectors are logistic regression is

i don't think you can really tell a person
now this is coming at it from a different angles but
from a different angles but maybe it's a good way to start that these

so we was thinking tool i mean tool up tight day and expect us just to and for waiting so i'm
so i'm too to change big context i can't. full id
day and just like in t.

chain and use id disco montego
and i mean that did look like it buys you something over just to kill the
and if you've got enough time this other method appears to be some

d. c. seeking prove over ordered owned a nun discriminating ours formation
and he's been your friend that's been turned and so
you know that's a manage to see whether it having their own that really buys or anything

would you know is it p. ways that it
be book i state b. d. o.
one thing that would be no good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about proposing doing but having a third party run a good v. a. d. and determine boundaries

right samantha jack hammer going five hurts
you could get hurt a lot if you just took some something from the beginning of all the speech of you know an our speech
sense though i mean it's possible you should you should make it center the center of the window

and it keep combine by a soft and gate and then at the
a little bit but better smackdown
than that we train these things up

and so our each of these low level detectors are they
are the something that you decide ahead of time like i'm
ahead of time like i'm going to look for this particular futurama

she probably done for you done separate that are peace on the different forced alignment on
so so that may or may it that aspect of it in may or may not be helpful because in the sense that same
because in the sense that same sort of thing you're taking global information and the

that's us programs call yesterday
i mean you could do this with a recurrent that

because the women we look do yet if it draws why they are made you know past but
so you see you heather so

corrected so if you want to get commission is i mean to be what directed commissioner they mean we have to do take academy sequence in the future
this safety called you're on that and she but on this

so it could be around two hundred and four tease
posted that the frames just barely in there

what were they thinking of changing it to
how do they measure but this is i think a little more drew

they were the main ones as long latency but
other so that's that girls other detectors on different phonetic

she would take as long as it's under half a second or something i'm not
once you get that time you train the whole thing on maximum likelihood

on demand containment think we
they are but let's not have that be part of this test let's

i would you know is it p. ways that it
magnitude i mean probably power

and i'm don't know the answer we
should find out i'm will find out soon

yes people and they strike
over the whole thing and then i have a noise factor

and four or less so
and jerry did this

which is more important during assignments potions one
without tricks like this

in the spectrum and then you look over the whole thing and
it's like saying what's friends talk onto this purpose

the variance and then just use those mean values as being sing always ratio napping
it seems like this kind of thing could add to the latency

but what is what this how could tell
but but what is what this how could tell do

right a few seconds to get a decent estimate but it's changed a lot in a few seconds kind of a problem i mean
and you worked on stationary no i just like not as much as

studies that i stationery press you don't even need some kind of noises commission agreement
agreement beginning of some

they maybe maybe overtly complicated for this test but
but what you're saying you know make sense though i mean it's possible

where we're ready having problems with these delay delay issues
for that i mean disuse a very smooth stuck drama low it's something that you know has evolved as being generally a good thing for speech recognition

and they show like six or ten d. be both
what's under this pressure always used to take yes to me

these meetings yet so you're
and for every sub band it you just pick ahead of time i'm going to have like five independent logistic tests

so you're coming up with here calls proposal
they have a system that's multi band system but they're multi band

i've talked to somebody already but
if you're doing something say for you wouldn't use the same kind of features she would do something

the higher level there's day sauced four gate
what're what are some of the low level detectors that they use these are all

to train degree
say use any amount rhythm to it train up these parameters for logistic regression

i'm this is dorothy of it
danny has each of these and things

or what are they looking at
and he shows that using this method to detect connor insist very robust compared to to typical full band gushing mixture estimation of assignments

and you initialized these parameters and some way and
and use the to come up with your training targets for the low level detectors

then you keep working your way up and so you build a full recognize or so
or so that's the direction which i'm thinking about going in like

rather than just immediately going for it the typical sound it's another
another thing i like about it is that shoot this thing is going to be trained explicitly trained for product of errors rule which

sound and say we train every but this is saying
but this is saying is that's maybe what our ultimate goal is

what should we be train these intermediate things for
because we don't know that's this is a particularly good feature and there's no way

we don't really know how those should be labeled it
it could speed that you should not be paying that much attention to certain bands for certain just yourself so

forth and it didn't do nearly as especially in
unless it was on it was interesting because this is what we are actually using for speech recognition these develops

but if you knew that what you're going to do is just exxon or it's not so not it's
not so not it's is almost like forced on voice except i that the voice stops or also called lobster joints

when we talked with john a holiday that we made a list of some of the things that
so the sort of things he felt would be difficult for humanity or two reliably mark would be tons position kinds of things

don't know i he was from the conference tolkien

the money and video confidence

i would have been a good thing to signed up for this thing

i've done i've no idea

so i mean that's let's assume for right now that we're just kind of like and i had because

like and i had because even if they tell us that the rules are different we're still interested doing we're doing so

added a bit worked on trying through see what to read the books and program with that and he's

we took personally took it as the girls

so they had to fit response ordered over

currency downs in another one i forgot to dance

so we're using computers

but we still have two e. p. amount a routine that does precursors they're trying you

they're trying no you had a discussion with this email about this though

i mean that the they'll probably have before was coordination right

we just have to be in contact more i think

three what was the total we ended up with two the whole system

some more today is that somewhat other in the process of our perhaps not very what interior correct like to dump

opacity stayed at twenty five it's

and then there's the third think

that's a little bit of a problem

but what when we add up everything it's it would be all right if

don't sampling is a. t. five four online on my mission

posted that the frames but the turkey barely in there

what's the allowable

that's the change the rules

the people who have very low latency wanted to be low very are very narrow they was about and people

and the best proposal that something like thirteen or fourteen musicals efficiency you know

think of it this way but the complimentary

so everything that we did in a way was it was just adamantly insisting on going in with a brain damage system which

then they do it and then someone else that's something that straightforward so

domain and tending to handle was annoys me did

thee spectra subtraction schemes couple places did seem to do and i stopped and so

we're talking about putting some of that in the mocha still keeping some of our i think you should

of our i think you should be able to end up with a system that's been both clearly the way

no what this what was your experience when you're doing with the surgical microscopes and so forth

to get the answer course i didn't take too

no it's pretty i didn't take too

and there's the school nurse or they're so probably

and it felt so probably the motion itself

and it felt to the users that it was instantaneous i mean it's fastest

i mean it's fastest talking to a person it

talking to a person it they i don't think anybody ever complained about the delay

or something i'm not an expert

i don't remember the exactly immerse but

tell a person like a person can tell the difference between you know a quarter of a second ten a hundred millisecond

i'm not even you can tell the strain according second half a second i mean

i mean if you if you said what's the what's the shortest route to the opera

and i took half a second to get back to i mean

would be i mean maybe too abrupt might have put in

i mean it may feel different might have put in this adele

because when we talk to each other we tend to step on each other's utter and says what i'm asking a

the past or something like that i we

so the latency like that i we talked about that

so the latency from the narrow own caused by how far ahead you're looking talked about that

was it in the recurring on that's where they weren't looking ahead at all they weren't looking

an experiment this but i imagine you could predicting a label more in the past

we've done we don't some that before i think

that before i think it works

so that's what you're busy with

i'm missing that last word content k. l.

word content guilty hell k. l. t. can't she

there's just understand maybe what the difference was between how much you're getting from just putting the fans together and how much are getting of the discriminate to what

the nominee area does for you or doesn't do for you just

for you just to understand a little better i

but maybe it's his discrimination and

and maybe maybe the nominees discrimination business

attraction so it just kind of what

what stage do you do that to you doing that

containment before so just do that i the know we know we watch

before so just do that i the know we watch

containment before so just do that i the know we know we watch

we watch thinking to the before that they'd be deal

the reason for that was that if someone one per one group put into the eighteen another didn't

or one had a better v. a. d.

since that they're not doing that as being part of the task and that any

still would be perfect but i mean

yes a question of eighty but otherwise it's

but otherwise it's on of the mel felt a bank energy seconds you do

i probably power

i part of me i can't

part of me i can't remember exactly

i mean if you look at the theory it should be in the power i mean but

i mean but seen implementation some people to the ninety to me

yes people and they strike

pay people to do this a lot i helped little tricks of the trade i mean there's

it'd be tomorrow and the spectrum each track that times four or

it'd be tomorrow and that times four or

so you have this commission of the forums picked the noise

you missed tied this by a factor which depend depending on the ice

you ritual security to make you kind of noise

potions one just the and then she's without

that's i mean that's what differs from different tasks and difference circus attraction methods i mean

i mean if you have fair it's the noise is quite stationery than the smartest thing to do is use as much data as possible to estimate the noise get a much

get a much better estimates attracted

so do you but if it's airing at all which is going to be the case for almost any real situation forgetting factor or something

there's a lot of different ways of computing noise spectrum so one

so one of the things that hans inspector hersh did

was to take some period of speech and in each band tilted his degree

t. v. history gram

now if you have signaling his noise noisy have these two bumps and has to grab

but what's she could approximate is to conscience

but what's don't they overlap sometimes

so i've got controversial others use that kind of method and

kind of method and the other thing to do is which is sort of more trivial obvious is too determine your magical means that there's a speech and some period and then

don't worry about the variance and

because you don't like the future right

i could eat if you want to as a good estimation on station reno is you have to look in in the future i mean

in the future i mean if you take your window and if you're raised around this window but you can expect revenues commissions if the noise in the middle of the window not at the end so

the past i it works because the noise almost area but

what if are that i think that circus attraction is really is not going to work really for nothing noise and

doing so i think that what is what's more common is that you're going to be helped with slowly varying or stationary now

i mean good luck so

i think irish does experiment with windows to five hundred mesa comes in one second and

last five hundred went was that's about it

like not as much as they could we can motivations

thing and other things were it's not so station or

i mean you can always pick something that falls between your methods

and built it averages from them

i know i don't know if it was tried this or

everybody seems to use some kind of attitude but came but into tennessee

came but it's very but you know stationery into tennessee

very slow it's very useful you didn't you know stationery

very slow adaptations useful you didn't right

the word stationery is a very precise statistical meaning but you

meaning but you know in signal processing really what we're talking about i think it's things change slowly compared with our processing techniques so

the same if you check it out five minutes later you maybe in a different part of the row whatever

if they're going to provide a voice activity detector that will tell you the boundaries of the speech then couldn't you just go outside those boundaries and do your estimate there

so i imagine that's what they're doing right

they have some kind of threshold own and the says to me

i think i think ericsson use this kind of pressure you said they

it's like saying what's another threshold assignments talk onto this

this francetelecom do same thing

for it we've done with that

we talk about a couple other things briefly just

things briefly just things that we've been

two three can be that

but they're multi band is a little different than the way that we've been doing multi band in the past where

and then combining them some somehow down the line

at the lowest level there it's an or get on it and get

and then at the higher level for every

for every if the higher

so if this detector do text the presence of dishonor and in any of the sub bands and the detect the war gate at the top says this frame has evidences hundreds and

a six point

waited so

there's always using i'm get the targets

so you have this and gate we call in and get it's a product real thing at the out

and then he uses it and then feeding into that our

so i d. three sub and there are several measures of s. n. r. and correlation

and he said there's like twenty of these per or something

that i really liked i mean one is like going towards they're bad information for phonetic features of some sort rather than just

which is what now and going out that fletcher observed in the twenties

for people listening to their ban that's friday talk

this issue of where the targets comfort

so in our case when we betray multi band things the way we get the targets for the individual bands is that we get the fanatic the sound

or not ultimate penalty but goal is getting these sound units but

along the way how much should we

and there's no way to someone in the audience

to someone in the audience just today was asking what couldn't you have people go through a mark the individual bands and say where the where it was on rent they're not but

not but you know i think having a bunch of people listening to critical band wide texas speech right turn with i think could be possible it's ouch

could be possible it's all going to sound like sign like see more or less lot of i

it's very hard for someone to the person to make that determination

yourself so what we have been doing they're just sort of mixing it all together certainly much cruder than that we train these

i that experiment she probably done

peace on the different forced alignment on these up and labels

done that did that help all

it helps for wondered one iterations but

so iterations but anything after that

how do they measure the performance their detector he's like

he's like he's just actually looking at the confusion between son rent and then

so you can apply that to recognition if he

that to recognition if he did it's

he did a comparison too are all four all the nasty

four all the nasty old standard recognize no filter bank at the fountain nature demands and so forth and

she would do something that was sensitive to the period is and

so i think that the question was right

it was and that's not for test unless it was on it was

these develops and

where they said if we could detect dishonor it's perfectly and then show how it would improve speech recognition

the easiest thing would be to go do some voicing but that's

but that's very similar dishonor it's

way to start that these are things which john felt that he a a human annotate or would be able to reliably mark
