they're going to go around this before and do too i it's
to say the name it'll probably be bleeped out this season
this is reason i did it was because otherwise the those assess to come back the same day is really not much of a visit
but what part of town do you live in
of campus
i once funny time you take it will be bad traffic that time and day and
i once you get past the bridge and
eight eighty and it's it take us tops thirty minutes to get there
wake you up after a few minutes then
i figured maybe way down the potential goals for the meeting until we talk about what's going on so
up the but do you get vacation you see
i mean one could argue all over the place about how things really will be in ten years
that's true we don't need to worry so much maybe
the that we've been working i went in and trying to get labels file so we can train up end up in that ten it and test the difference between this and that train on ten minutes and then that trained on digits digital
and seeing if it hurts or helps
and again and just to clarify when you talk about training in that you're talking about training at the net for tandem perch and
i mean those listening to this one i have a picture either so
bewitched and
and he got him i know like i cannot stand
it's tiny young yes done
yes the current brought spanish and i'm
spanish something really
but they also include is the annoys files for us
according to you nikki could be would have to he and this november
one hundred eighty @reject@ what about north conditions hundred and fourteen h. west
that there's three tasks
type a type b. and type see and
but of course it will never go on a cheap cell
i think the computations and so much of her
and expensive cellphones except expensive hand handheld and so forth are going to have lots and
i don't rule billiards
if it's new then we have this development and learning process to go through on top of just the all the work so
there and that way you won't have the network you won't be clocking in at work for yourself and others
so it's going to take us
but it's a copy of save some is it's on the server you can put it on flash scratch because

out for if we if our major goal is to have fanatic context and you figure that there's going to be a mismatch an acoustic conditions doesn't make it much worse too sort of had another mismatch if you were
and so we give them they got all the good teachers but he's got to go creatures
so pick up the phone
so this is their image someone picks up but
time you know we can train or has so can retrain and that arranger languages and which to too dependent the to talk in english
because shirley someone who's going to say at some point so you put in the german and the finish
now what do you do when somebody has portuguese
no between between languages
there's a mapping from the sixty one phoniness intended to two fifty six dixie fifty six
and the digits phone names there's about twenty two or twenty four
how does that fifty six
with says those provisions talk funny
it so far spanish a sponge too
spanish stories
what about t. i. did i basing
final test laughter so the final test i is supposed to be german and danish right
final test laughter the final test i is supposed to be german
we can test this but the door
and do we do our training on queen donna
no we're specially huntington
if you have all these nets trained someplace then you ken their outputs and do the kill transformation and so forth and
and i even do another one brown i'm tool boost i keep talking about those like they got to h. i it i ski four too it's on day he was
point i went
backed up and second it doesn't matter if that machine disappears and you get a new machine because you just read
new machine because you just read copy slash so that's what i was
he used to be here for years and so

i live is in that corner of campus
so would it be easier those
those of you who are not you know used to this area can be very tricky to get to the airport it that you know six thirty
are you going to be a someone
no it's not spanish stories know
it if they're preparing it and
tracks we've had a lot of good experiences putting those together
didn't know that how long's it for training of the norm
i would say two days
posted on the net it depends
you could set up you know ten different jobs or something to run on spur difference spurred boards and
on the other hand almost anything that really is you know is new were saying let's look at like refine before about voice and voice silenced detection features unless it's i think it's great
it's instead of doing roster with a log you doing roster with analog like function that varies depending on it j. parameter
sudden it because they suffer along pronouns you've got but
and the thing is that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically too concurrently a different machines difference person so forth and you see how long it takes someone machine and so forth you stand back from and say if we look at all these combinations were time about combinations combination so forth probably find you can't do it
so then at that point we should sort out which ones we throw away which are the
could do a lot of i money wouldn't surprise me if we could do a hundred of them or something probably
bring it back to my that
right now they're still all time pretty much all ten negative line and we have reached
put them on another described rent a space
so i that's the other topic

but ticket for for very we're not
the future they mentioned the training that they mentioned in that the state that i mentioned
so the phone doesn't know what what your languages if it's
so that's what we're involved in might
deal that the biggest deal is the you know our acoustic environment mismatch and they may very
i mean why map to sixty one to fifty six
deep south if it's not really from the u. s. either
it's not seen
they're just trying to be difficult
crazy i mean these are a lot are built in things we know
see you do have to compute the kale transformation
teach coming and what
it's hard to take credit used to kate it's their own
right so i mean they need that i mean but
and the benefits of say you run a spur and then you can do other things on your computer
and you just saying let's look at the outer product of all these things
for the for it meant strain on digits we have been using four hundred order in units
despite his name and you're saying about these spanish
so anything that you don't need backed up we can put on this new did
that i actually start out this field trip start off with talking phoenix so you mean you
which could be important and if one thing

trip next week number springfield trip to gee i
we're not saying overnight we don't need
i'll give you my phone number and
but your initial things you're making one choice there which is
we're the digits hand labeled for
are they those labels automatically the digits
are they those labels automatically or the digits those
ascribe what's on the cube i mean
and i'm not french
to ride from t. i. digits they
they corrupted it would different kinds of noises at different asinine levels
limit what it is that there's it's just penalty you know that
right so if you do have lots of combinations it's hard but it's been so long it
clearly there's no way we can even begin to do in any significant amount here unless we use multiple machine it's six hours
clearly there's no way we can even begin it's six hours
away it's easy to unhook the external desks put them back
so the question is where could we most shoes they sell
i was thinking perhaps if additionally to all these experiments with is that really research
do a lot but if they're if in fact there's something else he could be doing but us when we're sort of strapped for time

in might or might not agree that's the way it will be in ten years but that's
so we actually have an unusually large number and we tend to use here
so actually maybe i got sort of treat but
this is they're not running a video camera won't get this if you use
right this that's different than this
and at the training for the h. k. models it's always six four whatever language or testing
and there's the testing corpus
so then i think it's probably instructed to go and show you the features that we were talking about
without that's just baseline
to them because i think that for a bunch of their experience these so no cancer
course that's there and sincere
so for they've done and yes
neighbor essentially as it did me so he i'm i have a i a problem pronunciation
both of those two kinds are not back that

is very ten and i'm reading transcript transcript one three one that's one three zero three two three four seven six five three one six two for one six seven nine zero nine four zero three zero one five eight one seven three five three two six eight zero three six two four three zero seven five zero six nine four seven four eight five seven nine six one five seven eight two zero nine six zero four zero one too you don't actually need to say the name it'll
i once you get past the bridge that would be the worst and going to oakland
it's i mean it's still not going to be really easy but
i mean training and that's on the language and this thing up for another language
it depends it depends how you mean using the net so if you're or generic and that's but not trying to
the net so if you're talking about for producing these descriptive into features of time but you can't do
because see what they're asking for is a feature set
but the particular image that the cellular industry has right now is that it's distributed speech recognition where as the probably stick part and semantics and so forth are all on the servers and you compute features that on the phone so that's
ones but if that somebody is it with a different language you know here's what you're like there's less likely to have
without any licensing big deals
multi band
away which are the combinations crosses what are the most likely ones and

we should do they what i have for an agenda so far
what's going on me start over here
of it's i mean there's many different krisak differences so i'm not
and that's something you could ask a given limited
you could ask a given limited time i think the main thing is if it's a better thing for run across languages on this train tandem system
posted on the net how big is a depends into carpal put
right and so you know if you had three knesset loops that your choice of this choice for that right and you're going
and we have reached that does the machines are getting faster and faster so
because then it's if we do anything else we're going to end up having to do online normalization too so we may as just do
so we may as just do online normalization
over years if he's interested in you know voice silence he could do a lot but if they're

we should talk a little bit about plans for or the the field trip next week
funny like comes left there
one they call him but english the days him another one you said twenty two language english into it
the training i mean it's not crazy i mean these
working we have talked about i mean
correctly is sort of but what you're thinking of doing the short term
is it just but i can do better so it's so
probably would include all the combinations are actually talking about thousands of them or something and that's
but hundred is a lot
to my that i want to clarify my point about that are repeated has his
but the problem is if you ever get a new machine they take your machine away it's easy to unhook

so she's almost three d. i'm preparing
what you want to do is first was number each task
how do you know what languages
image someone picks up the phone right and but
and however you are it isn't actually a constraint in this evaluation
so that's your training corpus and then you're
the corpus and then you're testing corpus
exactly quickly again i think it's
because personal not backed up and second it
it's better to have things local if you're going to run over them right so especially if you're
i started looking at this distaste and david

so i'm not you know if we're going to include a bunch of car recordings in the training database i'm not if it's completely rules out for
with the trade issue when it's when when they when he met things we are when we read to sever use different languages because
just curious coming i mean i couldn't tell if you were joking or is
it's providing but
it's providing it if they're
mismatched in tennessee is mismatch channel
seven choose to would p. twenty one different combinations
honest but on one machine
you didn't on the spur i see a dozen and i suppose
distaste and david put do thrive on the habit it's an next desk which means it's

and then another topic i had was that dave here at said they give me something to do
we also have this broadcast news they were talking about taking off the disk which is this microphone data for perhaps
to fit into q.
whether you're retribution that focus too much on that christian great i mean
i haven't decided on initial thing probably
but simple someplace so many cupid sounds that
you can do when you're on that machine is just go to the slash scratch directory and do a d. f. minus k.
there it'll free up more space for doing experiments and things

so great choice but down that we the tax on benefits
he's got to go creatures is supposed to be good friend of mine
but they're just these you know countries that are pretty far apart from one another people wrote in on horses
my current
the inputs and the inputs are guilty and else
on right so you can walk around
servers so i the other question is what this cleared space there's there on the compensation servers
so you don't want to put anything in flash scratched you want to keep around for a long period of time

but that's press the most important issue as you're on the two extremes on the i think languages but we generally that today's general databases
but that's the image that they have it they could be that
the inputs are one dimension of the cube which
and that's the and that and then the testing would be these other things which might be foreign language
you're really your disks are now so
is these days if you got much crash space it doesn't increase the need for backup
that they could and the disks themselves and not that expensive
and and the other the last topic i had here was they've signed off for two do something and this and he's doing

and then can talk a little bit about discs in resource issues that's very good worked out and
the call friend is l. d. c. they're also to it that it today's
we've talked about it being p. l. p. and s. e. c. j. ross to rust out but your
maybe we can cut out sections in the queue for people to work
and so far i've copied a couple of carmen databases over there we haven't to them
but i think the first responsibility sort of to figure out if there's something that an additional
that's good thing rooms and like

i mean we're the band shouldn't be such an issue right because
because this is down samples and filtered right so it's just
i the question is how important is it to forced to get multiple languages
right and so we were the ones who have been weird by doing this training if we say
if it's in the phone but
but that's the image that they have it could it they could be that the service side
so i think that the it is an important issue whether works cross language

of the multiple and for the sort of meet anyone we were thinking about using the street database but
every installed h. u. k. the free version so
so everybody's now using three point no which is
to think it's really a gargantuan
and you know and then never times you that last part
signed a broker training corpus kim can use the tree a combinations of two languages
so one of the things that i need to i started looking at is just the perfect

something fucked pointless i make i mean these on these days in which school class mar phone are making these
in french from france the now the french is ria
in french from france the now the french is ria from paris so
a problem that we have very limited time
you put them all in the central that's in central files server then
server then when you're working with something and accessing it many times you copied a piece of that you're working with over to some places for the competition is and do all the work there
and come back we can charging and do

be the worst once you get past the turnoff to oakland
once you get past the turnoff to the bay bridge the turn off to the bridge
we've got something much better than outcast right it's
the newer ones so and angry
is but if you're careful with it i can do better
such as usual kind of sometimes say housekeeping right

so leaves us fifteen minutes before the
and wasn't operation the french friendship they tell too
what's so digits french database microphone speech
it's a possibility for that but these corpus there's a coleman the close friends so
than anything else you can think of p. should think about accomplishing i'm just
i'm just saying this because maybe there's things we need to do in preparation

worry so much maybe they we have a couple languages and the train sets and they can just enough rats that is that the rest does matter
was automatically first then and corrected but
and then that you have to worry about keeping that the same
was one day you'll show
it's still a little faster on the spurs to be
or either adam or aren't and it's an testing and they found

i think it would but on the other hand they might be better
that it's but you do have a baseline system it's the smoke absent
i'm just wondering about number parameters and then that you have
is it faster to do on and i think there's i think you folks are probably and the only ones using
you know so it's very limited time we actually have really quite a bit of competition will resource available if
and also if you have sorted out this information about how long it roughly how long it takes to do i'm white and you know what we can how many of these trainings and testings and so forth we can realistically do big goals of going there next week could be too to actually settle on which is them we're going to do

right it looks full of electrons
at adam did some testing or
more classes right more classes
on day he was in that got too close group i have
no i'm just saying i'm just thinking like loops right and so you

so would be easier for you if you came here and i drove
so if everybody can get here it's six
i've heard when you do that to get there in time so
that to get there in time so
so i'll just pull up in front of six and just be out front

what you just described what you've been doing so if
when i put these testings on their i'm assuming that there's i'm just kidding
that you know when i won't be contributing that much
for something i didn't understand
i wasn't that yes so start over so to tim attend labeled and

i mean some of the stuff's recorded in the car and some
point no which is the same version that would you guys you
ones so and angry thought anything depending on or
and i think stephens thing there's some broader stitchery on the french also we could use
desk which means it's not backed up so

we could use to meet
so it's funny around
so anyway that the basic plan is to testers cube
it depends it depends so that the guy was to get up a petition with what language can use then it cleaned up on that language or generic and that's but not trying
what an additional clever person could help with when we really a crutch for time

so i say this is the year two thousand we've got something much better
it's fish is a little bit like on gary and supposedly right
but i think there were several the phone so we're just hardly ever there
i think folks have been doing it to them because i think
i'm i've been kind of

but i mean i think the point is you have a bunch of labels and their hand and and marked
even if it's not matching just because
we have a lot more computational capability here than they do don't you i so i think
we actually had thought of this as sort of like not in stages but more on the time axis just
time axis just kind of like one stream at a time

the funniest thing spanish insane spanish
spanish
i think they were saying was that for this next test there's going to be some of the cases where they have the same type of noises you were given before hand in some cases where you're not
so presumably that'll be part of the topic of analysis of the test results is how you do when it's matching noise and how we do it
is just the perfect and talk about this

you do that you're increasing the size of the inputs in that you
in that you have to reduced or something so i mean so it does increase number trainings
i don't no know poison
the results and go no i'm just saying i'm just thinking like loops
put another i is another eighteen gigabytes that's in there now to help us with the media crunch

it broader training corpus and that's like timid
right more classes
do i. e. even begin to we state that and at the base too and to we'd if different then today age take program under son able
it's it j. ross is more complicated
so complicated because once you do

in you're creating files and things that you're going to need you probably want to have those on a disk that's backed up
so that could be another that mention but
another that mention but we think press can use the best no my to keep a genius using so we
so we army too that they used the animal
i think it's a good idea i mean it's it we seem to have enough to as

and mostly first about the logistics for it
no between two men
to get these things sorted out so it seems like
described rent a space and that this crack that we have for getting

can always count on serious of that corner so
something else that had we you talk too much
there is so sort of like the right transformation to do the filtering in is dependent on how much nicer is
d. the they just bunny duties

saying overnight we don't need to bring anything particular except or had a paper
you know that if you're using megabyte enough say that's very but of course
it's an testing and they found that this purport still faster and
do that they he's same it doesn't he does this in any flown to do that

so if you could remind me what you're going to be doing
i. from it's from texas so maybe
i knew decided to call him but and
so you just have a problem converting the label is it and

and there are so many other differences between these different databases i mean some
no we're going to be specially huntington
no we're going to be training on the noise that we do have huntington
yes i the question is how long does it take to do the training i

because you don't know who's going to call and you know i mean so it's
again yes so the training for h. t. cage is always that's always set up for the individual test right that there's some training
right that there's some training didn't intestines that's different
we're over the next year or two we're going to be upgrading the networks in this place

other than the languages or reason not to use to it something
mean it does seem to me that a lot of times when you train with something is at least a little bit noisy it can help you out in other kinds of times even if it's not matching
it actually has reached the point where it's a significant drag on the time for something to move the for one place to another
quickly was getting lots of and searching is what it was

just the multi band features
and then but then after that works meaning that
or is it you don't include that because
what about the net animal polite you guys do the kale transformation eight

it's tiny young yes done
that distributed with or
the newer ones so and angry
honest purport

the testing corporates or the same ones as or a test
so it seems like there's some peculiarities of the of each of these dimensions that are getting sorted out
and then if you work on getting the assembly lines and then the pieces sort of get ready to go to the assembly line then gradually
because it gets wiped out or something is that company the so

so that's three hundred and forty three different systems that are going to be developed there's
in things we know we have programs to compute p. you have
and see if we can calculate
it in my knee interpreting this correctly is sort

i think it's more the memory
but i was just realizing that actually it doesn't explode out
it's not really through the seventh but it's
the seventh but it's but it doesn't really explode out the number trainings because

and i changed day would just bunnies tooling nine that's what we've b. n. b. we use know because that's that b. n. p. i don't know
j. ross to has the potential to do better
and sunday rossi tend to do that
that outage because they've got on with an avid of dying and that they for the i be frightened but they're not as tools trained in it and that's what

i was just wondering does this mean the battery's dying and i should change it
turin and they're often not in great deal years so i mean i think it's
it's let's say it's six hours or eight hours or something for the training they c. k. how long's it for training

and again i the plan is
now can you include that the target language
from a purist standpoint it be not too because

so we had talked i we had talked at one point about maybe the language id corpus
yes using truck recruits kind of one hundred don't put so into it
i t. jokes they some but some prayer phone it's

friend is l. d. c. they're also to it that it today's one they
there's this is complex
i was and again because you would different languages have different words for different that just so it's

be right but i was hoping we could just do a test and determine if that was true
that's another one that's we must of them to change
line then gradually can start you know start turning the crank

if you have something that's just good for distinguishing different articulate very features that should just be good across you know range of languages
there's scratches smart putting and x. a. or x. p.
so i i'll need to

so i the spanish is like italian
so we've been talking about this cuba
getting more and more it's looking like we the board to think

i think you're doing this test because you want to determine whether or not having general speech performs as as having specific speech that's right
spanish in spain we're really
yes appeal peeing honesty i think definitely tracks we've had a lot

of system you know you're really asking the snap to learn
so something like this bouncing one
so it's just that people see the cheap cellphones as being still the biggest market

stop which
it's actually pretty common that a lot of the recognition systems people use have things like three thirty nine phone symbols right and then
right and then they get the variety by bringing the contact

or is it you don't include that because it's part of the basis
it's their own six horse i think
now we are getting more disk for the central file server

be interesting test just to have just to do m. i. c. with an or on that @reject@
it's not seen
i've been going through and copying data that is some kind of corpus usually that was got on a c. d. rom or something on to that need is to free up space on other disks and

and everything else the same compare that was just
same compare that was just that m. s. sixty without
within that it's wonderful without that

themselves are just specify the signal ones don't much fishing they
much fishing they corrupted themselves but they also
it seems to me that we want to do is flesh out what you put on the board here

just because there's some more variance built into things but
exactly how it work dependent on how near it is too much
spanish this study threats

that's but how long does it take we think for one of these
it's so for instance i think the major advantage of m. s. g.
so you could be we have quite a few spurred ports you could set up

trainings because these are all trained individual
so that's what i was saying you could check slash scratch on those on mustard and that may to see if there's space that you could use there you could also use
you could also use slash x. whatever discs on mustard and that may

so long because was the tape it about how many hours
because the you know the thing that said no was talking about with the label labeling the database that to the noise and but
with the thing was running through these models very quickly was getting

so you don't especially something with repetitive complication you're going over multiple times you do you don't want to the data that you're working on distant from where it's being where the competitions be done if you can help
since it's not a competition server which seem to be a contradiction to what i just said
but the idea is that suppose you're working with this big bunch of different multi lingual databases

this season on the but
then maybe later on the meaning we should talk about we actually you know might accomplish

i mean not that there's anything to famine tori about eight five seven or anything but
so here's what i have for i'm just jotting down things i think we that we should do they

find holes in some things that someone could use some help with these phone turned out
fall back to the but i think

so six a. m. front six am
busy or people actually corrupted themselves are just specify

that was a real important
silence any with things like that got especially if it's like

and not such she's turning pop
the remaining popped a useful testing and we what kind of

d. i'm preparing to do h. t. baseline for this task
there's i think i i know that i mean i'm not language but i hungarian and finish and one of the languages in the former so you or in the sort of same family

insecure we get we went to i know treat three dimensions
to work on and i know that defines working from a and t. machine so

quote friends language and identification what
so this could be a program or because

so that's what you're thinking of using sort of the maltese equivalent of the multiple what sort of meet anyone
requires some tables and

if we say no you have to have a different features set for each language i think this is very bad
i mean in principle i mean can sexually it's sort of like they want every they want replacement for mel caster

yes i don't i know force fortunate i see what you're coming where you're coming from i think but i think we can
i think but i think we can ignore

so we really ask who do tests with riyadh coarse language i mean
final test laughter the final test i is supposed to be german and danish right

so i would say if it looks like there's a big difference to put it in then we make note of it and then we probably put in the other because we so many other
especially when you go over the different languages and again because

other because we so many other problems in trying to get things to work here that you know it's not so bad as long as we know that we say look we did do this
so ideally what you want to do is you want to with and without the target language and the training set for a wide range of languages and pressing

and they aren't you know the exception finish which i is pretty different from most things
it's most of them are like at least some of the others

so i've been looking at timid
that's right thing the only problem i have with it is exactly the same reason why used to be a good thing to do

i was for different that just so it's
so i was just wondering if the fact that commit using the hand able from tenet might be confuse the results i

but it's better it may be better because but so probably isn't
i mean you i i'm trying to cavalier but i mean i think

i actually and it was not entirely him it was automatically first
languages because some funny some it's different languages

corrected but it might be a better source
right it would be another interesting thing to the question to ask is it because it's a broad sorcerer because it was you know carefully

what about the differences in the phones
i mean at least conceptual you know does mean you actually have to do it

six
academically it makes sense as a baseline

there's not much difference
the ones that are gone i think or think there was they also intimate may like a colossal stop which

treat but there's
do you want to do so even though the media recorder doesn't

i think it's a good idea the cube i mean
to talk about the whole cuban maybe we can cut out

get this if you use aboard it'll help us mean
the cube we'll have three dimensions first other

the point at one of the limitations of this idiot but
idiot but you've got the word on right so

j. a terrorist
j. and terrorists edgy

meaning that we would have on your end it works that can enter into strokes for each bound
and is it french or belgian

and using the you know put something the torque solid and you put so i think that
system think that his money imports in mexico

then he likes belgian fries too
and then we have broader corpus like tenet

spanish something really
to know with the holidays in the middle to get a lot done if

but the door in spanish and
there's spanish testing in there and the kids

november
something like seven things in each each column so that's

@reject@ what about north conditions and hundred and fourteen h. west
so we need to put in calling for confidence conditions

but just kind of happen won't take a huge on developments just trying
so we actually can be quite a few experiments but how

developments just trying
we just select multiple i just had the teachers no can't

point major events venice g. i. c. that we seen the past is combined is guilty
now this is turning into fourth dimensional too

not complete accommodations that right what
it's not a complete set a combination so

or something no so it does increase number trainings
what's great about this is it sets it up in a very systematic way so that

just competition limit it doesn't so
and they're like a limit on the competition hardly see or something like that for working we have talked

language then combined or is that actually one that and
no they got but and this and acrylic today h. t. got four months to combat

so i the first thing is if you know how much how long training takes
thirty hours of speech i think they need that

it depends does for training and testing you
moses see so for they've

you didn't on the spur part i see a dozen and i suppose
again we do have a bunch of spur it

is it faster to do on the spur
don't know used

just got take that sort of thing
it is we do a problem that we have

or we're not going to get through any significant number
so that i think it's just that the missing pieces that you need to talk to talk to

and you know when we go to gee i next week we can present to them you know what it is that were doing and
doing and we can pull things out of this list that we think they're doing sufficiently that you

we're going to it's not actually broader class actually finer
class actually finer class but you mean

right more class but you mean more classes
because once you do that you end up in some funny domain and they end

nup conned
it's not as many times labeled

blows in different farm that
that day farm out to afford day program tool training to then ended what i knew decided

i've been too computing personally so
so those are competition servers so i

so chuck would be the one be starting out but this needs to be where and so on and i'll be the one
and i'll be the one who says spending money

it's not backed up and all these flashes be something if it is backed up if it's
up if it's inside the machine on the desk it's called i scratch but the problem

i just another question occurred to me is what were you folks to do about normalization
we were thinking about using this system i think need for old experiments

i think it's army too that they used the animal
i think it's a good idea i mean it's

it is so probably if we take their probably
take their probably down nine line normalization because

the noise and but that really throws things off you know
you know having the noise all of a sudden you're speech detector i mean did

the only problem i maybe
problem i maybe that's right thing the only

is very ten and i'm reading transcript

in and kind of go around two people been doing talk about that progress report essentially

and i have failed so far in doing that in some way we

that in some way we can discuss that little bit find holes

that corner so

i think that means studies to be

so one of to start this so this monday and things

i eat it was kind of my bright idea to have a stick a plane that leaves at seven twenty in the morning

the issue is how old we ever accomplish that

and and that was funny time you take

to the bay bridge the turn off to the bridge

i mean just go down martin luther king

and then my luther king's nine eighty eight eighty and it's

so on you tube it's being a little bit but

but you know don't bring footlocker and will be

overnight i figured it would need a great big suitcase it's

a great big suitcase it's

now be fine i just it for me it just means getting a half hour earlier usually

that's constantly carrots and

i've added too went pop student or too noises

the h. t. k. baseline so this is using no concern so

that's cute what

that's cute what

so is that did you task they to that different task and finished ask so

that's numbers with stems i mean you're on the truck strain on the past they don't

and then to see three times with your the road train home they come from the same language it's possible but we're using a more generic that today's which is funny could predict about on some

it's a possibility for that but

what anyway these corporate saw one speech so

because the and speech type database on the telephone speech

that to great choice but

it because of this whole thing is for two helping new standards for the telephone

but then the idea to compare the future but all before sending them to what

i know but the reason what you don't do that sends pictures and he chose compared to them did you i feel

did you happen to find out your point is that it's it's the teachers a computed locally and so they aren't necessarily telephone then or telephone distortions so you

did you happen to find out anything about the o. j. multi lingual distortions

that's that's what i meant i said it's

i said say was there's no g. i. language id not the call

but it's also it on speech

right so it's just the fact that it's not telephone

security at a moment's for you do not want to use these don't do to be we ever give english spanish and french with microphone speech

and for the difference in another context too but this actually they just treated they just generic the

too actually they just treated they just generic the base so

for eight i am which because the spanish french and it it gets if the kids training is that and also more generic and it doesn't

and perhaps we were thinking that perhaps the across language issue is that the biggest issue whether you're retribution

it depends how you mean using that's but not trying to

than outcast right it's you know gobbled look and so

image someone picks up the phone right and but

the phone right and he picks up the but do you get vacation

there's target english but petition so is it

but no you pick up the phone you talk

on the phone it ten features that

it could be but that seems they have right so side

years but that's that's what they're asking for so

now it's c. o g. i folks perspective right now they're probably that's not the biggest deal that

the other thing is this notion of training to which i they're starting to look it up there training to something more like articulate tory features

i mean for instance training on english and i think any time you know

which to too dependent the

so ultimately is this thing i think it doesn't fit within their image that she switch it's based on language

then you can say when because shirley

of languages and that way you can say you know we're going to build it for what we think are the most common ones but if

because the truth is that it's not like there are you know although there are thousands of languages from the point of your cellular companies aren't stairs

aren't stairs this fifty or something you know

see i spent last week looking over stefan shoulder and understand so data

but are you going to be a someone

resistance

choice there which is or peterson

on initial thing probably something like you

so you say take peel t. and do it they you use say c. k. with it with the transformed features using their own that strained and the training

and the training could either be from to just self or from ten and that's the and

i get in the picture about the cube

a picture either so i'm i i'm nothing worse off but

when you said that you're getting the labels for ten minutes are you what you mean i'm just

you mean we're the digits i'm just transforming them from the the standard timid transcription into a long huge piece

or those were automatically to ride bewitched

i was just wondering because that test your i think you're doing

corrected but

so we put into these episodes it's funny i think it's what's funny to fall training languages

yes mister percent it yes it's

but and play something in space induced bunnies class so that funk that does not be i mean the unity sons up to oakland pretty

but forgot inmates we must and do a lot of the fork because we need two candidates mutant sense creation four day that the debate that

as opposed to dixie something

i forget if that happened starting with you or was it or if for was there torture did that but i think

and i think some of them they were making distinctions between silence at the end and sounds at the beginning

and really they're both silence any

especially if it's like ours which is this kind of system you know you're

there's not much difference it's kind of hard

to talk about the whole cuban maybe we can cut out

do you want to do so even though the media recorder doesn't this is they're not

you walk around you know

first i mentioned is the features that we

and the second dimension is the training corpus

and that's training on that discriminate knowing that

the last dimension happens again yes so the

so let's see help me out it could hippy

so they would be much better before before the torque i mean

that it's but you do have a baseline

for that training corpus we have that that digits for the various languages

and spanish and french it's something that we can use in addition to or

@reject@ they it makes the kind of thing

system imports in mexico gets pretty

so every always insists adults is absolute or france has nothing to do

t. i. digits

i. digits all these a or that up that is from is to ride from t. i. digits

i'm just curious coming i mean

no you were joking or is it mexican spanish or is

no spanish or is no it's

no never the funniest thing it's spanish insane spanish

in spain we're really covered there

covered there

and ten minutes from lots of different from t. i. from it's from

with within the train corporates we're thinking about training with noise

incorporating the same kinds of noises that or isn't incorporating in their training corpus

i don't think we were given d. the unseen noise conditions

so i we can't train on and and seen noise conditions it's not

we're going to get german right

hello one hundred eighty @reject@ what hundred and hundred

type see and they're all going to be test tested with one training of h. d. cases them

them there's a script that test all three different types of noise conditions test days like

test days like i matched noise s. b. is

s. b. is slightly mismatched in

you know a lot of these things but just kind of happen won't

what about combination that's

we just select multiple things on one dimension i just had the teachers no can't

just competition i don't think so

so it's not really limit what

forth and

so what it blows out is the number of testing

part that last part i think it's so it's got to be pretty quick so

running the data through you guys

what about the net animal you guys do the kale transformation eight

is that just separate nets for each language then combined or is that actually

or is that actually one that and good prevent

good question prevent the one that's one

that would i don't think we've tested

if we can train up all these combination then we can start working on testing of them individually and in combination i

because putting them in combination i think it's not as much competition is their training and that's the first

didn't get mother teach then there's the so we can you guys training these chemicals and what

teach coming and what

you do have lots of combinations but it's been so long it

it depends does for training and testing

and think if she sees no

i'm we're running and what machine

i don't know what ravioli is is an ultra

is an ultra five versus

i don't rule billiards

again i think it's see it's not so long because

so we i mean it's playing a sheen

i mean it's playing a sheen turin and they're often

so i mean i think it's keys that that you look at machines too fast machines are used a lot

i mean once you get the basic things set up you have just all the all these combinations right

posted on the net depends

try and i know done that's one was

boards and have ten other jobs running on different computers just got

i kind of like this because what did not

available if you know again look across the institute now little things being used

all the work so i don't see how would do it so

would do it so i like about this is it listed all the things that we already know how to do

and all the kinds of data that we at this point already have

sort out about what's the best way to really you know attack this as a as a mass problem in terms of using many machines

and then you know set it up in terms of scripts and so forth kind of some kind of structured way

and for the broader class and that's what we're going to increase that because

that because the the digits that's when we correspond to about twenty four names

we're going to it's not actually broader

carmen you if something else that had we

i don't know it's up to date what does that if even know because that's so jesus

which is supposed to be sensitive to the amount of noise there is so sort

and they end up having to do a transformation afterwards which

so it's it's a little messier

there's more ways that can go wrong

i think two tool record day it got young deviate we've stayed know they're but in out on that one

on bushel to trying another no then that's what we do bunnies d. v. d. the they just

and they work and

but to be a bad day did that base i d. few close watch for

watch for me no what's that difficult what last week would that outage because

for something i'd be seen that the race was not as ultimate because he we h. d. kind

it's not as many times neighbor essentially labeled i'm i have

i wasn't that yes so start over so to tim attend labeled

despite his name on that

know what i yes and eating i got two down and he said i can do that

that i didn't i eat seeing that when and they got icon sounds far two axes format on h.

on h. d. guy you sound except for a and i

and that was something cake but

something cake but what i know close the kind of do that

so that once he's always monday but real problems get sorted out we can just start turning the crank and

i was thinking two things first

things first thing was

at a time to check out the results and

i still we could do a lot of i money

and the second thing was about scratch space and keep sending

and keep sending you know about scratch space for people to work on and

machine so his home directory exists somewhere else is somewhere else

his home directory exists somewhere else is somewhere else

me too late for this precise crunch right now but

it's going to take a couple weeks at least to get amount of disk be beginning we're actually going to get

for more thirty six gigabyte

that we have for getting another just cracking for more drives to share between primarily this project in the meetings

and are you doing your competitions if you say you're

if you say you're on t. machine choosing

on t. machine choosing some external much into

it's making this done i think to

i these are these competition servers or something i'm i've been kind

unfortunately stays days idea running type of kind of addicting competitions running spreadsheet so

and i'll tell you if there's space available

it i think dave was saying that he preferred people didn't put and slash scratches smart

there's different there x. p.

right so there's the flashbacks whatever desks and then they're slash scratch

and if it's called slash scratch it means it's probably an internal but to the machine

and so that's the kind of thing where like if if you don't have an m. t. v. have a unix workstation and they attach an external desk it'll be called slash x. something if it's not backed up and

put them back on the new machine but then you're slash

machine but then you're slash scratches gone

right so especially if you're right if you're taking some piece of the training corpus which usually resides and we're trucks putting it on thee file server it's fine it's not backed up

we haven't to them off of slash p. c. disk that they're on right now

but we i would like to go through sit down with you about some of these other ones and see if we can move them onto this new disc also

so far i've copied a couple things but i haven't

a couple things but i haven't deleted anything off of the old this to make

and i haven't looked at the the roar

except for the spanish so

a good idea i mean it's it we seem to have enough to as it is so probably

like maybe we were re there are almost there is goals for the for next week's meeting

to be someone visual that

phoenix so you mean you may have had other girls are going up

and this and he's doing he's working in other things

but to do something and this project so the question

but i mean it's running programs

trying to have a closer look at perhaps to speech depiction all it's home and voice on detection

it was happening with the thing was running

and his recognition the only

because stays can be around for a long time

done if can think of something some piece of this that's going to

the very fact it is sort of just work and it's running programs and so forth is exactly why it's possible that it some piece of it could be handed to someone to do because it's

so that's the question i mean not something

i mean not something right this second but if we can think

but if we can think of some peace that's to find that she could help with these expressing

what with these expressing

about training if they a multi lingual matt
