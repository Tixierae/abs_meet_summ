this is eric and on channel three i believe
i mean we have a stair
i think we're session for by the way it
this jane on mike number five
on you know eventually we're probably going to want to distribute this thing and we should decide how we're
and we should decide how we're going to handle some of these factors
and so we're collecting corpus and i think
carbon monoxide poisoning that we should do short meeting
get it regret aircraft
like that unless of course they're funding issues and then
issues and then and i mean they may not toothpaste too but
right so and just requires human just like the just to p.
and then also if it's a repair where there's like what i just did then it's to have sort of a sense of the comedy the outer it's the start
the outer it's the start to be to finish and
but is there any way it's a great environment
but is there any way dorsey trick our to it actually it's a great environment
to it actually run it through that's an interesting
we've thought about doing that but the recognition quality idea hey
we've thought about doing that idea hey
error rates right but was but again the timing is perfect should be for free the timing should be
so what she's done and but in the absence of most specific instructions trying to figure out what the mystery things do is what would you
so what she's done so far is sort of more or less press not preference or phrases continuous phrases mystery things do is what would you
and so that's because you separate when you do an extract you get a little silence on either end so that seems to work
but you know there's a like between when you hear twenty compress return keesa slightly delayed
but that would make a difference
to you and forgetting all the words because you i was thinking i'd
i mean that's part of the problem is because you i was thinking i'd be cheating a little bit familiarity but
when they should that you did it again i mean that's part of the problem is that what we really needed somebody else to come along bit familiarity but
when they should that you did it again from scratch and then there's the kind of somebody else to come along
and then there's the kind of actually developing three
so it that might be worth doing that's good like that
that would at least elsewhere it's worth spending a week or two trying to get a tool that will compute segment patients and i think
patients and i think even mine too about this tool guys is it you can do the competition for what we're going to do in the future but if you'd
but if you'd always talking about doing two or three or five times as much and they can use the same tools and israel multiplier there the other
i mean it's good that there's going to be in the meetings as a major that's like one of the two things
like i mean it's good that there's going to be in the meetings like the reading group meeting that we have the other day that this going to be a bit of a problem because that's like one of the two things
that'll right making fun that's in sitting worthwhile anyway right
might save ninety percent of the work though but
so i need to we need to look at what the final output is but it seems
i've already become pretty familiar output is but it seems like we doesn't it seems like it's not original with not to have mostly tool to generate phrase monks and it's because in secret see without putting the what or be so great
i've already become pretty familiar with the format so it would be or be so great
easy if you tell me where it is we just finished the part of work already completed on this to me i mean you
to me i mean you talked a little bit about the transcription conventions and
tools i mean i look at cyber transcriber which is a it's true
which is a service that you send an audio file they do a first pass
but its going to be horrible they're never going to be
they're never going to be able to do a meeting like this no it just approximately
this for cyber transcriber no it just approximately once you find out in terms of price or whatever
for cyber transcriber they don't quote a price they want you
they want you to call and talk so for
thirty so for thirty or action
for thirty dollars an hour for of their work action
so if it ten times as three hundred dollars an hour so three days three hours
so if it ten times as three hundred dollars an hour so three days three hours
an hour they want will have to mix they went over so if it's who knows if they're going to be able them manage multiple channel
definitely he's worth fifty an hour you
you could do it like multiple until you get
i just pressed happens on the next you know to me it's very they thought
in polite i thought it was you was
we have to mock those stomach they that sleeping on locked i had i
but any time that becomes ambiguous is if you have to speak because
like if you if any of one cousin of have one full discontinued across a ticket time boundary you just need i want to each and then it's picked up a difference
but other people have other interest but it does feel
but it's description and i must of let's
what a good idea that's we can have pay for click throughs
actually i shouldn't be allowed to by my if you just did a crappy job nobody would want you to do
actually i shouldn't be allowed to by my includes grandparents he's job nobody would want you to do
it's people you w. want to look at it i mean it's
one each other's to have to do if it makes it so they can actually kind of the same books
@reject@ and to see this is really the way people said in the stable
if you had depends on the books right true
i didn't understand @reject@ one deal this box did this box as a one off deal being the wiring box
it's that's wonderful that's amazing
empowering decide a couple days ago not to do it somebody to build it
which to say it was a week to get this report done

it's very badly nine it's very badly defined why it's not and we just go to years designed
i believe the channel it's like friend number channel this microphone their own
it's just a jewellery fan
no we can @reject@ no wonder what their webpage and answered too
all s. a. e. corpus of spoken american english
already some sort of plan in place for how this is going to be staffed are done or is
that's part of the are done or is real that we're talking about here
right so one of one option is to get linguistics grad students and undergrads to do it and conventions hurst
so i've had zero the answer zero there's reason she sits and
i've had zero then we can't do any chance corruption because and
corruption because we're we
it be a bit i mean morgan so in a bind over this and the thing to do it in exchange
over this and the thing to do is to just do the field of dreams theory which is we
right the money and if that's the best we can do it but you could not
right talking to people about that i'm afraid i haven't made any person that front she just
so that's can over the fact that n. x. number hours
it doesn't do any speech recognition doesn't no it doesn't
that's true and so if the issue that's interesting
be we don't care about that i mean it works
really and it's really the interface
really and it's really the interface wonderful because
wonderful because you know the time it takes as you listen to it and then you press return key
but then you know it's like you press the tab key to stop the flow and the return key to put in a marking of the boundary
we could program that pretty easily could have again case it has other
we could program that pretty did i mention and not in this case it has other
miss mister t. c. l. i would've thought so interesting pull
take they did that you already transcribed
is this already in the past already in future
that's right we would we got the oracle boundaries from
you know that automatic boundaries millionaire you want to know you given a perfect human segment asian i mean you want to know how i mean me
enough i can generate the segment patient and you could do the words and time yourself on it so a little double blind here kind
probably like expensive microphone i mean that's a beach
should have been i don't know looking for too
what are they they cover plan would be they're very minimal so
so we want if we did something like programs in the delay which actually i think is a great idea i'm they would want that incorporate they're pretty late i do too
and so i think that often you can't tell me jane that's true that's very
but puzzling because he was in the other room talking
and to question mark colin is fine for that just what's that's an idea
just say silent what's that mean you mean
sets when you want to do damn
but yes it's a good job of it he should be allowed
i which reduces also site maps
even if it's just writing things up right i mean it's the early on
that's precious be pump it this about so the wires go through here
so why do could go either way so go to the diagonal here
but they're is the plug in and of each of these it cables and lawyers
he had there's no clever way to let the upstream guys know that you're really not being powered so
receiver and i can't thing and they had the wrong
and they had the wrong five so i ended
five so i ended up not recording one of the channels and recording that makes interesting

besides i don't really having one of those days it's you'd be welcome be
besides i don't want anyone who has a weird accent days it's be welcome
i just started doing do anything more
so we've done before up no we can do that i know what that
which means we need to move this thing so they can put them
good right that's not great sounds what i mean is
into so i can actually arrange for it to arrive in short order for
i'm and then things like repairs and false starts and filled pauses and all that other sort of we decide how much of that we want to do i did
to do i did include caught a certain first passed my
passed my view on it once when you have every pair then it seems i
which time we can around and kind of one of the things you're saying it's like you have the oceans put in more or less timing pay
no it finished by the end of the day
no but the thing is the fact that she's she did before just might give a lower bound that's all it's end of the day exactly
case and it's not really strict comparables i think those
it's thirty dollars an hour isn't the rate but we can pay through that
handle because they might get more right the first
texas people
and then to get to the next i just pressed happens
them because i figured if there's a limited number and i keep him too
user interface so it's didn't go the whole route today
it's just there's no user interface for specify multiple any more than two so you're
time it comes on big is if you have more than one speaker and that and the of swamp
i can have one track i menu you know and been hooked on it
how often does that happen you think
we going to run out of disk space but
so is there maybe we should just consider it beep in the other room and the difference
which is that there's the that you've been describing jane id one has to course it indicates is very interesting and i'd
but i all i could i couldn't find at the local store but this
you trying to screw up the of people realize that early
p. d. a. let the record show this is exhibit to be
healthy industry them around the table the because they're there
and i'm just not what that is me some sort of cabinet
a pain so you end up with this thing that
if you stuck to mixer up here and the top open to be fine you wouldn't necessarily

see on channel four what i'm doing wrong
my lucky day no
the meter which tells you what the levels on the various mikes are and there was
for some more money to do more do so we were playing
scale of it but i see what effect with this @reject@ i was learning
this is the meeting about the meeting innings
@reject@ right we already we are you already of a plan in place the first meeting
it be a bit i mean morgan there's also the other possibility which is if you can provide not money but instructional experience or some other perks and you could get people to do it in exchange
and a lot of the me she typos and things like having
i mean it depends on the error rates right but was but
said deal although i you know the alternative which i sort of experimenting with before i run its time recently was that you know even if it were like a arbitrary segment of time pre marked because
pre marked because it does take time to put those markings and it's
this delays adjustable see a lot of people
we're going to leave we're going to need ten oaks transcribed @reject@ you think of from ten extra five actually doing it
we're going to leave we're going to need ten to a hundred hours to train the tools and validate the tools to do to do all this anyway so many of from ten extra five actually doing it but
this upcoming
newsletter
there were two people speaking during part of it and
even during the meeting there's a lot of overlap and it's marked pretty
and it's marked pretty clearly
i'm some of the back channel jane had some comments and but
and he said i don't see anything
but when you listen to we know what we it in the context of you know he can't hear what are you saying
know it sounds like the money problem thing into software it's to suffer any handles to powell channels
you know it's like @reject@ but what are you talking about for website hack you're talking about writing
what i mean plastic they sort of look like this
that's precious be pump it this about so the wires go through here
this or it's not be convention

this is one channel
it seems like it's not the corpus which is has been done before and so i think
and so i think people will be interested in having it so using like all your d.
good question i can't answer
that new that they had some funding problems in completing it but
this was like phase one clever custody
and they there's still more that they're going to do or something like that unless
into so i when i it just quick quickest for me in terms of the transcription part to say something like you know if adam spoke to to just say eight colin
it because you have a lot more experience than i do but if that's not
@reject@ and then and i increase my income i can start doing the transcribing
what are they they cover and so my next plan would be
they're very minimal so good just to summarize it so
each other and then at the same time the tops part of the screen as the actual verbatim thing you can clip
their limits number speakers you and you can it you can work pretty between those two things
and so using this the convention the chain i've discussed you can have as many overlapping speakers as you want is this a
french just the french supper
they're linguists people
you can you're saying i think you can read
you can read and write as many as you want it's just that
dancer sort started the we could have like business to business ecommerce
dancer sort started the we could have like business to business ecommerce as
your paper off my p. d. a. boxer let
so you can imagine to microphones because the cheap it down it's all require locals
so you can imagine some sort of in some sort of patch panel on top to figure out what the mapping was between each of these two and each of those one @reject@ locals i would i
the simplest thing i can imagine it which is really simple still quite literally decent plug in
that's kind of i see think that you plug it in you know it depends on and in your life now

i still don't see jane darn
you feel so good that way that's right that's what i have
you feel so good when i stop
in fact get for free because
any of the court this core c. s. a. e. corpus
several minutes right but anyway enough to work with
there the other thing too is with the speaker domestication if i
so thirty forty thousand dollars
ten thousand dollars so meanwhile what was
like to unfortunately
dollars an hour
channels was also they
i mean are they linguists or the speech recognition people
they have some connection the l. d. c. because he l. d. c. has
i think what eric was i see quit so
because i was listening did was agreeing a lot too things that you were saying as you were talking
went and what i wasn't talking to you
hire an infinite it was actually it was quite it was
i job of it he should be allowed to you know
let's move on to electronics topic
mean the boxes it pretty much out of the way anyway i'm the
in six hangs out half nations that the two
right we want to do that so this notion of putting got a peezie m.'s taken away would somehow have to be turned into leaving them on the table or want
did you do any mechanism mix out

but number has to be
i that's the point a lot
topic of this meeting is i want to talk a little about transcription
i assume so actually i hadn't thought about
i think i was really pleased to see that new that they
so to find a day when they're going to be here and morgan is going to be here and
and i think list on some too on that it that you get it bracket is in terms of like
it's parent that which i know this is worked on then you do after because i like aspects
pass i mean people have to look at it more than once to make that's been done correctly but i just can't
and things like having it occurs to me that it may be a lot easier to correct things it is to do things from scratch no matter how wonderful tool this but
tool this but if there was a way to merge the two
i mean we talked about it but i mean but sometimes it's easier to type out something instead of going through figuring out which is great i mean it depends on the
keesa slightly delayed so then you
that's right we would comparables i think those proposals to be used a new batch of text having it done yet in the same eating could on the next segment
yes it is eight quite amazing they might quota
this is overlapping murder and if there was a word like right
see you said the word t. c. allen and that's but yes it's a good
me who wants to do that though
not just leave them all i'm not i'm going up to them going down looks like
i'm just saying that for the recording

say your name and talking to your mike one at a time
i don't think it's on there jane
this jane on channel five
nine it's very badly defined why it's not and we just go to years
nine it's very badly defined why it's not and we just go to years
defined why it's not so it's also card is with to years
but there's nowhere to put the pants it's comfortable any kind of or that's he's his
the pants it's comfortable that's he's his temple
so ten thousand dollars so meanwhile what was
three hundred meanwhile what was it thirty times i'm
to morgan about it i live out of that unspoken they just mean just work today
but if that's not feasible i will do it with you as an advisor
to so i gave him a proposal for the transcription conventions he made his suggestion
he made his suggestion prove it that
prove it that's a good suggestion so as far
speakers as you want is this a university project
process linguistic data consortium
because it seems like there was a difference you wanted to indicate

this is eric time microphone number three
this is back on mike four
get it sitting here regret aircraft carrier clothing
get it sitting here like that's right regret aircraft carrier clothing up to stay
not great but far what i mean is that
just but far afield means great distance i mean that
actually that's another thing i was thinking so when she gets here maybe that might be good thing for her
i was even thinking that maybe we need to at least paying the you've got to see you know we need to talk to them some more
train the tools
and then it's picked up a difference because picked up it's a
that's the end of the stick the transcript but it post continued
that's great there maybe we should just consider also sort of build up the website around all of these things you know other room and the difference
things are that i think we should say i was in tunnel definitely
at the local store but this is the technology takes a little bit thinner and this is two
so why do we have sixteen channels instead of like some fewer number either way have here
fewer number healthy industry because the
enough and actually it's my plan is to only bring eight wires on the spot

i try speaking loudly so like the high quality labeling that better hello
we don't want to remember them because i bet
to remember them because we've already have like forms filled out with numbers on them so what's
on them so what's keep the same numbers on him casket
the games are you on and i'm on to
i mean when things morgue and i were talking about is we're going to get to know this room really
what i was thinking is it may be useful in transcribing if it's hartfield right
that's i mean they're really respected in the linguistics to decide to underscores very
i mean we talked about it but i mean but sometimes it's easier to type
i mean we've got a elimidate's they good point
and fraught the words but keep the time
and if it's only our time where are of course includes
what's your plan to carry on doing it
especially for meetings i didn't use it very often
that the two it's a jack should be in the front and a little

so it's not the musician
just get a variety i think candles
just get a variety they're very good i think candles would be if they don't make noise
so we can get that just with media costs is there still point
there's some interesting human factors problems like what's pan of of time is useful to segment thing into in order to transcribe at the most quickly because i know you get like
to visit it's just using is strictly it would take
end so that seems to work really that's
so i think that we can count on that being about what they would do it would probably be a little right
more because we're going to want them to do speaker a lot
what i mean is that what i mean when somebody says a high in the middle of it great that happens very seldom
i and you know it could be made more precise that but i just

no but maybe it may be useful in how you mean mechanical adaptation or
is which isn't very time consuming
it so again i have to say are we recording and then say thank you
be we don't care the timing should be
actually developing three times
and equal and instead of entering the interface for speaker that education and clicking on the thing and syndicated speak variety so
no i'm not saying this is what professionals who actually do this kind of thing for video or for audio where you need to do this and so have that i see
i think what eric was talking about was channels other than the direct speech right i see quit so
we could actually maybe we could use that to help like can what h. texas
see you trying to screw up the microphone @reject@ of people realize that early
you wouldn't necessarily

but it would also maybe so this is a very good purpose
that front she just should you know i
or is that really just i actually that's the one people
or is that really just i actually that's the one people usually use ten x.
how fast are you and i haven't really calculated how fast
maybe you could try the following experiment take they
it's on the order of eight to ten i think that would say is
to carry on doing it
you know what i thought was right now we have to so i gave
the next version channels was also multi channel
looping until you get crazy and decide to stop likely through that or

so i again would like to do some digits i'm going to close or
this @reject@ i was learning also be ready
but a super tool it's a great environment
so for other services they were about thirty dollars an hour
only one it was otherwise going to be puzzling because
but when you listen to it was a lot funnier if we know what we it in the context of you know he can't hear what are you saying
right it's and if that five people see once
if we use the little the conventions that jane has established i have the script that will convert from that convention to their saved convention
so i think the other thing i'd like to do is do something about this set up so that it's so
set up so that it's a little more presentable and organize i agree

no i'm just that sort of just sort of guy
how much i don't think eight dollars would do you know what the going rate it's it's on
and they have they've actually asked if we are willing to do any development i
do you mean by that i didn't worry about
start i'm just sort of thought that this measly processed anyway
if u. h. but in any case i didn't mark those
usually ultra likes to
i was wrestling

right and so what but they're still the same issue of managing the process of reviewing and keeping the file straight and all this which is clearly hassle
and so what i'm saying is that if we hire an external service i think we can expect three hundred dollars an hour i think
but it post continued like to
equal money equal i
either is fine because what i have is not like to my transcription that i have on my account because
we websites what and just if you're doing h. texas
he committed himself
several and has a few right so we can added

besides i don't really having one of those days it's you'd be welcome be
that was me erica you into goes regional hypothesis right i see
and so that's why they're getting with just two channels or something or the using
or something or the using multiple that's
as possible so if someone said in the middle of of someone's international contour i indicated it as like what you just said
then i indicated as a segment which contained this other and plus an overlap

it's supposed to be and had mounted
and had mounted
that's put on your head what are you doing right
i you are saying that i could hear really welna
i mean i would prefer that people weren't i that i could hear really welna in the transcription i mean
i mean i would prefer that people weren't on their head but they were i mean

because it's not it doesn't go over the years it's badly
are you going to do something other than to quit
grad students i don't know it i don't know at the where there
and he said is it i wasn't talking to you
and that's a comments the rest
no thing topic we got to take a disc

but they also mention that they have time aligned massive i
of shown playtime would have to for me like
everyone's more or less everyone you talk to says about ten times for hard technical transcription using what using study using
you have to turn off your mike you take a bathroom break in the middle and keep it
you have to turn off your mike in the middle and keep it
and so he was is sort of viewers are talking you know so that

too but from all the web documentation to look like this is phase one whatever
you know that automatic boundaries millionaire you want to know you given me
so this is going to go in the meeting transcriber bloopers tape right this is unusual there's sickness
and then you could track weather was same secret not by knowing you know at the end of this unit
but they're cables and there's only four slots that are
but they're cables and there's only four slots that are you know in the first version or the version or playing to build so that was the whole

so has a useful tickle t. k.'s are in their face
u. h. age h.
i'd be happy with that'd be fine
i did notice that there were some segments be good to have that and they and the conventions what's jeeze
i did notice that there were some segments that had pauses on the beginning and then we should probably mark what's jeeze
we should probably mark areas that have new speakers as no speaker

and to the things we that we know that i know i want our the tax to the start and the speaker
more expensive could joy to do at all
we'll just get joy n. j. and to do everything that was for it
for this so there should be a subset of them used for just use the ones that and for this may so
need like a way to tell whether you're boxes life so the only wouldn't be so if you
so they're actually six x. are out in the back there and receiver and

use and so the next decision which has to be made actually pretty soon is how are we going to do it until
going to do it so until you make changes the first one so that she can decide
so you'll get down to one point two x. but i mean do that tomorrow
of course something that with when you move your hand further the sound goes faster passes like fast ford
and then station
big around so my model is to get a piece of that

which is we go ahead and so there will be money sometimes we need the money and
have a short meeting people air every that's very interesting
the graphic which means with some provisions for cloak will form so if person
so if person said because instead of because then i put up an apostrophe at the beginning of the word and then and double wide like angle brackets what the full of school i would be in this could be
would be in this could be something it was handled by table or something but i think to have a
it's concern on it i mean it's internal until

good thank you david we've are your labeling machine hello
me some sort of cabinet
i can build a cabinet did
i can build a cabinet did the difficulty for this kind of project is the intellectual capital to design the cabin
the cabin know the words to figure things exactly what the right thing is that kevin can

be offended i think i suspect somebody's smoking about that did just
so we've done before i think i knew ship them up no we can do that i know what that do this
about that i think i knew ship them did just do this
and i don't know exactly how they recorded it but there's a lot
but there's a lot of different styles of speech and whatnot and they people

when's it going to be installed
if you tell me where it is finished the part of work already
so i just typist hypothetically assuming that we go ahead and get the using graduate students it who's
there's was a lot of overlapping
there's a lot of overlapping at the beginning overlapping

and then maybe also talk a little bit about some infrastructure and tools and so on you
transcriptionist so sometimes that's we're talking about
but other people are interested in for example stress marking and
stress marking and so jane is doing primary stress stretch marks as i'm
what happens is if you're transcriber listening to it sounds like and it just being a total in polite you'll see must do i thought it was you was no but you were

i wish it's a very thing
when no one is when we're not actually in the meeting and we're all sort of separated and doing things even during the in the beginning
and but i think a lot of them were because you were at the meeting and so
when you listen to in the context of you know he can't hear what are you saying
it was a lot funnier if you're there though i know

to adapt to speech recognition what i was thinking
to have they have several options so it's you know
to do damn but thing that though i feel definitely today
hire an infinite number of dance are was quite it was and there's always a warm-up thing
number of dance are we going to run out of disk and there's always a warm-up thing

one so that she can decide we don't need all this just the worst are fine
just the worst are fine circuits
i think it is what's going to happen
piece of that that people put with schools you slipped wires into that so shaped like a cross section i'm
not just leave them all i'm not i'm going up to them

we don't care about the time the words just to be odder and we don't because that was a pretty much no i that the boundary
we don't care about the time the words just to be odder and we don't because that was a pretty much no i that the boundary
because you can use the the tab key to toggle the sound on and off meal stops
part of it and if you want more details figure it out for yourself
but that's but does anyone time boundary full but it's because that's right

this is not something you need to ten meetings
their limits number speakers things
the user interface only last too and so
too and so if you are using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do too

it's very badly it's badly designed
is being recorded
i hands off her about a month ago
so that was the whole issue with the hilly d. that you plug it in you

you feel so good that way that's right that's what i have
have a short meeting people air every that's very interesting
meal stops sheesh if you press a tap and
that's a feature and then also

it was a glitch last time you're in
and see if it seems feels easier to you and forgetting all the words
variety so and then he has a script that will conversion to the thing that would indicate speak right
yes it is that's not what the question for eight they might

meetings as in which case will have to decide i caught so that we can give them a copy field
i was actually thinking i wouldn't mind spending the some
and i you mentioned mentioning your progress report status report that you had written a script to converted into so
the could be you know me at the beginning of the line and equal

fact get for free because their disturbing three l. b. c.
so that would be that would be something to look into so
the if we tried to do automatic speaker id because primarily bad but it does take twice
problems but some for this problem we can do about it why because

bit i think too said that they just the transcription format is really and simple in the discourse to maine but they also
so the do you just keep auction down
big screw that they've
and even though there's eight cables is not really very big around so

right this is the process of converting audio to text
but and we can get around it somehow you're
it's just user interface they didn't quite go the whole
see i thought behind which is that

seven several of them say that they'll do meetings and conferences and and so on none of though
so what they had is it's an easy task it cost twenty four dollars an hour and it will
an hour and it will take maybe five or six times real time and what they
and they're dash me up the opposite direction syndicate continuation of one's own daughter is versus

they're not going to provide they may
but would have talked to morgan about it i live out
we talked you need to do this and so you get very good at sort of jumping back and forth rather than hitting cabin back space in turned and or things like that
conversation could do that so much a clean any case

you know if you're trying to do or a member and say jet but i think for
with this be to document also for outside people are mainly for and now she
i think mostly internal
but what is internal me i mean you're leaving

thing is that kevin can go away would use
go away would use it for kindling or something
but if you can imagine what the right form factors that down i've
that down i've sort of gone around and this we're thinking about something opened up in the top to allow access to the mixer for example but there's this

tasting one two three tasting
and curriculum woman so says that
these six tables here with a little boxes that have been in the middle here which would

i'm getting lots of responses on different one size
on different one size of the various sorts easy in on this is a meeting about
of the various sorts easy in on this is a meeting about

you know he's doing digits
it wasn't a pure test the first time so
i think for first try that there so we hired a if we heard a whole bunch of bands that's i mean that's that because you don't the desegregation health and all the other

very heavily edited no chance of that
no are you recording or the table like a runaway you know chance
so we'll just be offended i think not

i've looked a little bit into commercial transcription services and jane
a bit of a problem because like i wasn't wearing a microphone and there are other
an hour and it takes about ten times real time i see

how do we and we just do all that infrastructure
and so it was only people who have web pages and are doing through that he thing think thing about
no i mean they would they were doing and they will fuse to transcribe this kind of material that's not what and then there's a problem also

right i think i mean for that particular issue there are known sources for people go to find these kind of things like the l. d. c. for instance
me l. d. c. and what does that mean to what we've done already right the it's not so much catch
it's not so much catch the logistics of distribution secondary to preparing to take a simple fourth description

it my friends and sometimes and different
and sometimes and then also i have a bunch of for doing this digits so i have
so i have a bunch of scripts with x. ways in some pearl scripts and other things that make it really easy to extract out an online where the digits are and if you'd

files pfizer x. m. l. or something with that and there's interest there's
and they people come in to a certain degree and they have that recorders
so it's sort of far afield

more do so we were playing to do like thirty or forty hours worth of meetings they want to do
they want to do an additional hundred or so hours so
especially for meetings i didn't use it very often

that's true and they're recording conditions are really clean i mean i've
so they were doing phone and so little transcription as as we're transcription
and so we're we decided early on that we were not going to do that i see

on it so maybe we need to think about it a little bit i think too said
but it would also maybe help be helpful for liz if she wanted to start work and some discourse issues you know looking at some of the state and then this is a very good purpose
for here but it was a big hassle right i mean

i mean so close that would be a meeting mimi
so my search was pretty cursory it was just in interesting
it was just in that search

undergrads to do it and that's happened in the past and
the past and i think that's probably the right way to do it it
i think would ever use these speech words we should always do this thing like you're talking about accent

we've run it through that's an interesting idea hey
do about it not because they why because they want a lot more detail
i mean the plane is going to generate the transcript with five tracks and it but would know what's some

that's true a couple of things first of all the time working you get you could get by tool and so that's
that's true and so if the issue really i'm thinking about that's interesting
and then also once you put a break and then you have the action cycling through the unit you could do it like multiple

be odder and we don't know actually we haven't decided which
we haven't decided which time we can around and
it's pretty easy one was if i could handle speaker unification is a big deal

i the question is how much time overly save us versus the time to write all the tools to do it right but the john if we talk got volumes
speaking anything police i like interact about that's good he goes
i see think in your life now that settled issue here is that i haven't really figure out a solution for this or it's not

and lower about as nynex sandwich waste of time
the first time so it's going to be an upper bound and in that case and
so anyway are we interested then in writing tools to try to generate in the automatically sets when you want

person would have to assign the boundaries and then what can they do for the next
the other person would have to that's easy enough i could do that we can say i see that they
i haven't tools that i like it's just as easy

did you talk to anybody does closed caption for t. v.
because they're usually at the end of the show they'll tell what the name of the company is caffeine companies doing it
not because they had and then had to speak it's right i mean

through that he thing think thing about this is thinking kind of maybe a little more globally then they should here but
should here but did really this could be a big contribution i could make
p. thing we know what it was like to manage the process and merely and

right and only talk when
only talk when you're pointed to
we talked about things like foot pedals and other lot so you things like that

i mean we can't tell them you know for this meeting we really want to mark stress in for this meeting we want
in for this meeting we want
and they're not going to provide stress they're knocking or

it so one of them is the idea of how to indicate speaker change
and this is the way which meshes it with a making it so that you know on that point such
know on that point such a interface when you get thee

options so it's you know i mentioned the looping option other option is it'll
and sometimes someone will do a back channel in the middle of it but you want to show
of it but you want to show that it's continued at a later point so

i should rewrite the mix tool to put half the people in one channel and
i've a auto gain mixer tool that mixes all the head now that microphones into one signal and
signal and that seems to work really for thee transcribers

right and also but they're format if you wanted to in indicated speakers right there instead of doing this and recruit then if they the winter comes up and it only allows to enter two speakers
but you're saying it but time you called back and an essay format it opens and when it was five speakers
it's just user interface they didn't quite go the whole

would ask you if you have a time estimate on the parts you transcribe you have a sense
which means to it each station
that's what people said that some chairs in the room

what a good idea that's how we could pay the transcription can have i want to introduce i want
i want to introduce the words not had into the conversation at this point you
at this point is because you my word it won't be recognized

don't @reject@
the my cousin close enough to your mouth so

the way it might be five
interact actually extra through did from plastic they sort of look like

i didn't bring my previous thing then
it's just to be the numbers on the back this channel

of look up her
and curriculum woman what else about this long rather than the projector so we put food on the table and so says that

can do that i know what that their full three you want four
but i think we should kind of position finish something shalala month

just to hang down make noise
and is it like especially about the bottom longest to try jerry frequencies that you may not already have recorded

services and jane has been working on doing transcription
answer on want to decide what we're going to do with that and

then get an update on the electronics
all the others have been on

in having it so susan using like all your d. v. d.'s or something like that
or something audio d. v. d.'s

you know the d. v. d.'s c.
right that's true no it's because he hasn't found any like the question

that we may want to make a little more formal
and the thing is that university of washington they want to stop recording meetings as in which case

you could accept this room
i touched defendants did you notice fan difference

i touched defendants on a lot
ten times about and this is like five times real time or ten times real time that's part city

it's enormous you want to leave off or not it's better
you know so that and i can label this one left right

this @reject@ i was learning also be ready was like any noise
the time just so drug meetings the dark with the air conditioning huge i

that unless they added the close feels later on but
those data night i can i was actually on the advisory board for when they said the project

because it would be to be able to take that and adapted to a meeting setting
no software but maybe it may be useful in how you mean mechanical adaptation or

that's not good right that's clean i mean i've heard i was intimidated sounds
that's not good right that's heard i was intimidated sounds

maybe i should get a copy of it just to see what they did so we i saw that it very
it might save ninety percent pretty much true but

they want to go and so we can compare very
can't remember any of the court this core c.

actually that's another thing i was thinking about is that maybe jane should talk to liz to see if there are any transcription issues related to discourse that she needs to get unmarked thing for her
you know there's also the these interfaces missing is that or

to see you know we need to talk to them some more
you know say this is what we're thinking about for our transcription if nothing else so talk to them some more

what we're using right now as a tool from this french group called transcriber that seems to work very
that seems to work very

for word levels so all also what you have to do is just identify segments of speech in time and then write down what was said within it and identify
technical documents twenty eight to thirty two dollars an hour who knows

mean we saw there was this presentation of the speech meetings about how
cheap to transcribe

that's part of the thing we're talking about so here
right so i think the gas at ten x. seems to be pretty standard

you know forty minutes to an hour
most of those are done really i'm thinking about the close caption you see running by on life newscast you know you

and then say morgan has consistently resisted telling me how much money we have right
money we have so right the answer zero there's

at any rate game was looking into the possibility of getting students that
right talking to people about that i'm afraid i haven't made any person

to my i haven't done
b. c. i. but at the same time doing kind of boot strapping a deciding transcription conventions that are no and like you know how much there's

because i know you get like to go spend five words that's easy
but then you have to take the time to market and

because i'm the words by sectors or whatever and
to visit it's so i mean i've been sort of playing with different ways of more because i think and you know i mean if you could get optimal instructions you could cut back on the number of hours it would take

most of those are done by person you know you i know i
anymore and transcript don't talk about

are those still plays just i think i'll be pretty smart at some we'll let you know good
are those still plays just we'll let you know good

see a lot of people who actually build human computer interface is understand that delay and
we could program that pretty did i mention and not in this case it has other

because primarily the markings right speaker change
but that would be but we've got a couple of shown playtime would have

knew you were going to do that
this upcoming

so a marker in that it's really transparent just a matter of
forty thieves done some portion of sneaking what's your plan yes

right so i'm not it's that much but anyway enough to work
so it's thirty dollars an i'm an ex factor through that

but keep the time markings
and then go through i mean and go through and try and re transcribe it given that we had perfect boundary detection and good idea

i could do that say that automatic millionaire you that they oracle boundaries would come from volume on a specific channel with me
have a short meeting people talking air every talk really fast it's going to really that's very interesting

and there are other people weren't making fun in sitting worthwhile anyway
set because it didn't matter if it was or you know versus

for hard technical using what using study
transcription use using stone age tools

they do a first pass speech recognition and
and then they do a clean up

hassle right i mean you know the they constantly reminding people going over and
over and clearly some new needs to be done here

and so on none of them specifically said that they would do speaker id or speaker change mark they all just the transcription they're they're maybe this
the way it worked is it was scale so what they had

in university atmosphere a little different things but
content words only go

say ten because easier they did not for engineering graduate
say ten because easier they did not for engineering graduate students

and that's what i said originally that i couldn't imagine sending and that's going to be cheaper no student there's another aspect too
it isn't fun the thing too is that if they were linguistics they'd be peace in terms of like the post editing topic content wise they might be easier to handle because they

they may or may not provide speaker id
so that we would have to do or and tools to do that so i just typist

channel so i think that's an unlikely to have happen
one part of it was funny everything was because it was a mixed signals so

or you could wire a mouse or track balls some it's not something i wanted to
a mouse or track balls some no it's not something i wanted to have that

how are you handling back channels
do you mean by that in my view when you've got a densely overlapping i didn't worry about specific start i'm just sort

but someone to was just the transcriber wouldn't of known that are that's true
only wouldn't be so if you plug in doesn't work and they will use off it's to tip off and then

to turn off your mike it he
was so he was checking the meter levels and we were

does it conversation come out from there are the person speaking for the long time as one segment and then there's this little tiny segment of this other speaker or does it does
or does it does the fact that there's a back channel split but the did too my focus

my focus was to try and maintain cotton caught content continuity and to keep it with within what he was saying like wednesday
he was saying like wednesday press groups but preside occur international groups as much as possible so

so i just always road as you
u. h. i mean like i said like five but in any case

i'll leave a mark see that's
i'll leave a mark i don't want them to see that's

i don't want them to be part of another outer it's so
it's so you just you need to have the boundary to start in the so and that's refinement

that the whole say form the safer from any internal format all that handles multiple speakers that just
than two so you're skips all's doesn't solve all our problems

i'm assuming it works
and it works i said because it's so quick dinner so i wouldn't want to do

the person i in terms of like the continuity of thought for transcription is just words coming out it's like
words coming out it's like there's some purpose for another in and sometimes

at a later point so i have a convention of putting like a dash arrow just to indicate that this person's that are letters continues and then when
and then when it catches back up again and this and they're dash me up

sometimes we had situation which is you know what you get in conversations of someone continuing someone else's outer edge and
and in that case it did it tilde arrow versus a arrow tilde to indicate that it was continuation but it wasn't like i said

you know at the end of this unit you know what happened later and that
happened later and that was like this person continued and you'd

if you were just recording someone's day it would be impossible you know if you're trying to do there's no
if you were just recording someone's there's no

equal i mean i this and do it i mean so
and i'd like to be able to support through you know there's detected conventions as you come up with and like that so i would

i couldn't lifting the tape into text file and trying to it was horrible
the thirty to ones what you got

think for first try that there so we hired a if we heard because you don't the desegregation health
think for first try that there so we hired a if we heard a whole bunch of bands that's because you don't the desegregation health and all the other

a few right so we can added links and like that to other things
a few right so we can added links and like

i own the project but i don't want
to do it no one wants to on the person

send me links i axis which would come
and i will send me pointers rather and don't

i'm not how important things are that i think
there's a looking in the stables

wasn't all that so we can put that one wanted to we don't we and for policing the thing
you trying the this is the table cross section of people realize that

the thing appointed to try and because harrington making a presentation right i agree it's true
little bit thinner and this is two by two buy one it would

not because then you don't have to just have one each other's to have to
not even a opinion and else right

do it certainly you could do a thing where all sixteen were plugged in
not if you get nothing else

i mean we i had that last time i thought they're attach things but
i thought they're attach it to you know the an extra that makes south on the radio receiver so

i was wrestling with his with literally built number of conductors in the cable and powering system and i've i was going
and i've i was going to do this very clever fan empowering decide

sketching out and i can certainly bills other a voc no problem with
a voc no problem with our you know our true

see jane see on channel four darn what i'm doing wrong

close enough to your mouth so it should be is

i try speaking loudly so like the high quality labeling that better hello

good thank you david we've are your labeling machine to improve the quality of labeling but hello

we don't want and find him please would you like to join the meeting i bet

on this meeting about were mainly being tape but we're going to talk about transcription for the future meeting meetings

it's not like minded you it's very good performance

i mean i would prefer that people weren't i mean

on their head but they were complaining about it

so this is that i says one i had before

so this is that i says one i had before

i believe the channel like friend number this microphone their own

i believe the channel blank their own

transferred number

you think that makes a difference god not me to

no but i'm going to look at the logs as

because before the meter as you said turn out the what

are and there was one hypothesis that perhaps that the active recording of the there was one of the things that contributed to the errors

the only reason that could be as if the driver has about

right because the machine just isn't very heavily edited no chance of that

that was that was a that was about it was a glitch

something shalala month on the tabletop

which means we need to move this thing and sorter decide how we're actually going to do things so they can put them

that's the point a lot easier if we have a have sometimes in place like that

i do wish they were big booms coming down from the ceiling

would it make you feel more important

i think whittle projector gets installed

i think while actually is almost getting pretty close to even getting ready to put out the purchase order

corpus and i think it's going to be generally useful it seems

d.'s

and so how do we distribute the transcript i we distribute

i we distribute the audio files how do we

as it is it's sort of ad hoc combination of and up and i set up that we

and if you'd obvious going to do the same thing i think it's worthwhile for them to do these digits tasks as

and what i've done is pretty at hawk

so we might want to change it over something a little more stand

you know a scam files pfizer x. m. l. or something with that and there's interest there's

or something with that there's interest up there

they certainly wanted to collect more data and

and so they're applying i think i'd be i'm

or so hours so they want very large state is

i would like that just to get a destroyed speaker satin and destroying room

it's enormous that's great you that's better it's

stance wired backwards by the weight

i think this is high speed here

what's it was like but it was mid scale of it but clear maybe just

what's it was like but it was clear maybe just

they're very good carbon monoxide poisoning you know would really mean that we should do short meeting throughout the air conditioning they don't make noise

actually that they're fishing so working it's just a jewellery fan

in addition to this issue about the u. w. there was announced today view the l. d. c. corpus from i believe santa barbara i thought

of i've been watching for that purpose

of general spoken english

but i've listened to some of those data night

i wish it sounds like i'm glad to see that i got really so it's a very

i wish we had some once you're working on adaptation because it would be to thing

in doing some of her first automatic speech recognition models it may be useful to have that kind of data because that's very

that's true of data because that's very different than any kind of data that we have so far and they're

no we can @reject@ no wonder what their webpage and answered either so i'm too

either so i'm i was thinking that we should contact them so it's sort

them so it's sort of the beside the point but

it's really do i think too it's temperament

it's really do unless we're going to someone to work on it so maybe we need it's temperament

maybe i should maybe massive i saw that it

any of the court this core c. s. a. e. corpus

all of spoken american english

maybe we should have a big meaning

maybe should it fine sunday that lives i live in seemed to be around more often

is going to be here and we can meet at least

we can meet at least elisa sub group i mean

i was even thinking elisa sub group i mean not necessarily have d. u. dub people now

so so we move on talk a little about transcription transcriptionist

right so we're at this point only looking for word levels

it and identify the speaker

and it's a little bit deceptive if you go that different protecting pre repair part

sometimes surfs the middle anyway

the middle anyway so i was doing was bracket and them to indicate that they were repairs which isn't

thing we're talking about so what we wanted to do is have jane do one meetings worth

is and so one of the things was to get an estimate of how long it would take and also

take and also what tools we use and so the next

right so one of one option right i would hear about these used to be a big ears continue maybe transcription conventions hurst

it will require a post pass i mean

but i just can't imagine that we're going to get anything that much better from a commercial one and the commercial

and the commercial once i'm will be much more expensive could joy to do at all

we'll just get joy n. j. that was for it

you know that's what we're talking about is getting some slaves who need money and

i can talk i detected that character's

i can talk i detected that character's

we're we job man

mean i can't imagine us doing it ourselves @reject@ we

right it but you could not do anything until we get money is ridiculous but i can do it

do it so it until you actually have a little experience with what this french thing does we don't even have and i do

she's already done quite a bit i'm have a bunch of

she's already done quite a bit i'm so that's have a bunch of hours

time to market and then there's the issue of it's easier to here at the right the first time if you've marketed the boundary instead of somewhere in the middle because i'm the words

but the recognition quality is going to be horrendous

we don't care about the time the words just to because he's just that said that was a pretty much no i that the boundary

so then you listen to a second time and move over here

and so when you find time you click it'll be right on because it'll go back in time but

miss mister t. c. l. i would've thought so interesting pull interesting

interesting point

the if we tried to do automatic speaker id bad but it does take twice

i the question got volumes

all the tools to do it but we're going to leave but the john if we talk recollecting ten or a hundred dollars which is going to take a hundred thousand oaks transcribed @reject@ if you think of from ten extra five actually

so knew you were going to do that think

i mean it's it's maybe like a week as to get to do something like this forty or fifty

forty or fifty alice did

did you get it so that would so it would detect volume on a channel and insert a marker in

just a matter of a very clear is x. m. l. isn't

so very i mean i to pay the final four it's just it has a time indication and then something or other and then and time or something or other

she's already in the past she's someone you already done so yes i have

she's done about half a meeting she's someone she's one right you already done so i see yes i have

she's done about half a meeting she's someone she's one you already done so yes i have

done about half a meeting she's one right i see

and then that would just need some statistics two or three more there's a plan

i bet there's an extra promises that i didn't really keep accurate it wasn't a pure test

one person would have to assign the boundaries and then the other person would have to that's easy enough the boundaries we can what can they do for the next i see

know how i mean the question is it worth giving you the second patient i see

time yourself on it so a little double blind here kind of i see

is it probably like expensive microphone i mean that's a beach

i've already become pretty familiar with the format or be so great

using stone age tools i mean i look it's true

the process and merely might look for more detailed we're looking for here but

include me at all

i mean i don't know if we'd be able to things to help the t. p. type problems but some

speak it's right i mean the excitement the problem is

they had two speakers over the telephone too i see so what took him so

so what took him so long

mostly because they were doing much lower level time

an hour i think that's the ballpark there were several different

there were several different companies that and they're the range was very tight for technical documents twenty

they want will have to mix they went over so if it's no i mean channel and then there's a problem also

no i mean they would they were doing and then there's a problem also

all just the transcription they're maybe this multiplier for five

speaker change mark they all just the transcription they're they're maybe this multiplier for five people cost twice as much for ten people got something like that

and what they said is for the hardest tasks bad acoustics sticks meeting settings it's thirty two dollars an hour and it takes about ten

so a lot of companies i work for you the the person leading the meeting the detected or whatever to go rent room and mentally calculate how many dollars per hour this meeting is costing in

and say so here we're thing let's see if he goes another hour it's going to

and clearly were talk slowly but with few words

because until a graphic meetings it might be interesting

cheap to transcribe

today right so we have a ball park on how much it would cost if we send it out

thirty or forty we're talking about depicting how many hours with means

hundred dollars an hour so three hundred i'm an ex factor

rate but we can pay a graduate student seven dollars an hour

that's and the question is what's the difference or

that's how much i don't think difference or eight dollars would do you know what the going rate it's

that's how much i don't think difference or eight dollars would

but think that would say is a good estimate

let's i was going to say you'd say ten

i do the linguistics grad students i

it i don't know at the where there is a standard pay scale i just don't know what it is that's right

and that's what i said so that means that even if it takes in thirty times realtime it's cheaper too to do graduate student and there's another aspect

and that's what i said originally that i couldn't to do graduate student and there's another aspect too

and also we would have control of me we could give them feedback whereas

them feedback whereas if we do a service it's going to be limited amount i mean we can't

stress they're knocking or provide repairs they're not going to provide

students it who's the person in charge who's going to be steve

i in charge who's going to be steve here

now what this involves some minor of monetary compensation or would

i would imagine there compensation or would it be the voluntary coordinator of multiple transcribers

i would imagine there would be some the terry involved but would have talked

of that unspoken they just mean just work today

should have been i don't know looking for too

nothing morgan though

@reject@ and be and say would you like fries with that your pay scale i see good

more not that i would be interested in that in becoming involved in the project so it's like that more

so as far as i'm concerned those transcription conventions or fix right now

you when you get thee you get to see signal you also get down beneath it an indication of if you have two speakers

if you have two speakers overlapping in this in a single segment you see them want display one above each other and

thing you can clip click on individual orders is in it'll take you meet lead to that part of speech signal play for you and

but my script can handle any and

can handle any and they're save format can handle any

and they're they've been quite responsive i've been exchanging

responsive i've been exchanging emails on various issues he asked him to change

issues yes and they said that's he asked him to change interface more speakers

yes and they said that's on in the works for the next version also multi channel

they said they wanted to do it but that the code is really very organized around single channel so i think that's

you know what they're using it for what the development

for this exact task for transcription but or the linguistics but

because he l. d. c. has been advising them on this process linguistic

it's also all the sources available

if you speak t. c. l. t. k.

do any development i said maybe

so you have when you play it back if it is useful to have a break mark to six i mean but you wouldn't be strictly necessary

you wouldn't be strictly necessary because you can use

interfaces missing is missing from all of our offices medicine some sort

medicine some sort of like and put for something like that so what

like that so what are you people actually use of course something that with

you know like a joystick or

i just don't know how much it's worth doing and just going i agree

and just going to have i agree they have several

other option is it'll cost me reaches into the boundary

that they thought about and also it will go around of the

i want to say cursor but i'm not if it's the right thing

anyway you can so they thought about different ways of having windows that you i work with that

and but so in terms of the the conventions then strictly or the graphic which means

but i think to have a convention marking it as a non standard or what economy kind of i'm a non worth of course the graphic whatever going

how are you know same thing and there'd be limit how much refinement you want indicating something is not cruz

anyway time getting the person no know have the it immediate

in the middle of it great that happens very seldom

this is overlapping murder and if there was a word like right you know then i would indicate that it happen with the same temper timeframe but wouldn't say exactly

i transcribed a minute of this and that was a lot of overlapping

that was a lot of overlapping was a lot of

tell me jane had cats comments like too who the person was speaking to only one it was

and we were handling things he was labeling that whatever was that

but or it wasn't in some quite everybody we know what we it

but no but you were asking off the wall questions

but if you knew that i wasn't actually in the room and that and wasn't talking to me it became and that's

a comments the rest of the time i didn't bother with who's talking to but

so this is going to go in the meeting transcriber talking to but this is unusual there's sickness

a mixed signals so you couldn't get any clues from volume that you know he was really far away from this conversation

i thought it would be you know i didn't want to add more contextual comes or needed that they seem to be clarified

that they seem to be clarified that be caught what was going

so i was just going so normalization

i was just going to has it so but i just wanted to finish off the question i had about back channel but that's

which was so say somebody talking for a while and

for a while and sort of because i'm in the middle of it and whatnot

and so then in terms of like words like and i just wrote them because i figured

and i keep him too limited set because it didn't

it seems like and that's refinement that maybe it could be handled by part of the script or something

it seems like the transit transcription problem would be very different if we had these welcome not sick speaking of detection and placing things

because suddenly i mean i

as you want it's just that it was what if you want to edit right

it was what if you want to edit right

what's some and that's kind of type in the it's

and it can be edited after the fact and also but

solve all our problems we're always going to want to go through this preprocessing i'm assuming

i see so i wouldn't want to do it through interface anyway i think which right with the speaker was

yes i wanted to have so

wanted to have so sometimes the person i in

but it wasn't like i said equal arrow for this for the tone for yourself things because it's

things because it's speakers the same

and then tell there if it was a different if a different speaker continuation but as you know there is

if it was a different if a different

but as you know there is showing continuation of and bought

but continued and you'd be able to look for the continuation

but i think for meetings it's pro

but a lot of these issues i think that for from my point of view where i just want to do speech recognition and information retrieval it doesn't really matter

interest but it does feel like i feel like it's i mean it's i you know this

mean it's i you know this but it's description and

you wanted to indicate that it i this is the end of the phrase that's the end of

it i mean so i thought about it and read and it didn't

and read and it didn't do it and doing ten times the

i to me transcribe you have a sense of how long

i to me often and out transfer minute but i didn't have any of how long

a transcribers around i couldn't

to this new upper limit

we sell banner ads it would be interesting to see

we sell banner ads to see

is because exactly recognized

i wouldn't tell me i'm no there i

i wouldn't tell me i

now want to raise the issue

conventions as you come up with and like that so i would

like that so i would like to see that kind of on the web no

on the web no ideal tries to website would be putting doctor speech

i'll he committed himself to something

i know but that up but i job of it he should be allowed to you know do it

right but i should be allowed to but

we have quite a disparate number so definitely should we should have some kind of access at the time

we have quite a disparate number of wet and other sorts of documents on this project sort spread around i have at the time

try to consolidate

try to consolidate me who wants to do that

me who wants to do that though

no one is we could like we can my certainly disorganized sort of group fish golf what's issue

we could like we can my certainly disorganized what's issue

no one is group fish golf

i one and the project

they have to do the website you know it's like @reject@ but

you know it's like @reject@ but what

you know it's like @reject@ but what

hack you're talking about writing h. t. m. l. right

and i'm talking about putting together all the data in the form that is legit bull unpleasant to read and up to date and et cetera so but it against a lot of actually as a tool

et cetera so it against a lot of actually as a tool to help your job goes here

i like it's just as easy as to edit the you know as anything

right that's true any like the question is what to you look at which ones he used

at usually which ones he used to

i if i were doing more powerful excuse me more complex web site that might want to it's very powerful site maps

i if i were doing more powerful it's very powerful site maps

most of the website that you weren't that complex

concern on the project internal until i

send me links i see we could do in each axis which would come

i was in tunnel definitely don't have to make a very good but you i

because he got the word is work sooner or later it's true is benefits to that's

because he got the word is work sooner or later is benefits to that's right i mean it's

even if it's just writing things up the early on

i was looking for the actual box i plan to use

it just there another about what the by two buy one it would fit right into the field the lip there's a looking in the

it just there another about what the into the field the lip there's a looking in the

but this was just review what else about this long rather

woman that being a diagram

that's the six tables were looking at these six tables

plenty of data

welcome come next meeting and

your paper off my p. d. a. and they tell you this is boxer let

the box that a half inch lip the boxes

inch lip the boxes in six

in the front and a little l. e. d. indicates that boxer's life that they important

that they important issue about the l. e. d. is the fact that we're talking about eight of these total which to be sixteen channels and

and even though we have sixty channels back at the capture they're not all to be used for this so there should be a

only wouldn't be so if you plug in doesn't work

and then the would wire though all the cables in a bundle come through here in collect these cables at the same time so this

it's like going down looks like a my circle

it's like a complacent a my circle

speaking anything police i like about that's good he goes

that's really cruel

so why do could go either way go to the diagonal here

that some chairs in the room i'm just saying that for the

i didn't understand @reject@ this box did being the wiring box

i didn't understand @reject@ this box did being the wiring box

and it's function is just to essentially a wire converter to go from these little wires these black white

plus supply power to microphones because the

@reject@ i would i the simplest thing

but they're these it cables and lawyers

you know what happens if somebody unplug this because they plug in more something else

right i mean we the there will be a certain amount of looking at cables has to be done if people everywhere things but

attracted the full i did have from the mexican caught pretty good for a question of tobacco the really works in got that's fifth

and their work didn't sound good of tobacco and they were not that it great

it's that's wonderful that's amazing

so what's the scheduling and things but you always so

but there's this thing sticking out of the mixer which are kind of a pain so you end up

i understand that think that you can start sketching out and

a desk at home
