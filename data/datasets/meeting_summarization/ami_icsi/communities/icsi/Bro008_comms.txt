it looks like the overall result as a are now even without you know any bugs being fixed is that on the other tasks we had this average of forty nine percent or so improvement and
there's a couple pieces to it to suspect
so everything we did to probably just be added onto what how could tell bitten probably
is not usable right
no and that the training i is always done on the coast talking
i chitty doing much condition it's great it's quite difficult i mean it's
i mean it's they have all these states affirmed close mike confirmed this i nike from the from driving conditions opening though close window
and they take all of these
percent of testing so training he's dumb different conditions and different microphones and testing
so and it does correspond to realistic situation in the sense that people might really be trying to call telephone numbers or something like that in their cars and they're
and they the matched condition is what she might imagine that you might be able to approach if you know that this is the application you're going to record a bunch
because we change we some want to stay in it doesn't work out
work out for good to something i don't know it goes
and so then we would just stop it

you know most of the time even i mean even though it's true that the overall number for danish we didn't improve it
because he nickleby over there telling people but we did so he
i mean even with these results as they are it's it's really not that bad but
i mean i think that one of the things that he was talking about was understanding what was in the other really proposals and
and trying to see if what should also be proposed to some a combination of things
to it to suspect this attraction southeast is you know wiener filter
they are so since we have a bit farther to travel and some of the others to get done a little quicker but
i mean i think the question is there some advantage i mean you could just take
i mean you could just take the best system and say that's the standard but the thing
because so me and told me that we're trying authority to put some kind of the training and so that's that's what the idea l. d. s. that they could
but the i mean the have to mystical and is
welders an m. s. g. like finger was an m. s. g. right
as we were just talking about some work that we're interested in

so i got these yourselves from stefan also
also i think that we might hear later today about other itself think
we have a little bit of time on that actually
and here we have so much better than that in a danish and so worse than that on the german but i
did anybody do anything with the models is an experiment or
so as a result of that we have reduced transmission rate for the pets
that was mister porter the first time out it said the same
view on it so you know the real things probably somewhere in between the two

so but you can't i mean you got to doing speech and enduring simon's
they're using because these standards are supposed to go on cellphones with moderate resources in both respects
but the thing is that if different systems are getting it good things began within the constraints of the resources if there's something simple that you can do
a friend since it's i think very reasonable to have a standard for the terminal side and then for the server side say here's a number of things that can be done
and so and they both had some kind of on my normalization right
or swords so
so it seems like the main difference there is the as the filtering
and the filtering i think if you can

three work it better and one market towards
actually voted any stairs to some kind of military
because when me you was the street teachers we i'm not able to get these number with
and they're not things that we did precisely we did
but the only katie at that is that everybody's being real conscious of how much memory and how much c. p. u. they're using because
so i think that you know this is this is a neat data set
i mean are much better than they were you know talking

it i'm going to have a little time on that in actually so
you know so my impression is they also did very on the evaluation set but
bitten probably work pretty with them too so
so it seems like the right thing to do is to on the terminal side take what they did if it does seem to generalize two german and danish
i'll take what they did and a filter and then and some on the server side and
and that's probably a reasonable standard
rerun it other than that you're done right

but you know so too is comparatively later but
so there are two more so we're going to end up with the same kind of sheets that has the percentages and so i'm just for the
be something to discussing the meaning
but not clear what will go on
and then when you sell it to somebody they will be a different person with a different car and so on so
goes maybe do that there's so that the age in it and and they have them

eighteen nine forty four
so hold off on that a little bit i mean even with
i think the meeting is on the thirteenth or something
so i'd be interested in hearing your sucks now i mean you're
and for about that he there is so much more became cassius arrows on my speech

eighteen nine forty four
and another they didn't report it if they did
i think everybody was focused elsewhere
one of the things that's about what we did is we do have a filtering which leads to a production in the band was in much relation spectrum which allows us to down samples so

so i think in this community that's of interest it's not like
and they might just say they just don't know enough yet to declare standard
and if we can back off from this now and sort of take our time with something that have doing things quickly be quite so much to constrain what do you think would be the best thing to do
have to mystical and is

but first so three ever look at the speech from the that the basis because we tried
because we tried everything but
everything but we can treated that's what's happening
or more generally i what is causing the degradation

i mean always of course even with all of our wonderful processing still are horrible kinds of numbers
sort of one try rights took one filter that they're right and it
right and it seems to me that if that is an important idea which it might be that one could work at it for awhile as you saying
and you had you know you had the multi band things also and you know there's an issue with that

but they in one was called french telecom elk tell system it was called up and tell francetelecom still kind of system what's the biggest difference i think but there
then that's a standard
it's just that if you just disobey and then you risk not being able to sell your product or

and they use the main thing that they use to spectra subtraction or
that but this process has gone on for awhile and already and
lot of times it's true there are a lot of times when we try something and it didn't work right away you know we had an intuition that there should be something there

it's shit i it's the same shit
so i see so yes the high so
so yes the high so the rest of the highly mismatched case is in some sense of good model for what we've been you know typically talking about only talking about additives noise and

you you'll be you'll become experts on this and number for more than me about this that this particular standards process once you go to this meeting
that's gotten terrible results by taking some data day and artificially in oak involving it with some response or something we take a very
one point brian and i went downstairs into the basement is in a hallway we're is very refer brent and we

because a lot of times it's true there
but it was you know sort of a small improvement and
and it was in the big attic complications so you dropped it

phyllis out to after actually so
and also part of what's about this is that this is he realistic almost realistic database i mean

results from other places
out in second place second thing is that the only results we have so far before really developments that yourself

and then diet seven up this email about because he has been running some other systems other
work that way that's you know that's sort of the donna things even

and you know it when whenever anybody figures it out they should also for you mail he because he
kind of numbers were getting there about eight or nine percent error for digit

somewhere and they're depending on exactly
in here the worst system still reduce their race by thirty three percent or something so it's so

how much better was that best system than ours so
day after they leave but lost have to stop at the day before

but foresee developments that our best result was a little bit shorter fifty percent and the best result
and the best result of any system and fifty four where

it's so you know so everybody is doing things between roughly thirty years and the errors being eliminated and bearing on different s. and so forth so i think
but live in the artificial setup it isn't noise artificially you know simulated it's it's real

of the they were two systems that were put forth by combination of francetelecom and now could tell and
i think but there are some other differences too

but i we haven't seen if you haven't seen
the training and so that's that's what

and they if you haven't seen any find ourselves
just was a missing columns something

precisely we did unreasonable things which because they like to try strange things and
strange things and and how things work too

so in reality if you put this the system and into the field it would be twenty four hundred bits per second i'm forty eight so
it's very short

what is the development set i mean the to set results do
like the day before you leave or something probably the

d. b. results or do like the day before the meeting or something
so i think the whole reason for having as long as we have which is like a week and a half is just because of bugs like that

has something to do with the electricity shortage
we didn't we don't have enough electronics here and

so there are two more comes the shit so i'm just for the i it's the same
and so on so it's not final even if they declared standards and they might

saw this i just figured these numbers that's
these numbers that's that's good

shouldn't take a lot of memory to do that and i also wouldn't think the c. p. u. would be much either for that part so if you can if
so if you can add those in then you can cut the data right now

they are working on disability
database i mean still not people who are really trying to accomplish something but

your product or
i mean if you have ten digits for protecting every now and then you get right i mean

interested in hearing
no accepted because we change

almost done i mean you're done in the sense that you maybe you'll get some new features some snow and little rerun it
so it's an interesting hearing your thoughts about where you think we should go from this i mean i tried a lot

so there's this demi snatch is the same kind of thing but so that the
of thing but it driving conditions i mean the speed and kind of froze it different for training and testing is that right

and they're trying to connect to something
hi katie it's varicose to topeka speech training goes because the clothes microphone and speech testing

of inspired by the by very so learning articulate tory feature and i think in the case paper dishonor it's based on multi band information where you have a combination grady and learning and
than they were you know talking about thirty to sixty percent error rate reduction this it's really great

so there's a lot of things to work with
what i like about it you know way is that the results are still so terrible

other itself think that there are some other very good results that unlike compared to

systems other than the c. o. john one so

but it looks like

if you look at it individually weathered really say is that there's looks

looks like out of the six cases between the different kinds of matching conditions out of the six cases there's couple where it stays about the same

we don't have just ninety three seventy eight we eighteen nine

so that's probably something wrong with the features that we get from which she i

and he's working on trying to check it i'm going to have a little time

when you cook leave

so saturdays midnight or something

of time

the german but i mean it sounds like one way or another the methods that were doing ten reduce the error rate from elk upstream four seven to i half of them somewhere and they're depending

we don't know yet

me first place there's still this thing to work out in second

it's not like everything is being pinned on the evaluation's set

where these numbers are the relative reduction and we're there right

and the others just in this we're somewhat lower than that there was actually

that there was actually it was much less of a huge range than there was in her one or are one

one or are one there were systems that didn't improve things in here

it's probably a good time to look at what's really going on and see if there's a way to combine the best ideas swell

swell same time not blowing up the amount of resources used because that's

used because that's critical for this test

about who's was it that had the lowest on the does that

and they differed in some respects but they in

i actually something and then there was some modification of the capsule parameters

actually something that's close to i mean subtraction

but the weight i mean he's adapted cigna depend

but it's very close to two concerning subtraction but some people have

but some people have done exactly that sort of thing of

of thing of i mean it's not to look in speech only try to measure these things during speeches but that's not that

but that's not that uncommon

but it still looks like he did some reasonable things

it's possible that some combination of these different things that were done would be the best thing to do

it said the same amount because for convenience sake in a particular way this is being tested they were repeating the packets so

the packets so it was so they were they had twenty four i bits per second but they were literally creating forty eight hundred bits per second even though it was just repeated

right they could have had a repeat counting there or something so in practice

they could have had a repeat counting there or something in practice

i mean this is just a phony thing just to fit into the software that was testing errors channel areas and so on so

so that's a feature of what we did

but we still have to see how it all comes out

what is and then there's the whole standards process which is another thing altogether

probably the day after they leave but

but i mean it's just chasing down these bugs i mean just exactly the

i mean just exactly the sort of thing that you know why these teachers seemed to be behaving differently in california than in oregon

i think you know the main reason for having you

having you know it takes to run the two test that's interesting computer time is just a day or so right so

so he neckers tried to push for trying to combine different things so

that's one aspect of it and then on

and then on terminal side i don't know how much memory and c. p. it takes but it seems like the filtering mean the v. a. d.

are working on disability because so

that's what the idea l. d. s. that they could you know they could actually show that in fact a combination of some sort would work even better than what and in is

on i mean on the one hand sometimes people are just anxious to get a standard out there and you can always have another

there and you can always have another standard after that but

and already and people might just want to pick something and say this is it and

standards are always optional it's just that

and people often work on new standards on old standards in place and so on so it's

i mean you're almost done i mean you're

this i mean i tried a lot of things in a hurry and

it's a novel idea look

idea look at the data

actually there's something that most of t. r. us we can funding classes

taking it could be interesting to see i don't think it's too true when we had knowledge in

in so we i the confusion make the confusion matrix is a very different in an is now he's in when it's can speech

so it perhaps we could have large king it just by looking at improving and re commissioned nothing funniness with the funny because he simply

which is the same pair program perhaps but which is perhaps important for my speech

think strikes me just looking at these numbers is just taking the best cases i mean

just take the best case the matched german case after are matched danish after we

it's it's real condition

and they take seventy percent i think for training and thirty percent of testing

microphones and testing also is dumb on different microphone and conditions so

conditions so probably we only take the close microphones i the research should be much better and

excise partially

and that's condition is microphone for crane and done for this thing

you're going to record a bunch of people in cars and so forth and training

and so on so it's this is in opting somewhat optimistic view on it

things even say on the development set that we saw the the numbers that how could tell was getting which is you know the best and the numbers it just it wasn't good enough for real system

so looking at today they were you know what's what's what's characteristic it

characteristic it i think that's good

even thoughts about what else you're thinking that you didn't get too you would like to do if you had more time

sweet thing and it those seen

and we've doesn't look we to most these maybe

these maybe the chinese game we've got to go to a few to no accepted

i don't know accepting who's seeing what we i pools

and one of the things i don't remember the details on but i remember at some point when you were working with the second streaming you tried they'll pass filtering the caps term in some case you got welders

caps term in some case you got welders an m. s. g. like finger was an m. s. g. right

you i think in some case you got some little improvement but it was you know sort

but that was just sort of one try rights

is going to be continuing working multi band things as we were just

and then you mentioned before also have the new digit set coming up from recordings in this room

this it's really great that to do that in a relatively short time

but even after that it's still so poor that no one could really use it
