right some i should read all of these numbers
i mean you've ridden didn't even in what seems to be quiet like what it's just
so here's if that's permissible and i'm happy
spent money and of the update of that you have to be essentially startled to the belief that
and then what you're going to need is four things it influences with
with what seats doesn't want anything
what you want and what particular one of the after the first
means the same as in point the snow as and poured
one which we change that just rename that
one which we change that just rename that
i ask about version that's i don't think what we would currently do
why it like they're either true or false and the president
that is for certain purposes it becomes important but
we get if we yes so if visit just merging those for just to take event points decision
so if i maybe more than then point decision so the idea
point decision so the idea would be that you might want to merge those three this
from another point of view of course it's interesting it's important know what it's selling for servicing and so forth so
forth so for this decision it's just tour falls
and it is a case where they were seems just what you want
are more likely dinner so you just want to have them
decision so that's like a new that
like you have to be in move mode before
that's true finish ascended
and it would affect
but it that's but i can't see why anything everything in the model wouldn't be
this is good discussion we're going to have to
have to get it down to something which was it self relatively compacts so could
his energy it does it just seems like a push the problem back a level but no
but it just adventures what
it just adventures what is the technical one that you don't want up with such big exponentially c. taste the
that's tired fresh and
worth it to use user fatigue even
what we're talking about is compatibility
but the thought those end up regretting right now know your compatibility to the current action right
into your world we're going to want to know you know which constructions indicates various of these properties
and so again that's to do correct we have the use of much
we have the use of much of the situation motive here we don't tend to discourse
here we don't tend to discourse my here yet but just see ways
right so this was sort of push it in one direction whenever
whenever people also sometimes say how do i get there in order to find out
interesting so what buster said which is completely right is if you know that they're only going to do it then it doesn't matter whether it's close to not in terms
you know there's different things the strikes and that the like situation traffic and so on
the strikes and that the like situation traffic and so on
worry about the layout amenable but will go nuts but
of should we make a key know here comes
i in parts of d. isn't if you want to make it consistent
the right way to have it where go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of don't know about each other but they both need to go their decision because i think so
their decision because isn't and they i mean i think so

do was you who it'll spend at least part of the time trying to build the influence links you know which
you know which sets of things are relevant to which decisions
and actually i had specifics justin to start first with the past ones
decisions there we wanted to keep server running toward
but here i wasn't what to ride in
and doesn't have a lazy mode
or just accidentally erased this i just
it's true or false
what so you those is true or false
not objects we called them entities right
be cries what we're going to want is an intermediate thing which is
yes i like even like that opportunity
bentley this third idea of input from the discourse
use a thrift caesar true finish ascended richard they use their interests
planner what's a good one that's this
i don't yet know how to do this i
this i we're going to wined up pulling out discourse properties like we have object properties and we don't know what they are yet
i what would just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a place holder for we
holder for we are side discourse features of course for the end points
for go there probably is and here discourse
it can have their various values
to they're all sorts of ways of breaking it up so that there isn't
but this is and this is like this is coming from over here
that's all good i'm just and we conducted but the good thing is we over here
and we conducted but the good thing is we could have people believe provocation which i love
so anyway so that's another decision
comes from keith
my current kermit idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it
and the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things you know given
right right i think trying to formulate the conditional question that sounds too much
before we get more into details
but you know it's for the fourth

so this is not just displayed this is actually
this i just had values shows such as she's we had an hour and this we had she's staying in a hotel you staying
we did and then of course we had the fact that given the fact that he's thrifty and there would be admission never get all these cross
why it like they're either true or false the president
that's that some unless like the you
that's that seems to be so unless like the you
et cetera that had to be certain properties that would fit in into the decision that
seems to me that we sort of it in bought it about and embedded a lot of these things we had and they're pretty risky and some of the other final decisions on here for example
don't have deviate values if we have
just for starters and here
not really important not to have lupus spouse away
the discourse is a mystery first one so just make some
there's parking maybe
like by the time he graduates
no and for you we can handle

we are just because they're nancy still stay nazi and they were but not too
the database ones being in some sense less interesting to us although probably have
although probably have to be done
of all this i knew from this has to be there right
that the property it but the question is do you want to propagates movies every single time it's updated ernie when we need to
that's a good question
less likely to and you know possibly
and again it's the heart of the i outer controlling conditioning of this thing those would be set so that some
that's right so the employ no right
we'll have to decide us and then what's the discuss history give us
but that's what would be but that know we only have at the most four at the moment i rose going from each of the but some decisions

a hotel you staying with friends and so
@reject@ unless see was values are things i
he friend today and we may change on
so and we assume that some of these properties would come in directly through unintelligible bentley this
so you could you let me give you two ways to handle that all right
you could have x. a. fifty note and
you've got us and all of this of the decisions
about the grand canyon right now and i
almost by definition paying involves entering get going
and everything would be clean they could do it again

which where you end up at the end but the part the good part
change design to design we had was there was a
was there was a decision with the same three outcomes based on just those three separate considerations
so we wanted to do that would have to put in three intermediate nodes every daughter kept it very simple
so here's what it looks like to me
is that you wanted intermediate structure which is essentially the order of for this purpose of selling fixing or servicing so
so i made it but is it the kind
right as related from the user model
seems like everything in using model would contribute to whether or not these are was compatible with something
we'll have to decide that's

so it's you know a current furniture and so forth and so on or not at all right
that if any of those things is true then it's the kind of place that you
no it's inundated together it intermediate no that's
things can be generally and then and be accessible
and i said let go inside
which is the get rid of that @reject@ long link between who the user and the end point they're just
the question that it's
use interests and the user who what the user is completely apart from the fact whether he is tired broke
we'll have to decide how much of it where that goes and give us that's true things

different things you could do you could have all those values forego there or you to
do this right while the you was there was that's it the more like aid to interest you said no co what i teach of
again for this purpose i think it's commercial someplace
you want to go in to do some kind of business
so this is sort of some extra little thing that takes all the discourse and
there other situational things that do matter or something right
i said just having one situation and the you know not you know because
so that no i mean go there's ass no it would just be advised by separate ones for be

so let's start with thee believe that's general influence and then
because you know it might be easy to figure out that this person's going to need more film eventually from their and spot it's
spot it's much more complex to a query when would be the most appropriate time
what is mentioned before
not i mean that's the issue is would
again with the layout at some point
i they tell you goes this is sort of

it's clear where what where we are right now
three about three for now
you have a know that's that was a measure of the match between the objects feature you know the match between the object again today i'm and the user so
next which is if that's true how do we want to combine that's
i mean it's and i don't think it's going to be i don't think it'll get worse that by the way so that's
a that's a good but before did we decide to on these it to a false so it's

no i mean if you go to every you know to go to prague or whatever your key points that you have to do is across the charles bridge
we did but the three things that the that it contributed this
that's the part of the idea is and this is that the
i mean in terms of entertainment
in point and put business
it's a under bar you

and let's see if we can get it linked up just to get ourselves started
for go there probably is truant officer
but if you talk to him a bunch of then you would ask them do you want to go but i think
separate things it could be that the discourse gadget it's self integration is which
that you'd have to do you got to do reference and like that you've got to have both the current discourse in the context to say i want to go back there when i was
but this picture that's emerging here just to my wish that you notice ready for some a tree or is it that we

particular so the ones we talked about were exhibiting and selling accessible
accessible the too
so that's rename this
no not levels of interest interesting
levels of interest interesting things you can be interested in
and discourse is something that sort of should we make

nancy still stay and they were but not
time to take a picture of the outside it seems like everything is a model effects
so me suggest we switched to another one i mean police
one i mean police more work to be done on this but things be more instructive
so keep this is going to get into your world

all the great that's tough
influence and then we'll also at some point break and talk about the techie
or but for the moment this is just a no that is conditioned externally and might influence various things
go there and because it's there's open or not
but that no that's kind of

not so what right true given not friends whereas the castle the decision is this person went to go there or is it just
seems to be so to do is get this down to what we think is actually likely to be a strong influence
put them in but we're going to want to do is actually this is one of my problems
like for anything you eat in it
do i have time to go in and climb all the way to the top of the curtain on film or do i just have to time to take a picture of the outside it seems like everything is a model all

and so that's a decision would be do we want and that
and also if it's an expensive place to enter this may also
i mean see i'm thinking that any nor did begin begins go there is either going to be true or false
they'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have i'll puts that can feed the rest the belief that i
so if there is an and there is mode of transportation and then

so you quit have two different things you could do you
it's probably does that doesn't happen
not only is it cleaner to computed separately but it could be that used multiple places
i happen to state and you know
because it means that already something that's tired

didn't want to ride greediness but
would every daughter kept it very simple
you quite let's do that so you just want to have them all pointing to a
mean are there are large things that you have to pay to get up close too
in the car and have to enter the park

@reject@ i
be specific for second here
and they'll be a user go there
what's the word didn't drafted the e. v. thing if there's one view it
be a big c. p. t. it's not completely impossible i

like to keep this one because i want to see if we're going to re use any of this
so this might jeeze
and we probably would have something like a discourse fork and point
this is something but the situation comes from traffic and so forth and
that still allows for the possibility of the user model affecting our decision about whether a strike is the sort of thing which is going to keep this user away from not right

the idea was we were going to do two things my gone
what wanted to see that
but things be more instructive to think about other decisions that we need to make an past land
and what they're going to look like

fries for each down here
note and again that would have to be computed by someone else
of the i mean it if users tired these state
false so it's for

friend how
i mean it seems that you could it seems that those things would be logically independent like you would want
which is be in point decision based on the user box so what we
right not in the car and have to enter the park

you know you anything until dominion switched
maybe that they're finally and i the very bottom end point decision to the go there no find
impossible i mean it's not beyond what the system coolidge salts
but it's probably beyond what we could actually write down or learn

climbing robyn
i don't know but time you marriage
i'm more likely to enter
it it's so it's like i bachelor five hundred ones as heroes you eat in

so that's or know or and in toronto so they could gram everything that could contribute to weather person wants interview or approach something
and so this is my food here means the same as in point the snow as and poured
is it something you physically quit enter
so they get a two where's that can up more and more it's not expensive

it's eighty years where it gets a little tricky
a very basic one
we don't know what they are yet so that
so that to go their decision will have i know from discourse i what would just

that they put commercial
i was just going to commercial
then we can make do this state
or use a compatibility

wanted to see that is when we
is when we get into huge comets works and like that because
so you have this idea of the compatibility with the requirements of an action to the state of the user one could imagine that was
that so injustices as it as not was design problem

i don't know whether armies coming or not
we are just because they're nazi
maybe food could be if we started up again entered so of

go there in the first base and not this definitely one of the basic once we can
to a false
so there's this question about right here we

so have you seen this before all to for here for example
no but so have you seen this before all to these that things for example
the finance this sort of hear sawed off as the financial policy in person carries out in his life he's she cheap

and it's so simple even i can use it
that is simple it
so the let's take the case of the the standpoint thing the notion

is that you kind of range so that the the value of that he's going to have to be updated now it's not a belief
the apology we sort of said we would pool these various kinds of properties from the on like exhibiting selling and so forth so
and so forth so in some sense it's there

and if it doesn't fluent anything then you're going to need something that converts from the number here it to something that's relevant to the decision there so
there so it could be right there be different ranges that are relevant for different decisions or but for the moment
the thing is that every time and so but

or nothing down here i
we're going to have to somehow figure out somewhat encapsulated that
so if there is some general notion for example the relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has or something like that is be compatibility with his current state that's what you have to do you

but the part the good part is walking over and so
but that's temper that they're very temporally whereas
intimate

we had been designing is there were three intermediate nodes
could you move those up about halfway
without doing with the way we're defining it i think

unfortunately that was a of an intermediate version that's
now but we may wined up having to do that
edelman level that we were going to have to sort out so you know what

less likely to enter
what a hotel fall under
i would call that a service but

so let's think about this question of how're we want to handle
the two separate things one
they could actually be in plano because that's what the and that's where the situation comes up

is it a place of business
underscore he
see it if it's a if it's for things in each of them has four values but there's got to be a big c. p. t. it's too much

in particular so
reliable because you could have outdoor places that sell things and
i mean level of interest it's from the user motto no not

if it's close to one probably won't answer if it's
if it's not accessible to the tourist ever the likelihood of that person actually wanting to answer it given
all right let to answer it given that you know so of course

the ones that use and selling i
and sometimes people say why is that
know that doesn't change but in most cases separate

some places that service things so things or fix things and it says acidic exhibit things
not either or suddenly
suddenly pissed to be able to tell and the same sites

things that could either do is to sell things fixing six service things but things can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things
many come to mind things
if you can afford it and performance preconditions

there a save as inside a java based
but i can just take it
somebody else is built this user model i see right gone take treacherous

advantages that is the technical one
and the other is that it gets used to it so we doing sub grouping
and the other is that it gets used to it so we doing sub grouping

without doing without and to if you start definition of view it's free
so is approaching
i've really important in the belief world that we're about to have loops

today we can decide that isn't the right thing to do was
time of day so now the other thing that buffet appoint not is what this is that there should be a link and this

so but then we should sort of have all of the design of what influences what done before we decide exactly how to computed
so i didn't get a chance to look at all the that's

like a girl does
what's another decision you like

not so what given
this is like the number that up is how much money they have left to spend

and so that's got to come up with some initial things one could surf so who is
so who is the user

no not right here that this is something that number that could keeps on changing
this is understandable

no but i think i'm following it
so far so here's the we had that the user sponsored me influence the outcome of decisions

update right it's you took some action just spent money and of
ewing usually is cheap

the thing is that every time that updated believes that the property it but so but
c. taste the it can be it's usually can be used for multiple decisions

right it's probably does what track i mean and she needs thing there was this altered like probably entrances it suggests that doesn't happen
so what we talked about is three separate in point decision so that's like

to my dishes we just pick something down here
the same mode and then point i thought more

after the first one let's do the one that we sort of already think we did so that was the
so that was the end of the end point

or nothing down here i would just sit there and everyone's
maybe we can think of more things cross

it's just the point is just but it's being some of those are subhuman by
drunk if the person talking is angry or slurs or speech and not be tired or you know

the charles bridge be it for a given segment
the charles bridge be it for a given segment

you'll see it you'll see something comes up immediately everything i want to do this we while the
i the easiest thing would move them movie in point right

had design now we can change design to design
they could actually be in plano could seedy feed into the go there ass where the situation comes up

then what you and i have to talk about is if we doing that then they get combined somehow how do you combined but there are
but that was actually unfortunately

so that the belief in itself has properties
and the properties are filled in from on polls yet it's so the let's

the notion was it that if you had a few key properties like is this a tours site you know some kind of landmark is
could be we could them having to be ignored that just being point and to go their ass nor do sudafed into

right on here for example if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something if
if it's exhibiting it's outside is that mark

meaning more likely to give you what
if it is exhibiting pictures source contras and like this then it's more likely to be and church

no sensibility man's if it's
maybe should be renamed into physical state

so it's selling fixing in servicing what thing
and we may change on but

or does it is to commercial action insides recruit or
does it is a commercial or

landmark
successful i number westies accessible that

i mean it seems like it's much more reliable because
and they can mess with this one

i'm just thinking about how and what's the best way to organize this so that it's clean and consistent and all that sort of
me so in terms of the planner what's a good one to do that's this whether

i'm just thinking about how people human beings who know about places and places to go and someone would store the center would
and i said let me suggest do something else

a counselor or can be
to not in terms of you know whether you want to go there the time of day that i

and i've been to move on
so you can only enter pays if you are not too tired to do so

and so now we looking for user religious things that
and maybe they maybe just one who was a user i don't know maybe that

user i don't know maybe there's more
if it's issues if he's in the car right now

we have they use their interests as a factor five hundred values so
and then there's a sort of a law says that if you go and look at it you much each is something that comes from it discourse in terms of what was actually just had what's

i mean level of interest it's from the user motto no not
user model i see right so why gone take treacherous versus thorough how is this versus

and it doesn't you the flavor though of you have a know
you know whether you want to go of day that i

compacts so could be compatibility with this current state which
which would include is money in this time in his energy it just

would even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had an can make you so
if we do we don't have the three values

i think mean looking at the little data that we have
no it's much worse than that howler dissipates it or through it

be a link and this is where things are going to get very messy from
messy from me and point decision maybe i to find

it blew it it's not the friend it's not defined through their lips you things don't converge or recurrence affection
it blew it it's not the things don't converge or recurrence

there now and if you you if you needed to do that
thinking i maybe i'm complaining that user now would with possible asking of the user you know

you know given the you know there's a strike do still want to go but
i said everybody knows it's want to

as we started of is this detail in b. c. just going to worry about the various constructions that people might use
and john ellis committed himself to being the parts are wizards so

everybody knows it's want to you know get closer that'll be the game then so
be the game then so the semantics that you'll get out of the discourse will be values that go in to the various discourse based decision ups and

as a paper

so my idea for today we can

so there's and the idea was we were going to do two things my gone

things one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what

and then as they real separate but related to ask pacific

pacific buster and i were going to try to decide what claims of belief nodes are needed in order to do what we need to do once

i think we conduct discuss everything first

you're going to go there or not so what given

of the basic once we can start but that's

we actually got just probably the cheese fries for each

it's eleven states the reason it might not be true or false you is that we didn't have this idea of when

or you to go there be binary and given that you're going there friend how

independent like you would want to have some separate a binary go

separate a binary go there and then the possibility of how to go there because

let's start that way

time

everything that is user comes the use immortal everything that

use immortal everything that a situation comes in the situation one way

should be care but when

but when it comes to sort of writing down

you sort of have to add right the value is this can take

and here i was really in some sometimes it was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeding very stupid because

stupid because in this case it's pretty simple but

pretty simple but as we will see the other ones

for example if it's a running budgets so what other discrete values or running budgets

so maybe my understanding there's too impoverished

there we wanted to keep server running toward off

how is it different from visa fans

he's she cheap ever trust spendy

user thrift come

so keen what's behind this is actually a program that will once you feel all this and actually solve your belief that for you and so this is not just

displayed this is actually a two week to me simulator that will if we eat all the right things will wind up with the functioning belief in it at the other end

does matter was i can think of people it would be and she's irish or spendy we can even have a finer scale moderate to cheap doesn't not

so here's what's permissible is happy

updated now it's not a belief update right it's you

what track it down but

one of the items for thee user home base should be especially non local

they're only there for the day and they don't have a place to stay

you know @reject@

or nothing down here i

it's just the point is just but it's being in point if you're crossing some of those are subhuman by approach

is just but it's being in point if you're crossing over it are subhuman by approach

you know you first go to the town square

bridge it doesn't really matter which way you cross

what i teach of you a tourist

in fact the other two aren't up there

so one with scientology

what type of building is it that

and the third thing we talked about with something from the discourse

right so what we seem to need here this is why

need here this is why it starts getting into the technical we had

which were the end point decision as seen from the user model has seen from the on college in a scene from the discourse

we had design now we can

but there are undoubtedly going to be more things to worry about

i ask about slurred and angry as inputs to this

but that was what he had in mind

two one is how do we want to handle the notion of the on apology

now what we talked about this is another technical thing great is can we arrange so that

so that some somehow someone would find this word look it up in neon pathology pull out these properties put it in two the belief in that and then the decision would flow

so what that says is that we might be able to take and

all right let me suggest there's

all on of these if it's fixing

these if it's fixing things setting things or servicing things

important but for this kind of purpose one of these places is quite like the other

from the belief that point of view it is from another

is and this is that the object type note

@reject@ so i made it but is it the kind of object that sells takes a services things

just created it depending on so far

let's not objects we called

successful i think is different but that's temper

whereas this is a

that a service but i don't know

what is it underscored t. the end of each of those things that if i things

so we're derived thing this this future of whether the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we're driving that from what kind of activities down there can you have

can you have it as just a primitive future of the entity you probably that's it that's a choice

entity probably that's it that's a choice

and you know indoor places that do something else the problem

places that do something else the problem with it is that it's sort of putting in the future just for one decision now but we may wined

so you know what is this look like what are

is this look like what are intermediate things that are worth computing one of the features we need

one of the features we need in order to make all these decisions and what's the best

would store the center would probably you wouldn't just sort of remember that they sell and then deduce from that and then it must be going on inside i think and two maybe

it must be going on inside i think and two maybe should be regarded as a victor of several possible things that could either

or can be a landmark and not excessive of some statue

just as is just maybe could save as to keep your old one and clean and

they were done was not that important i think but

not a big deal then but

this put this let's do and point under are argue

in point

so that's the end point decision as seen through the

so that's i that's in point

people with harry drove the car into the comfy

this is screwed

never but so said that but then the question is

this is one of my problems we have they

one is you could ignore it

just doesn't mention no it's

and we say that this interests affects the likelihood of and

schedule

it like because if you have everything pointing to want to know what it's like explanation

so they get a two advantages that

suburb thing intimate

demo making more tree like going backwards

it's hard for me to imagine how everything wouldn't just contribute to use state again

and anyway we're going to have to find some way to get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible

if we look at thee the end point again we said that for each of these things there's certain preconditions

and also have the money to do so across something so

entering get going through some

so you save this one has an open up the old one right in

i think we're saving this and i think that i'd

this and i think that i'd like to keep this one because

what makes things more like the

the first thing is to getting back to thing we left on the other is the actual discourse

but just see ways we didn't we don't have scientology here

but the discourse we don't have a representative at all yet

some people say how do i that too the castle

and this usually means they want to go there

in order to find out hard to get there

without wanting to go there

know that doesn't change the fact that you're you want these two values

all the discourse and then either it's either they are and they

what's the word

thing if there's one view it then it's fine to go there it's closed whereas

right whereas if they want to

right so that's where it starts getting to be in potentially more interesting so what

it does matter though there's like a striker right or something

it know because this that north by itself wouldn't distinguish
