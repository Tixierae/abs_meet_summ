or the remote it
you said that you could be on two different lines
so big flat structure
i don't know at least that's very usually i mean you know and you have
whether the destination was the final destination
whether this nation closer all
so so no it for north down there that sort of the things that are not crafty extracted actually five things
but it's a actually no it from the other end
in here done mention like we don't have no it's for discourse in parcelle although like in
i don't know if that question certain general are you i mean there
now we don't get the values but in general they would be
again all those a binary i
that i kind of thought of doing business is more running errands type thing the castles and setter business on the other hand
i said know did we have size this one
the so tom cruise
i think doubt connect to like what would effect
but inhibit that right
it might be worth i it's not like
i mean it makes it clear but then that i mean friends that's true
i mean friends of this the discourse does what do you mean by that
or maybe a famous restaurant or
what sort of discourse processing is as is
so whenever d. person is not actually we checking what happened before as
i'd rather stay home and watch t. v.
doesn't that ring a bell

we're also high tech
and this is a reaction to separate future would have decided
a lot of data be were saying things like can i get this base what
navigation on my navigation
by anything time of days like morning afternoon night is that they do
it does are what do they allow business people to be doing non business things at the moment
a variable writing and just marginalized is
so for exxon post statue
it might be worth we could ask someone
these days is you laugh you what you wonder once what you want to open it but see that i
logistic fast i don't know if he actually busy i have a good
know it's like friendy allows you into things the data tables
web is updated for an x. m. l. version of i pays that's as a business
i think we i and in that note would be various things that could specifically come up
i think that the despite those of heidelberg or various things that you might not want to eat a meal there but
of not just i mean there's a change across several turns to score so i don't
score so i don't know how of but business power it if at all this is going to interact with whatever general other discourse crossing that might happen
research so we should kind of image that's reasonable not go all the way back to adam and eve you know to the person
was a while ago transcontinental or doesn't that ring
i don't know it's in a lot of blowing it up you have to go somewhere

the context we simplified
it's just a businessman stores and furbies
and the because it's just whether the verb is they tango for urban enter of urban or a just ever that one needs and
no that is a lot of work but right that
but it's a actually no it from the other end
it's a it's sort of is because actually no it is other end
it's sort of is because it's because we have that have a day in the it just it is probably closer to this
up around in here so we haven't done mention like we
everything is probably like then you just have some probabilities of over
but in general they would be a properties which overalls birds
that is a question mark after in that picture is a binary
inhibit that right
we have see the function of hasn't become all point
that's kind of annoying
so just dismiss everything closes and
was like an x. m. l. format for base that's that is it eczema
it the ordering is very clear on very friendly see that's like figure
my first approach fails

is the property discourse verb choice and
suggestions office lied like you have a you think you'd have find you mean
rights argument usually
right thee mode like way
reason i say that i'm at a summer free this today we had observed everything in favor of the it or and they came
and they came up to tango
you can figure out how to turn it off and tango
it's hard to sort of set one another that like strong be test and then the rather than whether or not they're two or so what's interesting is that it's than that would determine it
or so what's interesting is that it's not with that on
be of it is it just like kept the old function for
and it also helps in coordinate seeing the gesture screen issue so
fish we can quarry it weathered admissions peas were discussed last turned and the turn before

they'd all be like pointing to
rather tours that kind of thing is although so that's you know probably stick klee depends on the other things heard from the other ones
i so so says given in there and do it right
then of course there's this sort of binary as
tricky so i the question is so far i have no really are no real argument whites differentiate between the truce is statues and how is the never tease
what if the coat kind of a greasy
something grip context yes
i'll prob premieres really
like concert you want to see the magic flute or something
you have to have some notion of not just i mean
gus not every macho keeps of memory of everything that happened

some of them are sort of either world knowledge or situational things into suit their decision
on my navigation
on my navigation
the sort of a landmark there's this sort of the object rights
maybe a distance we do one too in their cost they
in their cost they may also tennis with the person is in a hurry or not i
you know what i like about these meetings is one personal nod and then i special knowledge goes all the way around the room
i missed my turn
i mean it makes it clear but then that i mean friends that's true
does of the discourse admission fee note seems like it should point directly to or increase by that
can sort of as a very character fish we can quarry

but the middle thing we were thinking along lines of maybe trying to you figure out like the concept of whether a tourist or whether they're running an errand or something like that along those lines
from the disperse it either like school are topic based
those and then the second row or ever that road time of day through that so all of those some of them come from the other instead some of them are sort
but we just decided to people the things extracted the point at the middle and then down
why is the landmarks
it's nighttime they have not discussed admission fee and then the not walls and i say i
maybe the biased toward ten
it's weird to talk about other so
and it's because you know that person actually is funding you know the a whole kind of going through a hundred and fifty steps you know without any information other than new york
you know there's probably no train from you know right

to separate future would have decided to put on the same line for space
we navigation old reasons or something
going can be like non thursday landmarks in
just says that if you the mirrors do the whole thing is
and i say i that sort of makes sense
period whether it's whether it's a public building and whether it's actually has a door
you have to trust so just
anybody might be they just have a script that you know it's
it's like they're those the two options either

reasons being you know it'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that
that would be whatever building they referred to
i love walls like a
fan and it's i'm starting to grow on me
actually it's wouldn't affect any of our no it's right
before as an no i really don't want to see that movie
but just a question how do you do we want to search you know
but we should just try to keep in mind that you were doing this sort of for research so we
but if it's possible

there are a couple more things and one thing that
we can do is the devil
but the demo doesn't work very
then it wouldn't be a demo i mean
beginner loving it up again
so i think the ira presentations finished
about thinking too hard to
thinking too hard to maybe yes
or any good dog pizza like concert you want to see the magic flute or something

so the issue is that in believe this is not common to do what we did it if like having you know it's a bunch of values and then i know and as an actual value what's comedy
what's comedy just like going into a variable writing and just
i went at it the functioned going to that right
i it's not like be could sort of a page that had like a bunch of yes i teeny sneeze one
that's all right i can probably double
it expecting this is just been just want to it because
somebody right runs up to with a sisters intensive yuck
not direct
probably a transfer in chicago

you are in control
it's a need this good ideas of
because we were thinking they're in a hurry there'd be less likely day like it one two just
a day in the it just had the grand what kind of clothes all right self
it's because we're talking about and marxist first denmark not as
not as possible navigation
i conjunction of i don't know
i don't think it did learning

and they would look pretty
went to go to this place
beef is that it can take values in the fall reps that they bust these
the good like the weather is this and this that say forty percent for this like
you know so i was just going to happen
observed it so i it's civ averaging or all those people us please
that might be worth it
it looks like this the

and then i do that a mess everything up i was wondering
talk about it when i get the picture up
true false that's
read it so abused child is like it's really i had
there's actually a text file given it
for that and so something grip context

furbies is actually personally amusing and the
so we would have fun doesn't mean then if we have to we have
to we have an object type stature it
it really is an object type so
score so i don't know how of
to taps and enough for a solution and it fails in all the structures that are make tips so

doesn't actually help the distinguishing the two cases though whether
actually to recall journey complaining about something to do with entering provo this is probably
things that isn't job
eyesight i thought that because source
i don't know if it actually would have paid the source so that might be but complicated
the burbs used the optic types used modify errors and maybe there's

i'll get rid of the bad notes
at all this landmark for terroristic reasons and then mark for our
i don't know at least that's very usually i mean you know and you have
so existing variable it's trouble they're not so they
know if there's a way to fight it or maybe you know generalize in some way

versus like i was at this
person i'm ourselves not going to be
wouldn't can they also be they're not exclusive
laws is something that we extract a knowledge
what set they set the context rhino

so the thinking behind that was we have these teachers we'd run from the communication of some like someone summons
is by but it this binary that's true
is by but it doesn't have a question mark because is extracted that's true i see your point
run out of cash as a tourist and so it was it
it's i mean these con scheme us i mean that notification work for that

what's the fastest way you
i see a lot of those knows could be expanded the base that's their own
and they might be useful here too i don't know
somewhere maybe it was recommended to chicago but there was like
be wrong though was a while ago transcontinental

they don't discuss admission fee make that falls
i mean the vice mayor java bases you have like that and it that seems kind of redundant
and then if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything all the information is needed what happens
forth so even without in and not for somebody has to make that information we had only on is still here
you know and it's fifty steps

you know this is accent because it's just taking all these terms just that maybe
expecting it and then maybe destined discourse in the discourse and it's the bigger
it and then maybe destined discourse acts if they had before and
and it's more for q. that the person actually once i get some whereas in that
it track happen and it's

because i'm going to switch to the java bays program and then
no it's you want to do u. mass transit windows all that in the side isn't there
i can do that but i have to in the presentation in the middle so i can go back to open up java base
the great actors i can see how it's done has store properties or

like that clean it
you of a building was
if you can look up because i mean if you're going to get real close to the building and the tango mode rate is going to be a reason for
rate is going to be a reason for it's

like i was at this place in europe or they had little carvings of like dead people walls or something
i said it was that a middle layer at
i don't know if that's always today i
this way we can say these conducive but disco cinnamon and they may

the person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea like i
i don't know this job is of what that it might be that you had
i mean it's interface is not that good so
but actually it had interface a lot of them

the threat but we
on know right so this final best so it seems like that
but other things without question marks on but
like that and it that seems kind of redundant

so the mode has three different outputs probably
see that's like figure out like to go going the layout of the table
so if they said they would also funnel into one know that would constitute entrance requirements or something like that
i don't know it's in a lot of blowing it up a bell you have to go somewhere

so the millionaire salsa binary no
somebody close i
so we can either be in a hurry are not but we cannot
they that result is never going to answer that doesn't know

hasn't become all point fives or not
child is like really i had i have a niece a lot i haven't used
niece a lot i haven't used it in the last you know many months so
like said like little script

i it makes it easier to do powerpoint certainly does
let's see i want to query right thee go and like way
but they can never be an church

why are you doing this and this more than on the presentation because i'm going to switch
i have a self course stan
be the know what's the obsessed no it's for you or mentally or

like in my building just it right and
on the other things heard from the other ones
right now we don't observed it so i

but not a landmark at all
be they're not exclusive groups are they
and the person says i want to see it

you have and features a student in their expansion
it's are you assuming that are not like is that to
seems like it would for it determine whether they want to go into or not

yes because things you could expect from the data that hidden variables yes
so then that in with hair variables we came up with or whether someone was on it or running errands over there in a hurry
is something that is learning the probably these also

and then but look at the belief that i mean sessions
i mean sessions which today other program
i mean in a way this is hardly teaches in job but

so he said that for the purposes of this reason just a the words that but
everything but even check
closes and build up their own state doesn't screw that

in parcelle although like in some sense t. are parts of disbelief that but
friends so we can you know set some of the no it's and go ahead
how much still kind of smart common

into suit their decision isn't but
no because we the way we said the problem these might not
it's an issue right like

whatever grinder upon hour or just we could just read it just disguise
whatever grinder upon hour or just we could just read it just disguise it
this announcement listen stereo

on for a store also i've known or on
also i've known or on know right so this
she would have in order for like whether or not you can be entered

laws binary closes binary
binary closes binary
final destination again all those

that's that's it's so we have to like fit the probably
spent my you practicing the tango della more today
this guy so but he doesn't use it so in what sense yuppie

but i get to the bank i see
and that looks like really want to enter you
so that terrorists know that should be very consistent with the context and but if you said that's

but we can do this because he's president
we were i sweeping in terms of the switch that actually but
things to do for that not i don't know if i go to i'm happy with the way it is

we have it saved
so it's not up to speed
just looks it especially as much trucks

see so this is the door
or increase probability enter directly versus going there via tourists
or because like i'd more middle of those like could get out

you're right the cold or
you're right the cold or do you actually never have to be court
just start up a new to us

pays that's as a business back for an exile he's like
habit of doing that but
disco cinnamon and they may have their own hidden they are that points to some of the real do today or of the general had there and the same

so maybe this couldn't be of a separates region off the net which has tool has its own mid layer maybe
pasta said and then attended onto the discourse history which is and one of the most elaborate leverage much of it's it's actually the
it's actually the whole of memory of the entire system and knows what will was said watch which was what was presented to taps and

that makes sense those the two options either like make an hour directly or put in you know it
and if it if you do it's expected too hard you may get some phenomenon that back so how much of it costs are entering the answers
what movie was selected and what's in the mind what town it's going to be sort of added into the disk into the be representations of everything and it's a lock up the school smart or is this

they want to go to the first one i'm
i know last my car so

so then the features we decide there we decided we were talked about and
no we have separate but are you saying that in this particular demeaning happen say that landmark tennis court is correlated with

because i suggestions and actually feature
north up for us to figure out what kind of going there is happening and

you think you'd have a post office is that you know you know something you mean
one time i was at this so

but see the thing is that it but if i took deviating from the outside or something like that
and the same we will be able to do for some tactic information the burbs used

but if you look at it real close to get seated anchored intricacy of the a little so that counts
little so that counts as wall is

exactly so do you want to inspect at close range is interesting i
there's a termed it's often used

if we moved on to the next step in did learning of some sort corning about spirit would be handicapped
but you could see perhaps just got the admission fee going directly to the mode pointing enter right

right now it's still kind of and a toy version of it because
because we didn't know the probabilities of her

actually five things the lowest is also
the lowest is also a contract extracted i

it's because we have that have probably closer to this
another i from the disperse it so there are certain cues that are very strong either like school are topic based concept q.'s for one of

but the idea that these extract those features from them so we don't actually have a north intact farce because
so the context being i don't know if that question

farce because you'd never do infants on it anyway
so some of the top row things what's disk

can i get this base what is the admission fees that's like a huge oakley
there that's like a huge oakley that they're trying to enter the pace rather than to tango or missed it i see

the one thing that we were saying he was by doing the layers like this
it we kept things from directly affecting the mode mowed be on the concept but you

we are just using the particular part of the context which consisted switched to the flicked indicate visitor tourist or not i so says
we could manipulate the source itself

all contact similarly broad cities are all across the but simply
the but simply proper poses is whether or not they appear tend to relax

so it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus terrorist
everything is probably like so then you just have some probabilities of over or which

like some probabilities of over or which of those is
right so then that mark is

right others and that information i mean you know the for abuse and some other that would determine exactly
right others and that information i mean determine exactly

know if that's always today i haven't looked at the do as much as you have so
it's always working in some

cost they may also tennis with the person is in a hurry or not i
or not i want to get to the church quickly

say about the we could but the demo doesn't work very we can do is the devil
can look at the x. files

we could do a demo in the sense that we can
observe knows i mean we could do a demo in the sense that we can just i'm just after the fact that this would in fact doing friends so we can you know

that is like maybe the fact they use and we're actually forget
don't see the discuss the admission fee

that's an interesting point whether you're you want to do at the moment
it's not i think it's more like are you a tourist are you in i'm

point whether you're it's but it's not i think it's more
that's a different they wanted to conduct which is i thought that's directly given by the context switch

i'd in this context notices but if i don't know like and but if you said that's more there in general what they're kind of
i'd in this context notices but if in general what they're kind of

simple if we create something that for example would be
so some things can be landmarks and your sense

some reason i had that doing this but i at some point it
some reason i had that i can that was i thought that i had at one point but then at some point it

@reject@ with that
accessibility or something or

and then there's also the question of whether it may be entered
in the sense that in the house of tom cruise it's answerable but you may not entrance

is or not public and nodded or equivalent things it
just buying a ticket counter you know and maybe

it has wonderful
and that's if you too cutting carvings cravings

miles for tricky so i
what it doubt connect to like

it's it affects when i was thinking was if a like
it's it affects the doing business businesses something not it could affect directly could affect was if a like

in job but has goalie and it's
i mean do things it does learning is

which is the web positive
maybe another thing that but

work that i like word pad because it has the the returns the carriage returns
the carriage returns on some of them

security leave it at that
it just it the ordering but they're not very friendly

like to go going the layout of the table
so that might be but complicated anybody

so this means so they
so they pull up the that again yes because you put the

and something else that happened in the discourse before
and this may influence these hidden notes of the discourse which is maybe

and it's making those for
this you know it has some sucky thing that this if this

and maybe they are tool
which is maybe something that is what gen version of the actual phenomenon that you can observe so things

observe so things that point towards so instead of a single
so instead of a single noted for like if they said the word admission fee exactly

get some whereas in that you're in a in a rowlett's
a rowlett's sort of proceeding past these things so this would be

so this again punch to find a destination doing business truest hurry and so forth
and so then we can say we have a whole

we have a whole region that's the whole setup discourse related cues to your middle there
region it expecting that's the whole setup discourse related cues to your middle there

meaning its way out of my budget
they're places

everything else free than lesser into their food and drinks
food and drinks so

because it's just too expensive
i think i see so the discourse refers admission fee but it just turns out that they change their mind in the middle of the discourse

they tried to figure our contention rights
but just a question how do

this it won't differentiate between it's but i do said
somebody that wants to go someplace north up for us to figure

i don't know there in non into the more traditionally i kind of plan recognition things that have you know some idea each turn of each and doing something what
what plans consistent with and

to handle i

goatee cans i've never had them

goatee cans to my understanding never had them

tin cans did he do these things

it at seven to do that

or the remote it because i'm already up

get another pet powerpoint presentation

one of these buttons will do this for me

they want to go to should go back to the first one

introduce especially middle there

middle there talks but it's the first of the fact that one of the main things we had to do was to sideward fourteen into media says no it's where i can read

but if you're really going to find out what's the bush after tikanava's to the

i've never i don't know what the labels before i didn't

it what the labels before i didn't and all that into my harper presentation

it opens the assistant because of that the fun types just presentation

not realize the window proceed

but what do you want to do u. mass transit

choice and we had a list of things like to go and to visit and whatnot

the landmark units of i need

nashville if you can look up because

it's either because you're in route to something else or you want to look at the walls

the context which in this case we've limited to businessperson torah store i know

we are open to suggestions right can i

right can i ask the walls part of it is that in this particular domain you said that you could be

either could but those online or open suggestions office lied like you have a you think you'd have and find you mean

one time i was at this but see the thing i took deviating so is a stand in for like architecturally it significant or something like that

but if it's target actually thinking you might be able to see it from like

it was a long time ago there's a lot of those

often used city and see the stadiums if not checked

and i was just wondering whether that's the same as what you describe is none martinez

i mean enough it can be very and but not a landmark

but not a landmark at all this

we went to stick reasons or something

but you can imagine maybe wanting you know that both kinds of things there for different goal

going can be non thursday landmarks in

direct navigation out they're not mutually exclusive

direct navigation out they're not mutually exclusive

so i initial idea was not very satisfying because this idea was all the features pointed out but note

idea like i am that's a good evening i'm a taurus i went to go

we going to chat features along lines of where they want to go in

to go in what they said breeze and whatnot and then we have

whatnot and then we have the means that they should use right

or they might right because your view things would be

or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to as like a navigation one to go to another place

it's maximize

probably the whether the probability of is to tango or enter

no that one needs a lot of not at all that is a lot of and are those mutually exclusive that right

work but that would've made the probably significantly more complicated enter so he said that

she mentioned things about this poster that

things about this poster that i am not they're not coming to my mind right now

ride together once a final destination the whether they're doing business with in a hurry and rather tours that

the and the more you know depends and all those things

the actual parsoes somewhere up around in here so we haven't done mention like we

whether they discuss the admission what's disk admission

whether they discuss the admission fee so we took the data admission

there'd be other things besides just the admission fee but it i see

but that was like an example

that was the initial that was like an example

that was the initial another i so there are certain cues

more things and i would extras to just go through this one more time so we resolved agree on what the meaning of these things is at the moment

is at the moment the what is the one thing

the what is the one thing i you know i'm about is how we have the diskette the admission fee thing set up

versus pointing to just a taurus

they're that i'm is fishing to the forests

the tables disc admission fees it's by anything time of days

that's how we have a economy set up but it could be

whatever set up but it could be you know based upon hour or

normally continents so do you one information but we

right so it's not greedy all contact similarly

do you this other the context as a switch between tours on for a store and

will saver abused is like right

rather than me beef is that it

is extracted i see your point

are not but we cannot be in the medium hurry at the moment we do

we do that would add another value for that and that

and that would require is updating probably do should be for more as because if they're not

because if they're not like take that begin to god

so of course this will happen when we think more about the kinds of herbs that are using e. cheeses but

e. cheeses but you could imagine it's for plus various other things that are also not in the bottom layer that would help you

the no it's and then try to find a probably even it's go ahead

do the whole thing is that is like

and faith has walls

and the time it is night no it's that doesn't

let's see i want to query right thee go and like way

that is probably the entering this i or time going and

if so lightly biased toward ten going get

maybe the biased toward ten going is yours then

that's that's it's so we have to like fit

however you know the purpose was not really at this stage to come over i mean it's to tease but

to tease but to get thinking about that hidden missile there and so

i when silly today more will get more hidden nodes

not because it would expedite the probabilities because it wouldn't it she's a down

wouldn't it she's a down tremendously

i think we should have though when you live near the

i think we should have exponentially more middle those then features we've extracted the

so are doing business versus terrorist baby search

terrorist baby search your current task i quit current thing

i quit current thing you want to do at the moment

that i kind of thought of doing business is more they wanted to conduct which is not set but still they say things like i want to go c. d. the castles and setter

so if you thing business on the other hand it's definitely what you're doing

so if you run out of cash as a tourist and you need to go to the so it was it i see you have a task you have to go get money

run out of cash as a tourist and so it was it

go to the you have a task you

go to the you have a task you have to go get money so youre doing business at that stage

it's hard to sort of set one another that like strong like is that to be i mean that's accurate than that would determine it

but yes you can say on unknown

and different other of everything else there was out to be the same

we i don't know what it takes to add another north it their observatory and they around with it

it another norton what

it depends on how many things it's like what

that's just say making really simple if we create

maybe we want to have the landmarks meaning no and trouble and mark something that's simply just the vista point for example that's true

the statue so existing variable

i said they're not so they can answer the question mark

of landmark

had at one point but then went away

is it kind of be entered

and that's you whatever his divorce lawyer or something

and he's a very upset both sort from the apologies sort of things doesn't actually help the distinguishing

though whether it's practically speaking in trouble or actually physically in trouble or not it

if you're running an errand you maybe more like it to be able to enter places that aren't usually not and you know usually not allowed to out that's good this i can see why seems like it would for it determine whether they want to go into or not

that's good this book here

so it's a metrics between if it's not answerable period whether it's whether

so tom cruise has is not a public building but it has a door

good shh explain to me why

explain to me why it's necessary distinguish between whether something has door and is not public very

something it seems like it's equivalent to say that doesn't have a door and is or not

things it seems like in practice

type so there is there's going to be a bunch of stature is

for something an object type that's ever tell

the most famous building in work is actually a hotel so

hotel so because some of the time which is

which is the only renaissance building had to park that was left after the big destruction and for thirty years walked out is it walls

it has is it walls

but still and i'm back to candidate for the tango parts it

i think it might effects actually what would effect

businesses something not it could affect directly could affect doing business would have store

it might be that you had a new thing pointing to write was just like it still write everything but

eighteen it true

there you can read it so abused child is like it's really i had

yes i you sneeze one to ask i would say

yes i you sneeze one to ask i would say he might know

maybe it is a little bit of learning i don't remember all right

but it's free

had interface a lot of them were like

coat kind of a greasy that

one i don't know if his uses it i see no this is a news

they're name presented us nope

all right i can probably double click or

these days is it openness theoretically

go right mouse

was just i was dead to the world

was no that's my favorite is work that

how you auto feels i or whatever you call it

that's how i actually probably the tables just specified his likeness

his likeness numbers

should be could write a program that could generate this that

but can maybe writing interface for

but can maybe writing interface for entering problem each student easy

know it's like friendy allows you the data tables

like friendy allows you into things the data tables

different if they're snakes smell it that they can also read

i mean it just reads this fried when it starts

i know there's and i was looking on the web is updated

he's like this guy has java

so in what sense yuppie

you can and you get ordinary both

a i couldn't miss read the webpage that habit of doing that but

do i have more slides

i think every presentation have i should have a future works lied

but it's weird

that's future maybe i don't know if there's

that's future work if there's

and of course the vivid presentation that doesn't have some it doesn't work at all and you have what i learned as a slide

i missed my turn

i really i went that's right and you

that again yes there we go because you put the net up again

so it's more general thing then discussed admission fee could be i get just wondering

i get just wondering whether the context the background context of the discourse might be i don't

way there might be other cues that say in the last few odder and says there's been something that strongly associate with say one of the particular modes

think sort of general strategy here

just that maybe we took we could observe a couple of discourse phenomena such s. b. admission fee

admission fee or maybe you know how much to enter or you know something

or you know something other opening

other cues exactly they would opening hours or something like that

so if they said or something like that

i mean it sort of get into plan recognition kinds of things in the discourse and it's

want to it because at the end the more we add you know the more spider web is just going to become in the middle of the more of and the thing it's

of and the thing it's going to get very active this

and maybe there's a hidden there for that and so something

one thing that's kind of been begging me when i'm i look at this is that

i the fact that the there's a complete separation between the observed features and then the output

middle of those like could get out of north like that they want to enter it which is affected

they want to enter it which is affected by it mission fee i that there's always time go that has a door so

the answers twin it fifty dollars

they're places in germany where cost in fifty dollars to enter

nothing comes to mind

despite those of heidelberg various things that you might not want to eat a meal there but

i think that the i mean nothing beats they did mission charge prices in japan

so they're trying to daughters is this moderate forgetting into to

but it you know it weekend something

weekend something somebody could have discussed admission fee and the answer is if we

it looks like this the the first thing we get is that already the intention is sort of they tried to figure our contention rights and about parsnips and this it won't differentiate between it's but i do said it tell us here we have something that somebody that wants to go someplace north up for us to figure out what kind of going there is happening and then if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything all the information is needed what happens is you know the pasta said and then attended onto the discourse history which is and one of the most elaborate leverage much of it's it's actually the whole of memory of the entire system and knows what will was said watch which was what was presented to taps and enough for a solution and it fails in all the structures that are make tips so and because you say i get to the castle on how much is it and i would like tube let's do it and so forth so even without in and not for somebody has to make that information we had only on is still here gus not every macho keeps of memory of everything that happened so whenever d. person is not actually we checking what happened before as an no i really don't want to see that movie i'd rather stay home and watch t. v. what movie was selected and what's in the mind what town it's going to be sort of added into the disk into the be representations of everything and it's a lock up the school smart or is this and it does some help any n. f. l. resolution and it also helps in coordinate seeing the gesture screen issue so person parking to something on the screen you know the discourse much actually stores what was presented and what location on this on the screen so it's rather huge interesting but we can sort of as a very character fish we can quarry it weathered admissions peas were discussed last turned and the turn before that or you know deeply want to search but just a question how do you do we want to search you know but we should just try to keep in mind that you were doing this sort of for research so we should kind of image that's reasonable not go all the way back to adam and eve you know to the person ever discuss efficiency season's paradise and the die ducks are pretty concise and it's i mean these con scheme us i mean that some of my extremely leverage you know what you need to buy a ticket you know and it's fifty steps just buying a ticket counter you know and maybe that's out some sort of could look at those it's amazing what you meant beings can do whatever we talked every at the except you know if you being us person on the ticket connor working in a way we're stationed somebody right runs up to with a sisters intensive yuck it track happen and it's because you know that person actually is funding you know the a whole kind of going through a hundred and fifty steps you know without any information other than new york and for you know there's probably no train from you know right but if it's possible and you probably have to transfer also somewhere else is that san score chicago it never went all the way right and you always have transit omaha rights one track and that there and the other one started to five meters away from that is anybody ever been on that track what sort of discourse processing is as is how much still kind of smart common probably a transfer in chicago i think i saw a report on trains i think there is no i don't know i thought there was a line where i'm from somewhere maybe it was recommended to chicago but there was like california chicago line of some sort i could be wrong though was a while ago i don't know it's in a lot of blowing it up i'm frightened by amtrak myself so one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the use of admission fee discussion as a cue for entry is thinking about the plans that there's people might have like all the different so general scheme is that they might be following this person is find out information about this thing in order to go in as a tourist or finding out how to get this place in order to business because then anything that's a cue for one of the steps would be like evidence for that overall plan i don't know there in non into the more traditionally i kind of plan recognition things that have you know some idea each turn of each and doing something what plans consistent with and then you get some more information and then you see here's a sequence that this so roughly fits into and they might be useful here too i don't know how you know you have to figure out what and all that but notification work for that not direct transcontinental or doesn't that ring a bell you have to go somewhere mostly you seem to know where the week i have but not chance e.

the first thing we get is that already the intention is sort of they tried to figure

our contention rights and about parsnips and

but i do said it tell us here we have something that somebody that wants

what happens is you know the pasta said and

you say i get to the castle on

the castle on how much is it

and i would like tube let's do it and so forth so even without in

and it does some help any n. f. l. resolution and it also

issue so person parking to something on the screen you know the discourse

you know the discourse much actually stores what was presented and what location on this on the screen so it's rather huge

so it's rather huge interesting but

interesting but we can sort of

and the turn before that or you know

deeply want to search

eve you know to the person ever discuss efficiency season's paradise

and the die ducks are pretty concise and

so one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the use of admission fee discussion as a cue for entry is thinking about the plans that there's people might have like

might have like all the different so general scheme is that they might be following this person

this person is find out information about this thing in order to go in as a tourist or finding out how to get this place in order to business

because then anything that's a cue for one of the steps would be like evidence for that overall plan

with and then you get some more information and then you see here's a sequence that this so roughly fits into and they might be

it's i mean these how you know you have to figure out what and all that but notification work for that

how you know you have to figure out what and all that but

us i mean that some of my extremely leverage you know what you

you know what you need to buy a ticket you know and it's

you know and maybe that's out some sort of could look at those it's amazing what

it's amazing what you meant beings can do whatever

you meant beings can do whatever we talked every at the except you know if you being us person on the ticket connor working in a way we're stationed somebody right runs

and you probably have to transfer also somewhere else

is that san score chicago i think

i saw a report on trains

i thought there was a line where i'm from somewhere maybe it

but there was like california chicago line of some sort

it never went all the way right

and you always have transit omaha rights one track mostly

and you always have transit omaha mostly
