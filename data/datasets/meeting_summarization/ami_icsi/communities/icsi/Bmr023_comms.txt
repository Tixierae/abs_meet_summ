travel too makes you turn your microphone on
channel your channel numbers already on this blank sheets they just
but i can set higher like
this this test that's that seems better
and then we were going to do something with the transcriber interface is one thing but i thought there
but you know what opportunity should we
pre chorus i think it's got some experience
because in all the previous experiment's we had the you know we were especially cheating by having you know the i have to contestants the base of the recognition and so now
it you think we should increase the
my chunks but with you or did
quick i mean i don't how long does your should
yet no
that we actually have a stream going i mean you know how it does and how and i print i think that would
because you know there's you know all the that was sitting there has been transcribed in there and they're faster that the pipeline is faster than than degeneration
they precipitation just so much i was extremely helpful now there was
this but actually it's so correct for so much of the time is an enormous times here
and just a sweet little run down trees
and they don't have to prove right before july
and they don't have to prove you know the unedited version they can just get their approval to whatever right before july in principle
ill anyway have what we've gone that's a lot to ask for people that have men and a lot of meeting
which i also being given some word features that are cheating because they're true words
sometimes editions consensus or the purchase was helpful i don't know if that's at actually
i don't know if that's cheating too
type finding sense boundaries finding this one's the boundaries and
one's the boundaries and then i had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt so where
so where you know if i'm talking now in some in an address is about to enter at me is he going to choose a certain place in my speech either preside a clear word based and they
and they are the presided futures actually showed up
fires and we just reporting very preliminary but suggestive results that some features both word and prop pathetic work
i think that was interesting to me is that the pitch features are better than in switchboard
and i think that really is from the coast talking mikes because
words for you know five where that much
tried that attitude and help dramatically
out of balance i didn't and then
by adjusting that the
they are change for probably one percent or so but you know given so
and really isn't sixty were you in sixty four
and really isn't sixty four so that's were you in sixty four
as i said before the using bands vocal tracks normalization option works very so
right and what that's just also is of course that the currents switchboard mot isn't trained on very good teachers new things but
what's actually quite interesting is that with
were in the too and it's probably something like there's one fewer one more filter in the sub one kill her and for whatever reason
and for whatever reason with this particular experiment is better one way or the
but it you know i don't know yet
right those two were together we were able to separate boxes or one
the low frequency cutoff else remember so that was
that's we have something more fancy it was like
unless you call if you call killed a friend and that's a little more but
that's what i meant for the tandem
for the tandem you know so we
so the you know so we can see if what effect it has on the tandem
i wouldn't expect huge and huge improvements
and all that so it may not apply but my recollection

anyway long we go and how good the snack is out there get
and so they truck
one which will because we had a lot of attrition and
too they die off after they do
you know it's various things so one
various things so one of them had a baby you know one of them really wasn't planning that was about unforeseen
so it makes sense it through attrition we were down to but they're really solid we're
good car but still transcribing this meeting
change i mean you can compare it to death on the just so
just shitty in principle i would say yes although i still i'm doing some the final past editing trying to converted
if they've to that i forget how we end right i figure
to that end right i figure how we ended up on this but
how we ended up on this but i remember my taking the position of not making it so easy for everybody to deserve everything and
it's just the audio was the trash can he wanted to do web interface that would make it
that would give you access to the transcript and you know you that's
and you know you that's what adam on it
it also be interesting to look at the e. d. u. meetings because we
meetings because we did include meeting tight as a features so
then then you do with the standard
and so so the of the code us know anything about that and so this is all
cancer percent but wasn't like
i because we need to do the exact experiment
i mean the reason i think it should is because you're putting in the same information and your transfer may need to be more discriminating

the gate begins up about it what usually is that if the
so i had a question for adam
anyway they won't be identical us somebody sings there in some sometimes you know things are so like an identical there get some advance intelligence right
anyway they won't be identical us somebody there get some advance intelligence
boring course
have an agenda
have to take the reciprocal the number because they have different meanings that to this one
and you slice them into so we just use those
see this is the issue subtleties the thing too it's changes clarifying question then you know how can they to it before they know her final version
i mean it's i one thing we're learning is that the amount we
is that the amount we have eight meetings there because we couldn't use
and whether or not some of the back channel and so forth
the rest of the month on the average it it should be
could have to do with the lower frequency cut off on the switchboard so that's actually good may maybe
but you know it didn't change the by adjusting
the turnaround time on the training when we train only the email system with you know are small training set this lesson play for our so we can run
why i wanted to look so him looked at i
him looked at i want to look at exactly where the filters were in the too and
this if this went back to i think wall street journal
made a parameter so it i if you get it right he did fix it and
some we're going to another thing that under s. and i were talking about was so
because in a sense then that's already got quite a bit of context and those teachers so if

my and they'll be funny when you're really reading digits and then there are the chunks but with you or did you see him
i don't know the last one seemed like it took a couple of weeks
but will be possible future because we
so you were saying something about organizing the meeting so
and have been putting it into a spreadsheet with start time the day the old meeting the new meeting name the number of speakers the duration of the meeting comments you know what it's transcription status is all that kind of and
of and so the idea is that we can take this and then exported h. announce mounted on the meeting recorder webpage that we can great
at because the pathetic features are very noisy and so you need a lot of data in order to model them
i'm so we're starting to see some patterns and we're hoping that maybe
to this point and i think it's something mari can probably in her preliminary report like we're
like we're at the point we're training these class fires and we just
true to try to get in on cheating version of how all this would work
i tried that attitude has which i think just talk about this the other day but that has never had a chance to changing and searching found these sort of things with with see using the tandem system
but you know given that murderous so that
but if you add them up you have almost five percent difference
so that's why i really know we better have a high pass filters just
high pass filters just you know just take care of the problem so i put in i have to

features it could just put the i mean that's what the cheating because you can detect pause pretty how about time and it depends
to different speakers even though there are huge speaker effect so
interrupts because they're just fewer interrupts and the robust meetings and
it's and i think john we have a long list of things he's starting to look at now over the summer where we can
and he'll be able to report on more things in the future but it was great
in the future but it was great that you can at least go from you know james transcripts and i recognize or output in to this point and
better in one sense talking mikes because the pitch processing that was done has much cleaner behavior than the switchboard telephone less
first of all the pitch track from have less having been doubling than switchboard and
may maybe you mean to tell we had tell from endless for switchboard and
right but all of these effects for like a couple percent
right but all of these effects for like a couple percent
and i think i agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things in their all that up and probably have a competitive system but i
so i think that's the real power but i wouldn't expect huge and

erie we started recording
me that we can talk about
to the ones who had been put in a lot of hours up to this point and there continue putting a lot of was wonderful
for the new ones with the tighter boundaries
now there was a good so a couple
as long as we have a record i the original automatic when you can always find out how we would do in recognition side by using those boundaries
but let me put it another sort of milestone as i did with the the pipeline
we are going to have to start a meeting in the middle of july
smile heads thing
anyway have what we've gone down the steps a number of times i know this can lead to extended conversations they're not really get anywhere so the latest that have men and a lot of meeting
yes anywhere so the latest suggests that offline that the people involved figure it out and take care of it before so i

that was separate from the interface do you remember
just get together and even the good thing is it since you have high recall even if you look for session because they're over generating that's good because
that's good because we could train noise models and recognize it for these kinds of transients and things that come from the microphone but
you see the crime carmen i forget
i mean they're all different databases and different you know any c. k. and all that so it
but my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but i didn't make it worse

and then i'll give it to brian in they can try that out when we get that
that out when we get that back we'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with too many beats in the last transcription
these things and she was saying the short patterns is of the you know
and no we had mentioned it to us we're getting like
that's what we're seeing in other areas
so we but we may not i mean if it doesn't perform as we may not know why i because we need

maybe even three
so we the transcribers of continued to work past what i'm calling set one which was
of words and the rest of the month on the average not exactly but it
so the thing is do we expect at this
at this point i'm ass i'm you know i'm wondering is it can we expect to tennis and to do better than that properly trained you know a godson system trying to like you know in the future is with you know the rights choices parameters that's
kind of that's and so then you have to use all fifty six of the guilty

they before we do the meeting to organized thing maybe you could say relevant about where inscriptions
my fellow was one point five percent one was point eight
you probably maybe another half percent if you do the detail and training
it was there was one thing that was on a half percent was play
and but h. p. s. you know when you put a number after it he's instead of it's about safety of finding honesty
frankly we never did that with the ross of filter either so

notice my thing i could hire additional people my age too
and not and they wouldn't have been funders if it'd been this other word you know
if they've to that i forget how we end right i figure
something like that and i mean i would say no like i don't want to know but some people might
but some people might be really interested and then in other
i think have you tried using this time as opposed to the number of words in doing is

so jane in adam and i had a meeting where we talked about the reorganization of the directory structure for all of the meeting just recorded
for all the media recorded it
and so we've got a plan for what we're going to do their and then
their and then jane also prepared a started getting all of the meetings organized so she prepared a spreadsheet which i spent the last couple of days adding too
that's another interesting thing the average number of speakers from meeting is six
about was so then the first experiment that he did we just took the whole fifty six outputs and that's

so i think what it is that the thing that they sign i look at in a while but it has to be open enough that sort of says from now on you know now that i've read this you can use do anything you want with these data
and but i think we wanted so
right but roughly speaking to recognize where they're going to give you a similar type of position either early
right they give the number of words and either early or late not
and i never put anything in to adjust it for different sampling rates
much and part of what i do is real power of it is that there's your transformation capability for taking all sorts of different while to things that we do not just

channel there's a battery
i came up here and just recorded the numbers one through ten
so they really appreciate i was going to say that
and it actually talks and she did
and you don't you there's no way we're going to go back and ask everybody do you approve this you know this document now so

yes and i mean it actually it might be good too have them separately and have the same in fact strings i mean
i mean could use them for an online thing or something but
like the fastest one so he just cut those out and splice them in between two beats
a reasons but if we hire you know we have five on staff five or six times at any given time then it's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way
yes done ready they'll i so that in july we can tell people yes we have this and you can use it

i've got a couple of things to talk about he's ill so
i b. and and just getting meeting information organized be
because if the idea of a thing comes through really quickly then we would want to have to but you know lay people off and so
this way and i got really a lot of response for my notice my thing i could
and to use them for training at all for whatever you have to

one which was accepted and talking about this point but they've gotten
but they've gotten five meetings done in that set
right now they're in the process of being edited
they disappeared from view
anyway i agree that at some point people i won't care about typos but they would care about significant meaning changes and then

a lot of was wonderful an excellent work and so
and so then in addition i hired two more today and i'm planning to hire a third one with this within this coming week but
it should we go through and do the business is of having the participants approve it for proves the transcriptionist for description and so forth
it just shitty in principle
like there's a lot of different features it could just put the i mean that's what the cheating because

it you out there's a point at which i agree it becomes ridiculous because you know you could do
because you know you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say you know that should be a period not a question are right
how about having an improved the only enough to try
that and so this is all they kill a person so
he made the primer i don't know if stan fixed it or

that it was the trash can he wanted
simpler if we could count on listening listen to hours
don't enough that was in the i mean time position
don't enough that was in the start i mean time position relative to the beginning of the heart
that we do not just the standard friend and but other

you know talk and i talked and the next thing to do was probably too and the size of the cussing system to this feature factor which we have not at all just
know each makes has ten thousands and were you in sixty
at that point we're pretty new i didn't we
and that's compared to a thirty nine input feature victor either m. s. is here p. l. p.
but one thing we could do is i mean just definite

going on this got a month left
just we got you got it is for a bunch of no
that was all previously here
and the transcriber thought that the easiest thing for them would be if there was a beep and then i and number digit and then a beep at the beginning of each one and that would help

i just because i didn't have any more digit she
so just getting better signals and in the state
anyway down's been doing a great job and i hope to
job and i hope to continuous under is health and also some of appeals help us

we have to train
pre i think it's we get like a chorus
but it's not but they just with age kind
the reason i'm asking is because it and i've just been talking and she's just been doing a you know for their hiring of transcribers and so

is their that's happened about that's right recognize or et cetera this things that were
this coming week but the plan is as more of the same we discussed this and the plan right now is to keep the staff on the leave your side you know rather
you know rather than hiring like eight to ten right now because if
use should use i. d.'s or something

where'd you get the digits beeps and so we're i came up
sounds like a radio announcers voice really funny
what are we handling i mean we should have you record a p. c. for
but from such a reasons but

i mean particular i would really hope that when we do to start meeting in july that we sort of have we're into production mode somehow that we
how about time position normalize by speaking and it depends on speaking right see great
by speaking see great yes use
for our so we can run lots of he this brute force try

everything and i was taking the position of having it be really straight for people to check every aspect of it including the audio
i don't remember who won me that
if it's only the transcript though i mean this is my point that i that's i bring this
my point that then it becomes i that's i bring this up again because i can't remember how we ended up that it

so these are based on some alignment word features
word features like word frequency and whether
so the dominant features including everything so we're starting to see i think some interesting
so the dominant features including everything where those and she thinks right interesting

and anything there too as i tried some putting the speaker so
same scale but that but any individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place so that's why did that too
pretty new i didn't we never really like looked at it on the screen and
what he did fix it and then and it's taken care of sampling right which is great

what's channel and my
and my travel too makes you turn your microphone
we were going to do a mock up like question answering or something

i saw her earlier here
you slice them into the
i think would be interesting to combine these

some public she can just walk in i
i remember
using the what factors that we considered for this price i'm just applying that's pretty

actually looks like it's getting better
but it's not but they just with age kind
so but the part that's actually adjustment of the front and per se as opposed to doing putting be vienna or something is it was couple so it was

we should consider doing some out so we do need some kind of presented
can grading exams
there is that there is one problem with and that's when they start partway through than what i do is i merge what they've done with these pre segmented version so it's not that would be great to have to know that and be good

right now they're discreet yes or no for
and i remember how we ended up i
mean with the web interface it's interesting because you could allow the person who signs to be in forums when they're transcript changes or

in january and so it makes sense it
given that we've been we've given a couple public talks about her ready space by months and months i think to be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available
will certainly be done by then right suing

but they're really solid we're really lucky the two that we kept and
kept and i mean if he can't see it i mean is we got a good good car
see this is the issue subtleties of the meeting it's changes clarifying question

in today's event that they actually don's i bet we could find some other for them to do so
because we couldn't use the non native all non native meetings and
now the thing is in some databases i wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you much and part

that was something that i planned working on this to use so the transcripts of a child done by now and to use them for the new ones with the tighter boundaries
a good so a couple of weeks ago i needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time he was on he occasion for
occasion for just very few days you were way they happen

it's actually a record of where they change i mean you can
that easy but i think one can do that i mean if we keep the old copy of the
how about time position normalize by speaking and it depends on speaking right see great

at first but we one interesting things was
i you reported on some cat punctuation type finding
which i really feel like saying in quotes because

and a neat thing even though
that probably do better than i wasn't generalizing so
he made a parameter so

than switchboard and there's a lot less dropouts so if you
so if you ask how many regions where you would normally expect somebody else to be occurring are completely devoid of pitch information other was a pitched
other was a pitched record just to get a high enough probability of voicing for words for

five where that much fewer than in switch so the missing
so the missing we had a big missing data problem in switchboard
and so the features weren't as reliable because they were often

so high that's not that's not the problem so that's not the problem
so that it's a relative
differences and that but i my point was that hybrid system thing we did was primitive and anyway

and all of them my fellow was one point
it's called h. p. s. want the
p. s. and but h. p. the safety of finding honesty

so one thing we were wondering is if we did principal components and say took out just thirteen and then did deltas in double deltas on that so
deltas on that so we treated this verse thirteen as though they were standard features i mean today
but again given all these differences maybe it's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these little variants components

is one thing but i thought there was a second thing
so we should just get together and even the good thing

i was reading the digits and i realize that could xerox
because i didn't want people to turn their heads from these microphone so

we way have the same digit form for the record
so the choice is which we want more the of the comparison a @reject@ racing it's the same time that's just because i didn't have

not that's not security related to me that we can talk about
you'll be provided trances when they're i think

just have to take the reciprocal so you just need to copy over to this one
but i know that if we run recognition on constrained on the whole way form we do very poorly because we're getting in persons in places but that you may becoming out so we do

and so now with the segments are working so i think we should consider doing
it you think we should increase the

we should consider doing some extra things like no retraining are adapting was for background noise to the to this need some kind of presented and
and using t. those you know plus carriers of some kind or right now they're

truck chunks
and so he talks over the transcriber and the transcriber thought

each one and that would help keep them from getting lost
where'd and so adam little script to generate those style beeps and so

good the sound of that's a great idea
and so we don't sort of really no exactly what they're doing and how long are we doing and so forth because

so we were going to send him one more sample meeting
meeting and to does run his segment asian adam's

his segment asian adam's going to generate jump file and then
by then right suing just we want to be able to say here is a subset that is available right now

to do what do you have any idea to turn around and on the steps are just
are so hard on our side or including

or including can grading
things because we you know we presented is possibly a month project back in january and

one of them had never plan to work past january nieces all these various
nieces all these various things because we you know we presented

event and since we're so far from this it's a little hard to i am this way in the unlikely
and that's just been through the legal issues and so forth so

he won so i started the monday non pre segment and then switch similar to yours and
to yours and they you know they always appreciate that when they have it available and

it's even when they create new new segments or something and will be not that easy but
there is that would be great to have old time x. just so that if we run it we know whether we're which ones were cheating and

that there is one problem with and that's when they to know that and be good
version so it's not a pure conditions with what

pure conditions with what you really like is that they started with preset mentioned we're the always through and
wasn't possible for about four the recent ones

future because we were
if you need someone to record this meeting unhappy to for the transcribers

you know a completely non cheating
but the i mean the editing will continue i'm only if there was a found they will be fixed but they won't it and

i've got to get smart permission from jane because i have some
from jane because i have some gaps here that i need to get her to fill in but so

of that's what i talk to jane about figure out exactly which ones have been completed and so forth
but this'll be a thing that we can put up on the the website and people can be informed of the status of various different ones and they'll also lists

in and there's a place for comments so we can say why we're excluding things and so forth now
and so forth now with the ones that are ready transcribes we have enough there that you know we've

that you know we've very done some studies and so forth and
in the middle of july and i think you could be given that

trying to converted over to the master file see being the channel ice person it's
ice person it's it seems like i get into a certain way and then something else entertain i have to stop cleaning

up these things like the the places where the transcriber was uncertain and
uncertain and doing spot checking here and there so

so i it would make sense to till the that's done
but let me put it another

i agree i so assuming that it's that kind of wording i don't remember i think we just want to have it enough confidence ourselves that it's so close to the final form it's going to be in a year from now that they're
agree it's just a question of if the person is using the transcript is the way of them judging what they said the weather was funders then it seems like it's it needs to be more correct than if we could count on them relive thing to the meeting

decided you are whispering and then in other words they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that
decided you are whispering satanic incantations under your breath when you're typos and things like that

simpler if we could count on listening that's we just have to listen to hours and hours of
that's we just have to and hours of

unfortunately in the same thing they signed it says transcripts you'll be provided problem i'm serious i
you'll be provided trances when they're ill i think that's a

and or written version so that was
deep guilty teachers work you know continue to improve

yes use at first but we
that's one experiment we should probably need to do though and at some point is since we're using that same than that was trained on kelpie without all these things and it's for the tandem system we may want to go back and re train

the speaker so i gave everybody a short version of their names of the real names
names of the real names are in there which we couldn't

the but the mean limitation now is like because we're only looking at things that happen every ten words or every twenty words we need more data more data per speaker
one experiment a little more but sort of four

better in one sense less
i know we have another person with the detail eight that's three

i tried that attitude
be way off and get very poorly trained you know got since that way

so i ran one experimental where we just that book protect our normalization only in the test data so
data so i didn't bother to retrain the months at all

and to prove by one percent which is about what we got
which is about what we got to with you know just actually doing both training and test normalization with the standard system so

it looks like the peel feet teachers do very with after having figured out all these little tricks to get it or
so you mean you improve one percent over the system that doesn't have any detail in it already

and then interesting if you optimize you've got more wind out of restoring in bestest enough
enough to my thing the way it's i mean

same scale but that but why did that too
so that's why i wanted to look so

for something and it was twenty percent which
but it should at least be roughly the same and maybe a little better if it seemed like way

that was combined with the triangular right other thing
those two were together we were able to separate

right we were able to separate boxes or one
and no we had mentioned it to us

it's you know no big deal it's you could
deal it's you could have ten twenty thirty knows whatever and

they kill a person so it was a forty five hertz instead of ninety so
ninety so i

which is another helpful but you're fine
so that was the problem there was a we had always intended to cut off a hundred hertz and just

friend and but other things like with multiple streams and so forth analyze you
analyze you feed into the other system was this through this funnel

we could do is i mean just definite you say take the fifty
yes there's regular you say take the fifty thousand these are the pretty finding on one they're ready outputs and

talk with seven
he gets and things like that you see the crime

channel five they just can

camera so whatever i'm in

camera one camera too when a man the floor

sort of a diesel

that's that seems better that

up and we're starting late i figured we'd better to start

i was going to ask and to say if you thought anymore about the demo

occurred to me that this is like man proper meetings in mid july

member like asking questions and retreating but in a pre stored fashion

that was the thing we talked but i think before the transcriber

but somebody going on this

i we'll see thing or something but it of course goes more quickly doing him in unison i don't know

it i it's depending on how see how long go

it i it's depending on how see how long go

i've got a couple animation tries to put this together but he's ill so

meeting info organized

are you implying that currently disorganized in

this things that were happening before with

you guys are doing much experiments with different fun ands and then that's

we're improve and then that's is that still sort of where was that day

now the you saw the note that t. l. p. now is getting the same as m. s. c. right

it seems it looks i haven't the summer and still not complete but

it looks like the put attracted some investments working goes

but one issue actually

but one issue actually that just came up in discussion with lives and on was as far as meeting recognitions concerned we would really like to move to doing the recognition on automatic technician

it you think we should increase the air raid good

that's what i wanted to do it anyway so we should

yes or no for speaker too consider those particular speaker back background all

so the rest of the interesting things that could be done

so the could be done

so when we do the idea and

so talked with brian and gave him the alternatives to the single beep at the end of each other instead we had generated before and so and some they

it sounds really good the sound that's a great

he recorded three he did he die recorded actually i recorded one through ten three times in three different speeds and then he picked like the fastest

what are we handling i mean we should have you record a

she said it wasn't going to the transcriber said it wouldn't be a problem because they can actually make a template that has beep number beep so for them it'll be

so for them it'll be very quick

to put those in there and the transcribing

that's just the i b. m. side arthritis

side arthritis quick i mean

should be finished today or something that's the overall thing the reason i'm

should be finished today or something that's the overall thing the reason i'm

and so forth because right now she has no choice but to operate in the mode that we already have working and

i so it'd be good to sort of get that resolved since because couldn't

i i hope we can get a better estimate from this one that we send them since because couldn't

i don't know yet no

print i think that would certainly be a very good thing now

i hired two transcribers today thinking of hiring another one which will because

and that will bring our total too they die

know one of them really wasn't planning that was about unforeseen side effect

but still i mean it's just a matter of we're we've got no back meeting

and the other thing is i mean in the unlikely event and since we're

this way in the unlikely event that we actually find that we have transcribers on staff were twiddling their thumbs because you know there's

yes for them to do so i think that eight as we're talking if we heard twelve then we could you know rent a problem later i mean we

problem later i mean we also just couldn't sustain that forever but

it'd be great to this we can we might need some help again getting the tighter boundaries or some hand

or some hand to experiment with you'd have a ground truth for this segment haitian work which i

haitian work which i you have some already that was really helpful and probably is more

and with the tighter boundaries

you have to create some speech non speech label follows them

and but that's the thing was so one time just looking into it

you were way they happen to be during that time and he won so i

have it available and he's usually so they really appreciate

you it i talked to them

and so i asked her i mean they're very

her i mean they're very perceptive i really want to

perceptive i really want to have this meeting up transcribes i haven't

up transcribes i haven't done it yet but i want to do that and

want to do that and she's out of town for a couple of weeks but i want to do that when she returns

because she was saying you know what i in a span a very short term yes it seems like the ones that need to be just are these things and she was saying

you could do it's on the just so that we new

could do it's complicated in that it's even when they create new

i think one can do that i mean if we keep the old copy of the old time x. just

there is that there is one problem that would be great to have to know that and be good

i could do it or chuck

so i went through all of the data that we have collected so far and have been

that we can keep people update about what's going on great

in but so far has of monday the fourteenth we've had a total number of meetings sixty two hours of meetings that we've collected and

and i'm going to have on here the total amount it's been transcribed so far but i've got a bunch

so far but i've got a bunch of that's

and they'll also lists like under the status if it's at i. b. m. or if it's a dixie or if it's completed or which ones were excluding in and there's

but the i mean in principle yes but i mean if somebody actually did get in some legal issue with it and

but they won't change the content of the meeting content

the thing too is there can be subtleties were person uses this word instead of that word which could have been transcribed the other way and

because it becomes in a way of legal documents if they've i forget how we

it's just the audio to do web interface that would make it

they disappeared from view like can sort of say that anything's that are deemed

changes and then they could be asked for their consent i if those change because of some of

change because of some of this i mean we don't really distribute things that have any significant changes from what they assign anyway

unfortunately we just have to give them a chance to listen to it and if they don't that's their problem

done ready they'll yes we have this and you can

to that the part about his project in class and

native meetings and it's probably below specials on enough data for us for the things we're looking at because the

and we're hoping that maybe with i don't know double or triple the date it was twenty meetings or so that we would start to get better results but

better results but we did find that some of the features that i get jane would know about that are expressing sort of the distance of boundaries from peaks in yet or and some local range pitch range effects like how close people are to their floor are showing up and he's classifies

sometimes not it depends what you're looking

sometimes not sometimes it depends what you're looking at actually

sports is not cheating except that of course you know the real words but roughly speaking

right they give the number either early or late

the rest of the month on the average it it should be

the rest of the month on the average it it should be

have you tried using this time and actually that's one of the things we're interested in doing is

just competition like when i went starts start

they probably things into like of the heart try it but it's

they probably things into of the heart try it but it's

a neat thing even though the word features were available

and those don't show up

so that means that overall it wasn't just modeling morgan or it wasn't just smiling single person

but was sort of trying to i get a general idea them model

idea them model the tree class very strange to find general locations that were applicable to different speakers even

whether you are in now meeting recorder meeting were real buses meeting did matter interrupts because

so but classify learns more about morgan than it does about sort of the average person which

average person which not that probably do

better in one sense switchboard telephone less

could have reliable because they were often just not available so that's actually

and we had the i'm annoying sort of telephone handset movement problem that i think they also affected

bit right it's number of

they were higher number of conditions actually

so you so actually it's prefer to have positive or negative some fishing which means deletion

which means

but you know given that murderous so high that's not that's not the problem so that's that's not the problem

though but at least just

not at all just the same configuration that's a used for the standard system and

the standard system and for instance then to send me a message saying that seem you used something like ten thousand for cluster

four so that's a big difference and might

difference and might be way off and

and put train extra weight so

brute force try a whole bunch of different settings and with

and with the new machines

so in the few hours will have the numbers for retraining everything with we're tracking from position so

position so that might be improved further so

detail in it already

right so and then we'll have our baseline to compare the currently hideous new things but

because it was trained on you know was used did not find which didn't have any

but if you add them up

that's three point three

actually and that's point three

i mean then then you do with the standard

so and but she's i remember

but she's i remember they were one of them

they were one of them was to change to because it does it all at to affirm bark scale to mel scale which i

quotes because they're essentially the same scale but that why did that

other it could be something more fundamental but it you know

right boxes or one thing but then there was a point eight

the low thing but then there was a point eight percent was something else remember

so that was that when i can claim credit for in terms of screen up in the first place so someone

place so someone of some of six that

which is that i never played when i we

i we had some problems before with offsets this if this went back

everybody else who was doing wall street journal knew that they were big d. c. offices in the state and and no

we're getting like really terrible results like two three times a year

like two three times a year everybody else is getting and then

and then in casual conversation on matched mentioned i you know course you're taking care of the offset this what

it on the screen and then we screen and we

just big d. c. offset so

so in peel p. there was up like a or something

in peel p. no it's there was up like a or something or when they recorded or just

no it's it's not at all uncommon for record electronics to have different d. c. offsets it's or just

knows whatever and it's consistently in that's

the thing is most people's front and have free emphasis but it was or it's or frequency

but was guilty we didn't actually have that we had we

that we had the equivalent of preemptive says and i a what you're months and style waiting that occurs in the middle of peel p.

p. it doesn't actually have a zero eight zero frequency like

frequency like the typical simple parenthesis that's we have something

so i put in i have to filter that i think ninety hurts are so for sixteen killer stamping

he made the primer he

what is the parameters which is great

it's is the parameters is just the lower cut off that you want

of filter either so the rest of filters actually doing a different thing in the much licensor because the main depending what's happened redoing which is

that had that help despite like it cancer percent

but @reject@ again after completing heard experiment so we can add up all the differences and but

differences and that but i my point was that

system but i think not that much of it is due to the front and per se i think

and per se i think maybe a couple of percent of it is as far as i can see from this unless

if it seemed like way worse

yes there's regular tandem outputs through the and through the kale too

tandem outputs through the l. all that through the kale too

i mean today and do experiments like that
