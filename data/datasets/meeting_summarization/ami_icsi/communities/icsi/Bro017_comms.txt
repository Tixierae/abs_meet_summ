because it was for the first time i'd be on a friend city as the outcome but it does
and i so what a big surprise i mean equal to that it and then four months able we could've didn't because nobody i suppose bringing it up would be if they could
it up would be if they could have didn't want you to this information either because we were working right
and of course but it's not working on c. h. s. greedy
so or we have to do something about it and in principle i
because body
that our argument with everybody i is access to our cold everybody always had access to local they never
but i somehow seem that it wouldn't be so bad as people are happy about that i want to say about it and i think they have to be
doing up to the i went go around the used to be i'll to around and then you outdoor bulletins but i it seems so
that box it seems it he's
discuss that and everybody's all be discussed that in u. n. or to me they're not so what
the question is all soya have these agree this is boots too it to the of the the criterion
i think local me is the same maybe shouldn't have been in the fifty percent yet you should at least
you should at least try once again i'm more around so this
that's what that's like matched in media mismatch
now they went to they should have criteria criterion is and i think that is his right
so this is where it is sort of i believe
beach would be a more robust annoys and so far enough much
and so far enough much success he tried
it was kind of like one of these things you know like if you think about it six
the truth is so you get many decisions but you have many of those sectors are funny right
so you get many decisions are funny right
and they said that some reason for it because
and now we are trying to understand what does that affect their presence
for instance question is like how correlate it odd that i'm so
that's how they ach like all right it because i mean especially the neighboring once like they did at present
like they did at present the same almost the same point people ration of the local talk so there's a
so there's a very high quantities so
bands you need at least so you need
me but also if you out making decisions what's happening at like you know if you want to know what's happening in nine hundred hertz and it and maybe at eleven hundred or study you don't much
really it's sort of like saying that what's happening at one killer hurts depends on what's happening around it sort of relative
so for instance if you'd if you add the noise that normally masks mosque with the signal
i glad this noise is more like give them life is
from here so you have a no noise then you like spending the particular bands so we amount of mocking increasing
and then you it's at the point that you said because the club and then the amount of mocking is the same
so that's the famous experimental such a long time ago
like five cities of course
like five cities of course the promised to do this on they're or program but you probably won't have
whiny he get the mosque this
the when is the next evaluation june or
and i thought that i can get you can get together are people
benefits took twenty two persons better than old baseline you don't have
instilled told me david the yesterday or heidi so you go to howdy from cork on then how do jen
on then how do you brought up a suggestion diesel fuel for fifty percent
just i you and there that you all system does only it's eighty percent comparing to and pointed the baseline so they must have run
but he was hoping to work that takes and like on talking basis but right now he's
but maybe i mean we're not too far from fifty person and then you been
i think it's a bother right depends on the way things
what was you guys working on my sleep
any we've not finished at this
general up all power in someone
up all power if you take this power of tool a square root or something so suppose
so suppose that you out working with this see we'll easy if you want
so you these coefficients always becoming less efficient right of that
everything the sixties and
important so that's the that's a painful on so
you don't have to leave training so if you instead of
you multiply the standard deviation so it's i seen that you might you're
bought you conduit in it that they that because you
but if you have if you want to around the x. expensive experiment experimentally doubt training the more they'll you don't have to be trained him and you training
by the same amount to if you want to try an experiment by leaving out say see one couldn't you in your test data modify d. all of the c. one values to be way outside of the normal range of the gals n. foresee one that was trained in the model so that
now that would be very would match right
look but just from me so
i see what do i say saying back i
because it would be a relief feuding with the daytime yukon with it
i'm reasonably close it and end up putting on the record i mean these
but i think it's it's very and she's on and did i mean it turned and gosham aggression so i think
train your mother on these teachers
just to know in that is a simple thing you could just muck with the variance
just to know in just muck with the variance
to get this the effect i think that you're talking about right
sharper the variance the more important to get that one right you know actually
get that one right you know actually this reminds me of something that happened when i was a b. n. we were playing with
easily i think and you have a whole bunch of
and doing good the discussion there was this guy who was so busy thing that i sit there and on the computer
nobody was looking you in order scotty got the have you ever seen
so you could look that up so that they hit the keyboard
to i knew some people who where it was in all communist physical so lucky i so the but

so i what we do we just sort of go around and people say what's going on what's the latest
saddam meet being which was kind of interesting because it
to local they never was a very good dean i did for
true i mean you know it might be that people that take the guy with worked five ten use the blocks from that's but i somehow seem
don't see the problem the biggest problem of course is that the docket that's instead of calm before the claims before filled the conditions the are
essentially that somebody videos and pointed eight subway some clean speech because
clean speech because most of these this because god has the most local close coasting mike and bush would be provided
but i it seems so because i be able
because i be able to fight for the treaty that
and nobody can didn't achieve fifty percent improvement so
and so last time of doing the maintained i just brought up the show so what you
that's been maybe you should discuss that and everybody's
i hold that i hold this is going to be out i'd update the
he tried sings reach a long time ago bill bands suggested
but they can you just they kill spectrum and man and he used to whatever they is coming from a fifty at gone stunt
aw you don't know about that what is that
that i mean not that sounds familiar i
that it's just familial familiar accident because they gave me the name but
essentially at a p. c. mac it's cruel but everything is stocked with across life
that's another how wide or the frequency
bach or do they taste observation is that you ob you out you can get quite a big advantage of using who could pick the bands at the same time
time but what's the number is it just
kind of question is can you describe i'm insult is that the bible she industry vicious or to what extent
least so you need somebody that they've not beef relation
or study you don't much care what's happening it's ridiculous so it's
ridiculous so it's really it's sort
much more so if you are far away from the signal so i think enough that frequency that it just it really is then the even then the nicest going away did it's not having much
you know that you probably won't have anything before the next time we have to evaluate
close you don't know any better yet then to use the u. n. the fires and it's in a trap
that and help goshen
so this is so what's happening then really is
then really is the cost me for about a month vacation and
so he's in india
i getting married or something
and he's very pretty any of that
cathartic by there the a year
and such you need to get out the very first because he's you already has a four years surf so
it's about nobody even set up yet the date for their learning to and pointed daytime
why shouldn't be i don't see i should be working
it gets to the sort of improvement hell comedy because you don't
hell comedy because you don't see it on a on the oil and pointed state i
and pointed state i think so i you could even better goes like
i think so goes like the security up that they chose to something that chicken kits using jedi nine months with the speech recognition system and
i on clean species bad they've instilled told me david the yesterday system and only got i meant on the clean channel and and i @reject@ jen
knowledge everybody i see what you guys might must be out of your mind
right and so by making
by making a narrower
conduit you've got you've got shot got yukon with it i that's true right have you have
on the record i mean these people to listen to it for centuries now is what
now you're you're changing that by square ing it now you're mean
it now you're mean of your c. one original data has it's four but
your model still has i mean it's too
i think when i see what could be done east you don't change your creatures chuck computed once wrong
did you say you got these h. t. k.'s set up on the new linux boxes that's right in fact
and it's like you said if an easy fishing for a whole that's right in fact and they're just the right now they're installing increasing the memory on that
too difficult to try maybe i could set that up

seem to everybody said this is not saturday didn't know that and
and in principle i v. b. agree
because they so they now decided that is the whole thing would be down about point today
and and they almost on that except that it wasn't a hundred percent and so last
insanity tossing on all these you to do something that's been maybe you should
bodies should happen at the point where everybody peace corps what's i would needed or would be quote
exactly i think that this test loss that of bogus because it doesn't they a and
and essentially there were as hobby trudy decisions made and everything so
so we are looking you know ways he's in the choose the chicken prolife the better any show that's the metal demo specs through music
right because he already had the noise in
and it also working at the time it was kind of like one of
you can talk to classify based on that
puppies you don't know much about it
and then you can stops this thinking aloud to call my niece decisions so
niece decisions so exactly that's what it that's what it is
that's a lighter i think that's really bans each of such a talks about the odd about stupid because bands you need at
so things like the see i kind of playing with and i the whole and perhaps because eventually use this in the you know the like a like
that the work each should study by smoking at now trying to find out what could we do is texas so that doesn't seem to go see them pacifier would be happier
the work each should study by
what the what extended quotient occupies should be on happy that and
i on clean system and only got i meant
so if you put it in this square roots that's activity makes feel more they'll hospice efficient
everything the sixties and this is something that you would adjust for training her only recognition
you just market i what if i did go she'll you know more they about if you instead of altering the future actors themselves you modify the galaxy stands in the model
you know in the past they tell you would have to put it in the pollard but
it in the pollard but you know in the training what you call it the training in train one male or you would have to do is to market by i appropriate constant
be costing the testing that it as they tell you cut them without you have
so you future your futuristic train your
you would have to mortified i mean you know what you like we need
and then do a whole bunch of those
could be set up fairly easily i think and
and it's like you said if an easy fishing for a whole to keep is going to be at the busy on that
that's right that's that's it would seem because then that and two gigs a memory
about it was reported to me that to somebody busy to the company
the they had that they had to the money there that i had the time on the computer how much time is being spent i are on the on this take other projects how idle time
order scotty got the have you ever seen those little
it's this thing that the shape of a burden has a red ball and it's beak dips into the water
that would be similar that's an interesting experiment
that would be similar to i knew
i so the but what you why american airplanes coming to spy on us the time
know one day there was no that these

and so i seen that's good common estefan report they don't in the i'm saddam meet being which
because that have going was saying no now everybody has access to all quote so
by way so i also that there was already decided house a year ago and
trucks and then no you haven't tried that yet
no not much or even tried that yet
he needed or anything but they can you just they
wince you have to send you keep shifting the thing on of other around so you can say
i it may be looking for together for fourth i did it i don't off married or something
know there's not enough time not in the did that he came back and then getting right i mean
in session remediation it's more the even get out if it musically what i find out if the importance of various but i'm at this
the only so of course program is that there's infinite number of combinations and if the
right that bad i mean you compute the features once right
aggression so i think maybe just country if you want
yes right yes exactly if you want to degrees importance of army terms u. s. too increased parents that
a really i wouldn't be too difficult to try maybe

because they beat says you know we because money purely this number by choosing the right late anyways so what
that argument there was that b. c. if it's the peaks of the spectrum so and maybe make you more robust annoys
actor it doesn't hurt has no effect
hey is this in the baseline her in
costs you it'll go she an extra month all
more mobilization he was saying what you did this might be the doctor not the way how to play with it hotshot in
nobles you would have to do
you have to doable both we do it on both sees actually
bought by later i mean it you may not need try it would require training and recognition
it you may not need three a train them without
right and so by making the standard deviation narrower your scores get worse for unless it's exactly
that they do i would i know so we were getting when we did clustering we were getting groups of features

so i it worked maybe a reasonably safe i is it says make a report on what's happening in all right you know at least what it from my perspective latest that would be great
it's i mean i'm being zero is around and number time but what's the number
there's glossy fire species use the diving local audience matrix on like it's
so he's thinking about the core eighteen
and hand and so on so i mean
that and then now the issue is how many with this you should be using i
some homemade arbitrary decision yes
b. n. we were playing with putting pitch into thee mandarin recognize or
and this particular pitch algorithm when it didn't think there was any voicing was spitting out zeros so

and it seemed like there were still some issues right that they were
whole vs today got they said i mean the the base i know go up and nobody
however there is only ten fifty nine so people kind of even you know about this state so i
if of course if you put this zero the they zero on them is one issue ohio hiding it's today and then you done
one unemployable about respect so that
now is kind of like young faculty
hard hardworking so he though he's so he's looking into that
bearnaise jason adjacent and
and you look on percy all they don bikes square

and in so you cautious i'm so it's a very different
get older it's an expense i yes just the amount of energy in that band from in that time interval
moment to provide the noise and neighboring physical that so
much i mean you think that it if you didn't say that off work is let's see half of the other things that you can try
so there's a little discussion now about this new criterion
you go you can go fishing exactly
so i for two hours this is what why i seem to sky sheets and
he's so you know me out being paid by compute get that i mean the if you have a government contracts and they
they had they say forty enough to where they had reported with a plan for improper but now the lying there so

he sat because
body in that case that you would like to change i've always been because
dean i did for the people are on a study if you call p. something and it just predicted protected by pop and then you negotiate or something right i mean if you find
and i think that is his mother rights relate
instead of using forty years spectrum from free time some form use the spectrum from b. d. c. mondale
or even i was thinking about looking back into these he had talks techniques for
so that makes it at any i didn't even noise that i said it i said effective right because i see
because if you around this area told me she you get that about any person they're that

to everybody but about we had a exponentially so i try and go to if there music a number of free
and pot so they maybe to till the fatally the searching
you know you need a little you like it's some kind of it
power exactly so if you whereabouts you'd have a genetic algorithm that tries random mutation
if you whereabouts so they i shouldn't say
like or they the idea
it's seen that you might keep i'd i
keep i'd i would've broken in a my i mean how

so it's really becoming minorities party a success
that would be can you just do that to the test they and not do anything with your training data
that would be very that because training data
that doing training q. you compress ceylon that becomes then it becomes less important you know training
by the same amount you also if you wanted to if
them as much right what are you up or house and know and
what i heard with i mean of zero and zero variance so

and be i agree i so what
and i think they have to be on the same home i'm because of eating the a again you know what would be available it would be a quote
maybe maze try some found out that sneaks like picked us trucks and then no you haven't tried that yet
so you have to really so he finally had some
so he finally had some incentive diminish
sort of in his motorcycle like those that puppy

like the most separation
to be happening this ice somehow stop the baby that's what's happening in the commission says
of it so you can you out quite capable of processing signal even at independent club individual medical benefits one mosque experiments
one mosque experiments tell you but at the same
but at the same time you would most likely pay attention to at least neighboring bands venue i making any decisions
and that's how you make the decisions

he got to get there right we are on fifty
that in a driving in the car but more than this morning they're discussing the to experiment fooled for beginning graduate student who wants to around of the from who wants to get a little number from something
chase like imagine that you live you will stop looking every any coefficients each values i mean you know that's in some general up all our
that this is the c. c.'s the lawn is going to be as many so open it's highly affected
that opposite this i race call finished it i thing is duty into h. a. h. d. case for reasons unknown to everybody but
but i run day there's in some way of doing this sarah say out searching faithful business going on

things then they said no because so everybody's in a light it however
like the didn't agency latency and things
didn't agency kind kids chops latency and things
didn't agency kind kids chops is acquire significant latency amount of processing close latency and things
so they for a very pressing lost that they would always around deck and out for a coke of and we could make a call this thing is upon seeing

and so then as everybody else's he should be needs to do i knew about elevation weed out voice activated so or we have
that right now and it's placebo that that you may get through that steve was to keep us and
doesn't matter it becomes more effective because she had a huge variance you're dividing by a large number either very small contribution
doesn't matter becomes more effective you're dividing by a large number either very

it he's our expediency is the only end pointing medic assume gets it gets you twenty one percent improvement overall instead of seventeen probing those beat up car
say this is a stocking that it's just
that it's just like short them spectrum something and now
says although it's very man's point to the fact that people can plates assuming to protect events

i know and then of course then what happened in not in was that he stopped she needed he needs to get a p. h. d. because they wouldn't give him his life
the figure that was that it he told me the day venice me to do any at the new seventies because the speaker commission that the clergy and he was you know lost their
cleavage is the worse than with various subjects and say you
you know that's that's it would absence we've got five processors on that

leave it i off the presentation of a driving home and he goes
we knew you were happy you know
so i says i said about so is he took another sequel was over the year but he was out so i
out so i wouldn't surprise me if he has a plan like that though propriety but still needs to get out first

a place like if it's a university professor and
and i'm not quite the university and it's quite to sort of smoked austin university but it's good school and he's happy
pickpockets experiment's but they do seem to do better be doing us
activity that's i exactly wider or narrower

so i it the problem is that i actually don't know how these hurt me because i had his they have any
they didn't here's who would that doesn't speak flexing anymore because he is mostly they phonetics
they phonetics and the main notes maybe draw from a or from horror opportunity because they have so many trouble so

because we were working on mainly on voice activated i think the full pasta seven months because that somebody right
the or a these that these people mortified medical that to account for these long silence is because
he's the c. i insisted he eventually can tell you how not that i'd be can get fifty percent improvement because

because that somebody gus the most seem to
check is configured inside trouble
that's an interesting idea actually

it a minute i thought being pointing really only helped in the noisy cases
but you have the same problem i e. c. has an enormous number of in sessions in
up the show so what you know the quite frankly i'd surprised how old is like the law making these decisions because

the like it now what is happening now is that i've seen that people try to match the criterion to solution they
but what's happening in the cold me but also if you
as said if it how did you come up in this number if you improve

and i saw that makes sense but still five econ get much my childhood
nobles training her only recognition
painful on bought by later i mean it you may not need so for each set of exponentially you would try it would require training and recognition

and then perhaps like we tried to find helpful or more they'll such it the spectrum because
and i so in that case why don't we just stop pressing neither do i'm inside and then causing all
causing all they see readily income and then people still doing them but matching into the in the seventies you agree and it's tearing apart it's like

i'm so it's a very different activated pamper puppies you don't know
but i mean it's if it's a club and band rights the amazing
absolute number doesn't tell you there i think you need to

on like four the frame by frame basis
matches so that's the way
a way to increase

to some extent it is also true to
true about five but for instance what human very much capable of doing is that if they are exactly the same thing happening into neighboring typical bands corporation can discard
true about five but

happening hey
i mean in the no but you're renting or it through that same model
match except that this component if you want to be hospice important you know in overall score

so the it must've been mosque and so normally it looks like certify aside from
aside from here so you
and you live put in up impress the this in a sense they by the same amount could you also if you wanted to if you want to try an experiment

that means that nobody will probably get to is it this improvement
it be the current system
i mean it was just you know incredibly high score and so that was throwing everything off

and body them but it's the media
cost of i'm so you compressing the range right of that
because the old serve that does high upon its as a more important than all work for a commission

you know just compress the whole sector
you just market i actors themselves you
be costing white if you're multiple if altering the model why would in the test data why would you have to muck would be kept surplus

know you need a little study good student sort of computing power it you'd have a genetic
exactly so mutation
this one maybe for somebody would be doing

what if i did go she'll you know more they about you know in the past stands in the model
this what you do when you'll mortified a standard deviation as you go straight
so that effectively the c. one never really contributes to the score

if you have a train and cynical you know more down you know the component beach is i mean they dimension to all of the mean and variance
go see what you off the thing is a mocking imaginable she tonight
it's it's as if is and i ninety mentions all had seen dimensions if you could you know the about

about but what are you multiply those are means
those are means right i mean
@reject@ yes so you just you're lying for less variance

they that because you don't have a fourth i mean the then that's comes what you can
comes what you can do it said you put this particular component in you compress it then
it then becomes they get so sweaty variance subsequently becomes less important

hello so what divorce from what to do whatever you say from
hello do whatever you say from now on it can be hard against us like that's

there's right that they were trying to decide
thirty percent person court you know

plenty of that i know issues but what happened was the daily liked voice activity actor
but what happened was the daily life as to where eating proposal speechless instead of call my cock out of us bulls that voice activated i think they're activity actor

right i mean if you find out technique useful viata very happy but
but i mean so what you want to do you want to say if you also something like the finals us to see you line it's not important you can do those things

decisions because this is a major decision for two years
decision for two years he off i can for five fifty percent improvement

so now officially milky eyes the complaining and said they are looking for support
smokey i was subjecting police the call comes easy to me support is that yes

next wednesday viata going through have and other than for the confidence think also see like goes
that i beat him about it obligation next meeting it or

of course people are the most the like it now
it to maybe that eventually

and then i'm also that it's no also and it's this tropical mission
this is physical mission from temple about them

and his ex there can be at this to lose some funny you
you can say it's i v. o. i would say that is access to it you know leo describe the funny much as in the center of the

so it's always so much better than johns
it's how do you convert this energy over time in a particular frequency band into a factor of numbers

give them life is more do late did the same with lisa frequency as the noise you the physical band amount of mocking his the moment
so but this is being not discuss that right now and

but if you go to fire in in of it if you if the noise is very broth you i'm be increasing much more so if you
log whereas good you're going

and since he didn't take any vacation for two years i had no i didn't have a hot to tell you know
insane off twenty percent of people

i on clean species only got i meant on the clean channel and
bad they've instilled told me david and i @reject@ jen

so they must have run or do something
and how they set much i mean you

we are on fifty sixty five so
is it as said if it how

it's not finished
sort of see how many cycles use

i thought i saw some jobs of years running on
right to be done some strange things like removing c. zero or she one from sector army turns

and we know did that see one once almost that's just what it can remove really
it can remove it from the actor it doesn't hurt really has no effect

so we were just discussing things you mention that in a driving
and you have to the greek you have a step where you

i mean the each have a lot of computing power
because it's the so it's it would be reasonable search

and had everything is fixed everything the sixties applied to that so and
without you have a only they talk

because the same city last thing i do feature is not important that's
that's important so that's

know it i what i'm proposing now we think is important import them as important you market by bike point on you know more now
unless it's exactly right on i mean

activity you know in front of them all the more they'll you put a constant
so activity what you're doing you see on what i find them though that the deviation

so you know it if you know to make the imagination leashes stefan sees and that's important i mean the most useful the important what you do is they do spectacle a coupon component in a more they'll you can occupied by the you can do you make it you know mondale bought you conduit
because the immortal strained expecting set the very infancy bonk

and because some of those things you see when it's important
pasta you train them although you sort of you couldn't do it you could do is that what i was proposing initially

you're likely would be lower right
because you would be providing c. v. n. as much what if you said

is what you can do is you train d'amato that we do a some they
so what you are doing is that it pump on and you know more they'll force ceylon you really dubai did a bike by tool

then used divided by four and you take a square of force it
then if you've seen this uncle is more than this more important than the that needs it then it's based on training then you that my people they cook on pointing them or they all by some of the standard deviation

market by go employer that it by the number of dodger than a lot of
and you put your they thought in power higher than on

if youre the original data foresee one had a mean of too
bad taste protest that's assumption about c. been i mean to begin with but then it was doesn't just

that's right seem because then you you just i could do whoops and then you pretend that you are working by gossiping you go you can go fishing and two gigs a memory exactly
that's right seem because then you you just i could and two gigs a memory

contracts and they pay us by the amount of compute that's kind if he gets
all day sunday so that it will be g. p. a. senate so to speak my gosh

so they worth three you guys the station in the middle of the woods some of on the only watching dollar fifty in my spending you and out there because it was this service like i
so they very quickly they made different you frenzied oakland goddess in local but people innovation

right to remain silent so i

had his they have any inform us that it's you speak to say what's going on and that's usually

sound good and it was sort of like everything was lying on the floor and it

there's plenty of that i know issues trying to decide liked voice

you apsos you're right i mean you see i've

i mean you see i've be said you provided the bed and pointed to the speech because the or a

silence is because otherwise that that was a court scene

always been because see are working four for eight daytime you probably do use it different set of takes

that unfortunately nobody ever officially caught somehow ignore he said this can be done

everybody to call you would need it

i think they're going to you know no there is philadelphia

to you know no there is philadelphia the streaks of each is so say i going to be perfect they send you guys who take them it's probably it's also true i mean

so that the people can go to call so what listen basis what you stole from me

it's nearly that so i don't see the problem the

the best of the out of found out

and i'm other people don't feel that because they

and viva iran against doing up to the

so they that that'd be a thirty five percent improvement a on the bad taste in bed day mismatch but a minute i thought being

in so now they want to say they'd be very five fifty percent blooming on before bottom explanation and only twenty five percent for this t. v.

not so what with a lot of people them and that because not everybody participates of these got qualified conferencing causes things then

so i badly and i thought it's to discuss that immediate

that immediate you know key raise the question is all soya have

so what about the issue of the weights on that for the different systems

that's what that's like very what's ballpoint because they beat says mismatch

a year ago so of and they're the staying the same

that eventually it may have it may they may have to happen

sort of i believe that o. g. i know is the working on our new should be i've seen that have it and they connected

techniques for instance that is consul plus the late too do you speeches and at mostly everything

i mean at add more they're the amount of noise or they don

if you think about it six davidian years is so

is so you know they got the spectrum and access to own stunt see to every everybody you're

you know they got the spectrum you're

exactly if you're making all your training a more uniform

and even if then knew that they that becomes noisy it becomes as effective because that's really sick

of course you would get out at too much noise because then you goes then new york a commission goes down but i mean it you yet

but i mean it you yet to be seen how much it's a very simple technique

it's a very simple technique

or the other thing is of course if you have a spectrum what you can stop doing you can he started eating out up the park city shot a all in energy

because help one more though there still tried to put them continuation all of the all the more they'll into these spots where she said to the year that's

said to the year that's what he wanted try i have

they gave me the name but what it is that normally what you do it said you nicest speech based on the salt respectful

so he's so given the spectrum me essentially oxide in science that sort of my own but it affected wince you have to send you

other around so you can say about you can also think that i'm such a philly of the as you have to give the frequency and

thing about the parents of the law maybe about all these eclectic event spectrum

for various reasons

hey jason bearnaise jason

for it because some of these in the second acapulco i was to tell you about things like masking experiments beach you could take of

and also like thirty minutes the my skin it's actually tell you that something is happening across could take offense at girls bands and

it's the time as you get older it's an expense i the just the amount of energy

you should be using i mean the so the minimum is long

then abandon now we are thinking of all too hopefully you had the neighboring banned because that seems to be happening this

venue i making any decisions you compare what's happening in this band to what's happening with the band to the neighboring bands and that's

absolute number

i think you need to compare it to something that's what's happening

to some extent it sort of relative to

beanie there's another one another's voice here

like you can show that in that is that if you add the noise outside could country club and that doesn't affect the decisions you making about the same i didn't think of that

i when people start thinking lot this is interesting so

box if you if you mostly the noise the mosque goals op and the moment you stop anything the and i looked at the cabana mosque skin goes down

so essentially that's a clear indication that coke nation can take into consideration was happening in the neighboring bands

maybe it most likely even though they have anything beach because able would comply to the rules

i know right i mean i've known other friends who they go to and they go back home to india for a month and come back married

i mean it's that i had a in san diego see how always had this but i think city they have authority so

next meeting it seems to in

together nobody said that yet are people supposed to rerun their system so

nobody said that yet i it so their system so

you have what i think would be of course extremely useful you'd be cooking come to linux meeting and say you know he did get fifty percent improvement

percent improvement because people if said be saying it's impossible

do you know what the new baseline is i if

benefits took twenty i if you don't have

i yes but i've seen using youre what's activities hectic

yes but i've seen that it be the similar i don't see the reason why shouldn't be i

because if he just use our voice activated it that you don't clean even that it's fun before it's just like one of them

log into authority he got the chill up or he was asking money for pasta years three years good you're going

he got the job some factually to have technical cody not to far from off in a place

but right now he's just it doesn't look like that to anybody that you see even thinking about speech accreditation thing go

beach avenge s. essentially i think that have you should be happy with because that

with because that would mean that these people that may be forced to milk into a into not to solutions

but not yes which would mean like sixty percent over the crime but i just

yes the crime but i just

number if you improve twenty but by twenty percent up to do this or the size it just it kind of click will come go i didn't exactly

i think it's a bother right depends on the way things in

how's your documentation or whatever what was you guys working

they don't even in my first time too proofing it isn't in some the smoke it something like that but

we took him that explaining pickpockets experiment's but they do seem to do better be doing us

so have you been running some new experiments i thought i saw

but it's the media next one whatever the cost of i'm so you're compressing the range right of that

it's highly affected by sequencer spawn so those recording equipment and that sort of thing

you know actually i don't know that this wouldn't be all that bad i mean you compute

and had everything and then these exponentially just applied to that so

you just may need to do is get fed isolate too and more it component of the mortgage the at present this particular teach

i mean in the no but you're renting or it through that

to you know it i what all of the mean and variance of the to see one you put into zero

to you know it i what of the to see one you put into zero

activity that's i exactly i think you i think you'd have to modify the standard deviation or something so that you make wider or narrower

the same mean right and so by making

@reject@ yes so you just you're lying for less variance

you making this particular dimension it's important

very that because they me immortal strained expecting that

and you training it's on the origin of it i

off to you there then you out green despotic study off importance if you want you'll they'll you see one component in a more though

are you up or house and know you don't do one that because that would and

as much what if you said it to the mean of the model

now that would be and it was a cost you set all see ones coming in through your test data you change whatever value was there too the mean that your model

he he said it too i mean that's would know you @reject@

you've got you've got shot got have you have

then you decide that you want to see how we bought some c. one is

then you would still have a perfect match except

or they all by some of the standard deviation

then it becomes more in one you know overall score i pity

so you felt so you may want to do the other way around that's right

so even though you expanded the range you're mean doesn't match anymore

but you just tune into muslim

and then you want to decrease the importance of she won you just take the browns she one component condoning the mother and increase it if you want to decrease the importance see one aren't treated

you like we need you

but i mean but it's it's the weather right i so

mean studies of a it's predictable

it's pretty it's predictable

it's pretty that is a simple

could it creates a variance to decrease the importance

that they do i would i know what i of features

so when andrew and when any time any one of those actors came in i had a zero and we got a great score i mean it was

so if you have a very small variance you get really good scores when you get something that matches

that's interesting

so in fact that would be

that doesn't require any retraining

no it's just turning the mother so that means it's just recognitions

turning the mother was and you have to it's just recognitions you have a step

and you have to the greek you have a step where you modify the models they could copy of your models with whatever variants modification jamaican rerun recognition and then

i see this on the record like i say one each company it was

so you had to make it look like

and that's about they was on planes flying over so always said that boss

and so they was the only work if they had they say

then the second thing said that they took the line from the so forced to local pop

and they were quoting from the pot any

any but that's seems like they made it and they screwed outfits i did they had put that the pop old enough to make a phone call baby me an about it would be that anymore

was no that these they wear so of snobby now that they look of the plane flying their right and

their right and bible unless is if somebody for cook quickly it pick becomes a phone call is it is place by you get so there

place by you get so playful pay for some reason it was a dollar dog there was a

so they got in trouble

a really i wouldn't be too difficult to try maybe
