that's horrible disincentive
their couples the
want so the couple again the bottom which is directed motion you might
you might need a nominal expression to take the place of you know the big you know the big tall dark man you know walked into the room
and then again spent the change here just my name's there was talk
about changing it to man take facts which
right now it's a construction type and meantime so
i mean we sort of thought we were getting away with i mean we don't mind either
i mean we sort of thought we were we don't mind either
at least in english to this which is the question was do we want directed motion which is an argument for
right of these that subject predicates or subject predicates get subject for bob you know roderick would require that those things that fault fills up an object our non expressions and that would be
robert's i have you
and sort of going with that is that the desert not them also now is a pair
build right we might want to introduce mental spaces you know that all these things
clearly not here by the way i do want right so it's going to be some extra and you know definitely other additionally to that which we skip for now
by the way i do want to get on that as soon as robert gets back so it
right it's often thought of as is also considered a mental space you know by
you know where is could actually depending what right
that if we do the constructions right way in particular construction matches it the fact that it matches does in fact specify focus
you it's at the very least not about that or it may live it's certainly constraints the possibilities for because i think that's
i for yes they're working justify the focus right
that's kind of the bottom here when we get there two and
and then the status i used was like again in some languages you know like four inches and child language you might distinguish between different it so
i know it's really poor i know it's going to be feminine or something like that
thing there but actually that's a property of the situation and again
it wouldn't what this of the situation and again time you know it's a certain point things are located you know near or far from you and
and it's unclear whether i
so you might imagine that the information you passed to you know in identifying because preference would be so some you know it's a guy and
know it's a guy and it's someone i know from school so
you could imagine that use get about this you know leave off the polarity you're not
good beach which is more relevant to your life is this is also the folks that is used in the semantics sides constructions
so this is and it did anything you have in the party line anything you have a cement excited constructions comes from pieces is ignoring all i mean
to except for i forgot
that's really information structure is we're sort of
you have read it's and just
and just pick any paper on i'll turn it to semantics
it is old thing it could be referring to usually something and situation right or something
and situation right or something and not allergy so
you have somewhat the same things going on of things being acceptable or not and
i didn't i've never seen anybody right that up it maybe they did i don't
like that whereas in english or say i thought you were
it's in i mean i'm i was sort of do we is why it why he even introduces this sort of riyadh it she you know as your basic math space and then
to study how people use that what's whatsoever
think i don't really know we just don't deal with sarcastic people
do which is the holes pencils they thing and then

back and forth but all the churches have name i forgot to include that you
i forgot to include that you could have a tight including this line so something
it could be simple texas ball
the three have various ways of doing certain things all just try to go through them
all just try to go through them so they get all have
i see and they say the key word construction have some name
that is like instructional constituent i think that's actually interesting
i think that's actually interesting be certainly the most common time but
the name change with the contract which each of which has the keyword contract and then some name and then some types of education is that it's
it's often sometimes the case in the first issue that you know what kind of construction so for example
or maybe you'll have the type you say
here i you could have a joke actual type here
i received its type
skipping sponsor whatever the idea that
facts which i thought was a little bit too order by and
so like we're going to like understand
no that was just a mistake of cut and paste from when i was going with it so
so now this is actually this little change actually goes along with the big linguistic change was just that designate
was just that designate and only something for the semantics to worry about now so we want
what ball is going to be the designated elements of that kind of for
semantic you know it's sort of a frame based construction so why not option
right there does it the point there has to be that constraint somewhere right
in was a good example of you walk in
or i mean or construction or not what will again differ
right so focused as along the scope
that was my way of saying as opposed to you know he didn't order was it meeting i
ever true but you could imagine that you need to figure out what if it's a group
mostly the top one is of image dramatic and
feel that a couple things are like not if and i want to have their or
so is this comfortable to you that
the lower level if you stressed you know john went to the you know the bar whatever you're focusing that and
there's all that let's i don't i so and i think someone to raise like sarcasm is a complication at some point and
i mean if you get everything anybody ever thought about moving out so

there were throw we're going to be a form of the word you know happy or something like something
the the ball and
and and there's there's and and you know by the word ball sort of semantic head in some ways of this sort of interesting article
and there's there's case some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head and
if we go back far enough it's their construction meaning so it's not
as long as marcus now these are form constraint so nominal expression
moving the accustomed to constraints right moving into the place right
assuming that at any point in discourse there's a possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios whatever and the speakers supposed to be keeping track of those the construction that you actually get is just going to sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you've already got going you're supposed to add structure too so in
too so in france watergate wouldn't i've heard nixon or something like that
i don't know where that fits then sort of the idea
it's a relatively limited number
don't have an audition for it but we might want
this is my no as a word
kind of thing going on i don't know whether
entities because you can imagine it should be like really a list where
out what the rules for exactly
what it is and for a particular instance which i do you know make an example site is that you might have instance of container and path let's say as part of your you know into you know definition
so you would eventually have instances filled in with various values for all frozen slots
but you don't we ultimately one two hands of that and that i the two the way we have the time and place because here i mean it's not out here
the time and place because you need he they you know
much like the you'll quit so so
go to and i did it would be if came across and there's
so pulling something out of discourse contexts i think similar to other kinds of mentally something i didn't i've never seen
same thing happens with pronouns there's languages where
there's languages where
confidence or something like and the fact that
i you wrote a paper about thirty five years ago and

future you know this event takes place before speech time was what this means it's
but it doesn't tell you like exactly what it what the point of doing so is so for example
did you just hear that's in the cold is something is that when you say watergate you're referring to a watergate like scandal as we might imagine it happening in france but
of sorting out what the person meant seems like the grammatical things such as the artillery that you know introduce these conditional whatever give you so the most basic those we i
at all but we know what it's trying to say what we know what
so i was thinking about how it relates to this temptation for
so how is it so designate
that's fine terms don't you know the lots of different ways of the world that people use it
it is kind of like a profile background thing but i
you it's at the very least i the possibilities for because i think that's the that's certainly
other thing is so i didn't realize force like
surpassed you could just be talking about the path between this and you know
of object and so then we talked about you know whether does that does like topic as maybe there are other thing
so i would prefer not to worry about that for right now and
that comes right now and to think that there are discourse
reference part and under
french speaker is known some situation right you're when you
but at that happens to sound like the word for i but it's actually
i but it's actually semantic leon related to it no
things like for on reference intense work for thinking of is being used discourse scorsese things actually are relative to a base which can change and we need

that has been a little bit of going back and forth but
so there's some element that doesn't it yet construction on this maps one meaning
i see i'm so i don't know what a form is
i so you kind of have to let this phrase idea in there but
the mental i mean i'm not that the formula some sort of the grammatical side of things is going to have that much going on in terms of the mental space
can not a. k. speaking you can if you don't get a curve over sentence you can find out where is the stresses and say
i mean it is i how old would you
i mean it is the speaker made an english is about to say i and here
and this is we're bland unalterably so some things which
you know sort of the past tense being copied onto the lower for doesn't happen there so you have to say something
shaft and then you sign i this that the other you know
which can change and we need all i'm she
good actually because it's accepted it works it type of all
i'm ties together several of things and
right so is this is the first question what our current purposes
shoot here it is three fifteen or any do you have any
don't know the answer but it's does seem that
out so we had started with the idea that the e. actual constraint was you related to disperse to me

so for example whatever i had here to be a former there were throw we're
or you could just say in case you only know the meaning type
are like run down the street and i
its type i meaning
none of these examples have anything different for formal constraints but
you actual you know sort of like on if can straining purpose
you definitely want it to be couple formal isn't from the parking strategy so straining purpose
now so we want designate actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects
so you have like the big red ball no one else object for now what ball is going
object and we think that it'll be the same one right football
so that all this to me referral thing
but the point of i mentioned in the last
real one and that would sort of it's sort of different dimension of type of that medic allocate right we're not saying what's right
what they mean in how is it so designate
what they mean how is it so designate
and we had a team or in semantic it could be in
so it a table
right so want certain situation and that situation itself is save affairs

like something to be specific words or maybe you'll have
not it's used for matching are only for verification if you shouldn't matter right
want to i there was one time when hans explain why constraints was a misleading work for him and i think
so that's a useful things
so that all this to me a useful things internal referral thing
in fact these are
you may be you me i'll be like everyone else in berkeley but that's
but if we don't know and silly want to you know i'm little limitation every time you see that it's past tense to
no instead of just time
instead of just time same
right so a lot of this isn't happening at the grammatical level
right level and so
especially i probably is an obvious question so i
other frames that could come in i mean i'm course you could bring in say for instance desire or something like that like once
and actually there is right now under discourse segments attitude volition
it sort of depends on if it is a referring or if it's identifiable already or if it's a new thing is
i there used to be a spot for speaker

the type you say i need a spatial relations right here
you want to do something space
open an individual in this could mean a hundred different things depending on quote what the space configuration is at the time of utter this and
to the second one so i'd don't get no i've no commitment as to whether we need it might be
i did and then there are different kinds of focus you can bring to it so
at the very least i for because i think that's the that's certainly true
the middle thing used to be entities because you can imagine
a list where here was varies information and it doesn't tend to be
not this is partly came from told me scheme and
of referring to and you might that might be sort of general i don't know database of all the things in this discourse you could for too and i
too and i a reference because they would
a reference because they would say forty particular utter is you have particular referring expressions in it and those
and have it part of the speech act in some way to some vacation
this and therefore you're supposed to say boy like for you know in france
you know in france kids are allowed to drink at age three
so some things which really are meant to be identified and some things which aren't in again all we

but bottom line i agree with you that we that setting up that's all
stupid early fourties linguistic use right
to use that kind of line immediately
i was asking talk about this they use it really
so they have to be there or expressed in some way
check may maybe he's anyway
one so for example we've talked about if you're talking about the electrical item walk you know it's an action
right and i think that's closer to the second one so i'd
point of robert whenever
this of robert whenever i'm confuses of him you don't
information you know fight you know i walked into the room you tend to think that whatever into the room is sort of like the more focus kind of thing and when you
order was it meeting i think that was a couple of caught him by the link was immediately and so
television but it's most i think it's this is you know the current form other things
i just haven't i just and an idea it would be very if it works it can point at one
@reject@ and i don't know what know this was my for what it works
and then same thing for e. s. l. or you know you're signing and

and in some ways it's very similar to there are very
similar to there are very few changes in some ways from before i don't
did we want it to worry about anything more than the fact that it's you have semantic you know it's
just at some when you're going away for
i think that the other times i related are like focus and stress
polarity is using for like action did not take place for instance a by default
for instance a by default it'll be like true i
you know if you're satisfying events it did happen
blah and it's like i feel like if i wanted to have an extra meaning i don't know
so that's this that's the best way of talking about oprah's is i think it's great
he's sort of sweet
know this is assuming you probably salt that so it's
that some of the and then you just be able to refer to hairy you know and wherever that person whatever role that was plane events
you'll quit so so i would say rest under reference to be something that corresponds i maybe
so here we were gets really tricky is there's some things and this is we're

and or just some complicated expression
and so in terms of the relations you know and usually
be the same one right football the ball the head of the phrase the
blah and you have to build a you got you would imagine that would require you to be very specific of machinery rest passes
rest passes very conventional when we sort of know what it means
in the u. s. and in france it in a for him at all now worst
is just to mark which thing is the topic it doesn't
do you have to say about the binding and bound up in it their findings and values
then right you know like the only once such a certain situation and that
simon up they whoever they are you right so
into because you know fred said that mary said and whatever and so we're
again all we need for the moment is some way who say that
so i thought having like for each reference having a list of other things with which is identified
could do that you know you for instance

we recording
it hello which i
i'm thinking possibly the more familiar to people
so just to show doesn't have to be beautiful attack it could be simple
but it sort of really important for say competition later the presence
later the presence of some other construction says you know are you what type is it part of type whatever doesn't tell you what part
aside from construed and all that sort of that the differences are mainly that we've gone to the possibility of having four meaning errors for a tight
just refer to them i don't think that
i think that's right this and so somebody's going to have to be doing a whole lot of work but not me i think
as opposed to other one so
than causal we have to look we need a mental space we need the context
so we would it be in english and it's sort of an extended function but
which means i'll number it refers back to the person who's speaking or that sort of thing right right so

not that number two actually on the notation because that's
so the person tax is if there's a type it's before construct right
and i think to eat you know you compare like the top block and that actual block we dropped like the little s. script that at
i've had that often enough he was he went to college point is many years and
often enough he was he went to college here forgot
you know but the whole point of the whole
which nothing one two me too exclusive but they're
and all i mean i'm sort of inclined to say let's worry about specify in the information structure focus of the sentence and then i believe ways
phrase signed that but i still live limited possiblity so that
i was listed discourse as a fought where you could say it's active you know there's
dependence like in this particular set else instance it has been referred to recently or haven't been
that so i'm still just really not clear on what i'm looking at the scenario right
i mean it gets a little tiny these are all so far

have and certain things i have changed have changed that has been a little
so the closest thing so i was thinking about how
so that's like the new the sort of like import or whatever of this thing it's so i
thing is the topic it doesn't always have to be the subject right so again information
that worth watching based on a very punk so
but this might so i uncommitted to a couple of these things
intending feel out it just that's the i misunderstood corked so
he's not there anymore but
know this is assuming you probably salt that so it's
and so we're going to have to chain those as
every time into giggles it means it's your job that's what i said pointing robert usually it
i mean those tend to be hockey anyways because
hockey anyways because it or so we don't have that in here are doing

mean which is really what we want most of the time i think
like the question is for example what is watergate refer to their
and then how they interact with some extra thing like in france or if such and such that's like there are certain ways that they can you know one is
they can you know one is a more specific version of the general pattern that from at grammar if you think
you have a set of entities that you sort of referring to and you might
nothing because doesn't have a gender so it
it's going to be great that it has nothing to do with that is semantic as opposed to
form
then medications makes sense to private open for something like accessible that you know not so again open to various things
box like what does that look like for an example like not all of
here this is just says it's
and under and the speaker here apart

the fun knowledge e. component can handle that you can get it come from right
the fun knowledge e. component can handle actually assigning an intonation contour of that you can get it come from right
but parts that the scope of any anything so
i would assume that it's easy problem an absence of all that you need all the other
john is on the bus and not on the train on this on
folk focus constituents i would say that argument structure in terms of like the main like so i don't know
and these could actually just pointed to you know the id in my older list of active entities right so
this is there's a there's all this about discourse as we've talked about
no i said let's see i think we were not but are done
than that because the reference for example
if it's a new thing is new thing you have to like korea structure whatever
every time into giggles it means it's that's what i said pointing robert usually it

understand it but
i mentioned in the last meaning of having something called nominal expression is
you know that has become right after the verb because
right after the verb because we know for me it's just objects and have
it's completely right i mean in fact offends examples you gave int did constrain demeaning about the form
about the form did constrain demeaning
there's definitely that kind of thing going on i don't
effect it's a little bit it's a little different right so or
these are all so far these structures especially from happen on down these are sort of relatives familiar image medic kind of slots
except it's it's trickier than that because
you know this is coming along i think it's

and so one thing that we had talked about is this examples like if you have a passive construction then one thing it does is she you know definitely it is one way to for you to you know specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object and
but you people i that's not very clear from here i mean it's not out
that so it's afraid and merry so the speaker the
right so the constructions my of course will for using pronouns or whatever
in which case they have to check to see who the speaker here where a result of
and ramona twenty five percent most use words
doesn't start with some because it's so i'll be it should be is it just me that whenever i see something i could preface that but i think
so there should be no category called difference between your base and the other and so but there's a
that's it's been evidentially for some my grammatical
and the kind of interactions that might occur in the papers i mean assuming
assuming that people were being healthy one weren't trained to do you know there's

and i think that in general being time it like
being time it like if you were getting a phone strengthen your friend whole of that so buy thing
right around here so there's the issue of sometimes they're really exotic explicit space builders a say in france blah and you
so that should you know track with should overlap with whatever other construction there
i changed the name of i used to be entities so you
but maybe i'm mixing you know this is kind of like the final results after person sentence so you might
it's someone i know from school so maybe that would you know the some intermediate structure that you would pass in to the to a whatever religion or whatever discourse context to find you know either create this reference in which case should be created
is ignoring all i mean in general you ignore losses it but
losses it but it's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them
but pretty much this is d. full range of semantic structures available to except

of that and donna and i mean i can like fight about that you like
i've had that holiday point is many years and
thing so they're very conventional i'd like they kick months right and
with you that we not expecting much out of the purely linguistic use
linguist but it seems to me that the these we you know we've talked about maybe half a dozen linguistics feces in the last two minutes or something i mean
bring to it so like stress that this is kind of a pun on you might have like whatever like accent kind of stress and
i and we what wanting to stress as a form device you know like
versus plus and he is you say right all son is on the bus and
different ex chemist use them in a way that either static or dynamic
and you know container and you go in and out all these things and so

so i think the middle lots this really give you any more information except on the top block and the bottom
and john is on the bus versus plus and he our son is on the bus
that was one comments and
then this says that when and analysis is finished the whole analysis is finished you'll have as a result of sums resulting set some spec for that veterans in context
which he is made up entirely of these things and findings among them
so that's why these are all implicitly one within in within one world
it i think we did right we might be able to get at least a lot of the same structure
so this person thought it's like what's happening offices
this person thought it's like what's happening there what was happening there is that you're moving the base space or something like that right so that's how

which is an argument for construction
the time frame i forgot again when you're
were great examples but i think that something like that's probably going to be more we have to do
and just to note which
note which is that
so that the you know goal love the sort of goal has to be the landmark of the content you know the injured this container or whatever
i don't know those are radically march in the first place so they're
thing so if i say you know in france it's like this you know great we've learned
but the fact is that hundreds of that sort are generally used to help you draw a conclusion also about some implicit contrast like in france it's like

it hello
there's a sort of there's a slot for setting time setting place and
that you know because i referred to did you just hear
so we need to have a notation for that which
you know it'll be another persecution or it'll be i don't know some value from some something some variable in scope or something like that worth watching
that's too will go to the other side officially keep keeping like
go to the other side officially keep keeping like
have recover you know other pointed this going to be lost

and that would be a little bit cleaner in some way but
it just moving the accustomed to constraints right it you know moving into the place right
right and then i think for others spaces that you introduce you could just attach or whatever
right so one other thing i just want to point out is a lot of confusion about the terms like profile designate focus that are
of you walk in like in what you know like is it that it
if you if i said time is you know past that was a set this world you know somewhere before the world of course undercurrents each time so
so if i wanted to i would stick in an extra frame in my meeting saying
and then you know so he say and then you sort of do a role shaft and then you sign

basic those we i think we can figure out what the possibilities are right there it's a relatively
that i didn't know that freenet
know like is it that it was only semantic lee is it is
that you need to take into account in order to decide which what is being focused
and this again may get our every and of course worlds and be into and
then just the same way just like actually the same way as the lower level if you stressed
just talking about this sort of everything she evidentiary lenny and something like we were talking about sarcasm teen
for is sort of telling you in reality you should give this or you know

structure but right
i think that's exactly right tense to you know we can think of art it just like x. tina walk refers to this complicate structure past refers to you know certain configuration of the things that are just so
and then there many in more interesting lee linguistically anyway their relative things that you know you relate the event in time and space to where you are now if there's
and that's also mostly true for red speech and real
and real speech people make put stress and so did
some of them seem more inherently static like
what was the name

or he did watch it the meaning of the pows he didn't walk you know so
i think that still in progress of this sort of them's still
of this sort of them's still working it out
but it did one implication tougher for have for the other side forget in a minute is that i couldn't think of a good way to say cure are the possible things that you could focus on because it seems like
on because it seems like any entity in any sentence you or any meaning component of anything you know all the puzzle means you could have any of them could be the subject of focus
and like that you isn't probably as much use in dealing with the first guy
right mockery

one thing i'm uncertain about is how polarity interactive polarity is
no i think at this live which is it should be where you have it you know whatever hold it doesn't and
it so it's it's fine or is
part of what i'm going to hand you a grab bag of
see i think we were not but it was quite great yet so
yet so what this is like supposed to moments
like supposed to moments complete

so they get all have a taken the beginning
but because of the nature this particular construction you know not just that it's phenomenal sometimes but
makes sense there are certain times when we'll have an exception to that you just in
you just in case you're i mean meaningful for some reason right we're
and now that it's subject it's more like a topic and now that you
and got this sort of bound the complexity i mean if you get everything

sometimes but you could some kind of animate nominal
which will apply just as as like simple proper now and or just some complicated
like a container or sort of support dish
and others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic like
there's things like there's you who by default
you know you see something like or if they can you can say something like i thought you are republican or something like that whereas in english or say

top block and the bottom block similarly only just a list is all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscription and that you can drop the that you can give dual type the one thing i
dual type the one thing i should mention about designate think
they do i just know that this is like we didn't originally have in mind that that verbs woodson categorized for particular sort of form
light up with so but i can't think of like a limited set of possible meanings that you would focus light
so the everything you know about this could be time but the important
if you have a fervent saying

there is a slight complication here which is that we talk about form useful sometimes to talk about talk about are also being a designated object and we think that it'll
meant to texas and normal expression i would say on most people's notion of the higher form types to is this is what right
and furthermore it's worth it in california
so that was the other thing is so i didn't realize
in fact that's kind of can straining how
coming along i think it's pretty it's

so something like past which is you know we think is a very simple as we've often just i can as the future you know
span yet
to decide like how you want to split up like image medic contributions versus like x. came out of countries and how you make them
who we definitely need that sort of sexual type give you some of that
that you know is it a state or is it a change of staters it action of some kind
just me you mean in the slot

and then i have a block that is constituents and as usual
for formal constraints but you can refer to any of available elements in scope right which here
and then you're left with a couple three
nothing fancy
i love one comments and another one

but in general it says the word contractor here you might have meaning reform
but it's at least in there's an alternative to this which is
sort of the idea of sorting out what the person meant seems like the
is it all the same constructions
keep the one thing could hear slightly ever true but

about that right now and our weight we can be more specific if we have to on
by and semantic take findings which i thought might
i don't think that it was often used to given extra meaning on i mean which is
and then when we combined constructions semantic lay the goal is going to be just a lot more and more of the binding needed in order to the final one
and that so and i mean that according to party line that's the whole story

are actually going back to
meaning so it's not clear that
right so again this is this tuna
good i love i but it's actually semantic leon related to it no
on this assumption mary dell rumple this book

but the you could take contract of type whatever doesn't something
are just so that were kind of like having are taking you know
about the real one and the real right
like if you're going to focus on this thing and you want to know it sort of evil all the other possibly that it wasn't so
so my classic my now classic example saying he did go to the meeting that was my way

how about topical man that's the
force like disney that it's you know topic and focus our contrast that so
contrast that so topic is
japanese topic seems that you know thing that might be an ongoing kind of thing
i but it's re say it refers to what you if

but make it this as it is in my mind that does that person so things
often involve a discourse but making a few places
so that the whole that this is the token underweight out of which you can make is samantha specification
you're when you hear something you told of the speakers i
have incentives and then he said i would have i was in the current world

so began
so that's why you put semantic concerns about the meaning bending down here
it also has this idea carried along with the idea of an actor somebody
but when you actually say that he walked into whatever the he referred to a particular you always

and after a little bit more discussion especially like you said i have more linguistics to settle in that case publication against war
and have a construction that says you can have proceeding now and so
and so you have this sort of problem at the for has to meet it doesn't not mean you can get you know
him from school and he came over for dinner it's not the same

so very common example this is that you know in direct motion the first person something should be agent sometimes often
right because they're i think we've got some situations where it would be useful to use whatever the lines are for
element for instance you one to other type of threat missions aquarium and so that's
aquarium and so that's probably relevant for the like where is you know the castle kind of thing because

and this you could build up an appropriately you know for structure according to the sentence
i love it what you know what the focus is to everything else is background how about topical another one
so one keep keeping like pointing for it too
so this doesn't include something which make my me have some effect on it which is

if there's something more a lot more complicated like are so hypothetical or whatever then you have to do your job
or somebody's job anyway pointed
i mean i'm job anyway pointed at random
know but maybe all of the literature

know point but the whole point of what folk an intern or have to say about mental spaces and blending and all that is that you don't really get that much out of the sentence you know there's
one thing that i didn't do consistently is when we get there is like indicate what kind of things it's into every real i think i have an idea of what
i think i have an idea of what should be but there
they're so far we've been getting away with like either take constraint or you know whatever will be a frame

right me too exclusive but they're different meanings
useful that we might not needed an occasion for we don't have an audition for
you know it's an action it
question so i just neglect is becoming perspective actor under bigger observer

you know in a nominal expression and
later but i think the note inherently like the general principle still work though that
grammar so that's i think that's the main thing we want to and so
linear time than your space is like you know are they doing

if it's just that thing a little or the constituent
a little bit more or the constituent that falls in
a little bit more or the four phrase or the constituent that falls in
so the question is actually cigarette and it would

bed because as a phone queue and not even trained experts can always hello they can tell you with the focus accident is sometimes
so that's focuses on
so many of the other ones i see so
actually one of the child and researchers worship themselves studied a bunch of these constructions and it was like

part of what i'm going to hand you is a whole bunch of scheme is image and x. chemo is a grab bag of
do you have to say about the binding in your values
what i'm kind of confused about this is what the speaker and the humor is sort of doing there so for a particular
that some of the reference part and under events

no i said let's is there a slot in here for the children of the findings are done
makes sense i mean there's this enough in the scenario which just tells you
misusing and have they're bound together
and i that some of the discourse segment

right so want itself can be as and it can be just another frame that's part of your
be as and it can be just another frame that's part of your
an action and what you want is work
do there are other than causal

people so the top like it's just sort of a of abstract irritate you
i meaning category is there that
there that then you kind of this one is sort of a pair

finding and so it was an issue whether constraints there were some linguist who reacted against i'm trying think it's not used for matching then it should be call a constraint i think we want
i think we want to be uncommitted about whether he's from actually i right because they're
so situation like bob said he was going to the movies where that lower subject is the same as the person who was saying or thinking you're actually required to have a high there

so it should be the again sometimes i'm intentionally
that this that i should be so many constraints on the bottom was just a mistake
nothing with meaning

of the head and it's they push to get that if i understand you right
that if i understand you right
off and the priest increase up to supposed and all that sort of right definitely

but that was mostly for reference purposes just refer to them
and we had a team or in semantic it could be in
semantic medically so semantic lee so

right afterwards and back
construe so
we get that on the other side a little like very mentally there's a sort of

yes that's true i like setting for the drive other countries whenever i can
but by the time you simulating you should know that so places right
here are some examples of the sorts of things you might have in there

him at all now worst and now that watergate we're not talking about the real one and the real right
anyway so that's the only there that there are many more things that are on this is like a little bit on television but it's
pretty it's hard to tell this is one major thing we have to do which is the

but to say what we know what it what medication setting up that's
one is in the traditional like semantic highlight of one element would expect everything else so high pot news
else so high pot news you profiled this guy against the background of their rights rectangle and

kind of thing that parse or you might want to think about whether we require you know these
no it correctly require you know these things are like it's a magically part of it
what you if it were harry refer to like someone always think if

of thing because you might want to say that location or some certain w. h. words bring sort of automatically focus in you know i don't know the identity of this thing kind of way on certain elements so
the thing is that i know said that list was sort of discourse dependence like in this
there's a whole book which operates on this assumption

though that we could have constructions that have sort of constituent structure and that there is like you know for instance one
to but they can also overlap minnesota fighter way so if you have like
we want to and so far it's worked out them

the phone bed because you mean forget about stress the form q.
topic focused it seems to me like background profile or
or landmark projector or some something like that there's definitely

but if you don't know what your focus is then you're hopeless the last anyways and that's fine
and the only way of figuring out what that is man is my sort of generating all the possible alternatives to each focused on them and just decide which one in that context makes sense in which one doesn't
somehow and it could also have friends has a category spot should

so but i think the i'm not i understand is something we want to build a capture
the i'm not i understand but here's what i
different it so the big come and then finally dispersing is about thursday jackie information surgery like utter in specific

on this on the bus versus on this on the train and john right
the fact that you can get it without any stress and you have some whatever's predicated anyway should be the same a stretch that's what i'm talking about overlapping
or something like that but in actual fact i think that they're intended to be sort of neutral respected and different ex chemist

so that's kind of the bottom here and i think that should be a little for two
something like open to various things
that sort of that the within the event is a one world

and actually is just a list of various slots from which she would draw in order to pay your picture bunch of frames my and findings right
and there are other was are not included here general couple friends
it wouldn't what this is free cursive person or far from you and

it's active you know there's is hierarchy there's a scheme innovation of you know things can be active or they can be acceptable inaccessible is the one that you
is the one that you know keep you know those once do some of them files and
there that when you say i think you're actually hedging

no i mean i would say that i try to keep out here that were potentially relevant to most things
no just make that we're everybody it's going to be great that it has nothing to do with form most things that is semantic as opposed to
each time so that sort of that

so those constraints up here and constructions
which just tells you how various whisky misusing and have
no end of things that you know we don't deal with and

like in france it's like this and therefore you're supposed
that comes in and they discourse level constructions in a sense topic because there's that would say when you focus something then just
but about linguistic had just i mean those

and years that's not just the fact about france joseph and do something
joseph and do something about how boring it is here in the u. s. right and so
and then there's some other minor things

there so you have to say something about you know texas determine relative to current blah same thing happens
right so that's how far and they were talking about and it happens different
and it happens different under different circumstances and different languages and so

so the result of what thinking since the last time we met but not as much writing is the shit that i have a lot of like thoughts and just fusion comment on all the time
on all the time how as right now

it's two things it's a one on one side is a sort of the revised and updated semantic specification
i just wish this is just one machine right and this site is certain revised construction just when she

just wish just when she said nothing else
no i think that they taking you know i mean both right into it

and usual disclaimers are the all these things are it's only slightly
are it's only slightly more stable that was before and

this line so something like will there's an example
i think that's just flying just

construct fine right
isn't included but you can ask question that might

and as usual i all the construction site all the examples here have only one type of constituent that is like instructional
i think you if you want us to spend a pleasant six or seven hours get george started and

i that direction all here i
this they use it really mean this in a frame this is the profile dom and these other ones are required so they have

the idea that sometimes there are general construction site you know you're going to need the equivalent
unclear whether i mean you could just have in your scenarios cure some extra few things that are true right and then

it and then you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you're talking about
is just an interesting coincidence but

right which here are the contracts to say something about the relation
really we usually don't of point of at all but we know

so buy thing if i just said name one that means name one formal which
so i so for now i thought maybe i'll just have in this list of things are relevant to this particular utter and try everything else

that order we have a few funny things where something and the meaning like or something but
but we're not going to really worry about that right now and

relation but inform you might also have a value my you know you could
rub point so

like that there are certain things that are actually value similar to the findings below but i
below but i mean they're just usually they're going to be value fillers right

called
the ex you know a fedex came out

be the again sometimes i'm intentionally i think i'm not
so for example depending on the linguistic on the context it could be

or whatever meaning like meaning to man thing right
minor my rub minor point

or to man thing right message is of other people's buys these
think i'm actually gets across these as so

so can ask question that might
so if i understand this bean aside

no i don't think so i think so that's kind of weird
i don't think so i think that you'll do fine in fact that's kind of weird

i think that's just flying just
that's why i'm asking right

but now i'm i mentioned this i don't
i mentioned this i don't know if i ever explain this but the point of

because it seems like having the verbs categorized for you know like i said taking his object just some expression which designate this an object or designate the thing or whatever that leads to some tactic problems so
that wouldn't be i and then set up the this set aside reference

can stroll is it is a big component that so there's probably not
that so there's probably not worth trying to do anything to really gets back but sort

like that you say all right i'm supposed to add some structure to my model of this hypothetical past france universe or something like that
the information in this tells you that much but it doesn't

here at the structure to the space
and right so you'll say even one causes and be into

in the last two minutes or something i mean
but it's what it it's pretty easy to put it in the fall isn't though i mean because information i

i mean it's my feeling that these really hard problems that decide exactly what's going on
an actor somebody can do walking or

for now i am going to say like profiles often music to use that kind
later on like i mean the best thing i call was that information structure have a list of folks element for instance

or i mean or so again differ how they
and we still have emphasis as or stress or whatever we'll get

you know i think he's a only things toward the end of sentence post verbal tend to be the focused book some of the new
book some of the new information you know

kind of thing and when you but you have stress on something that might be you know a cute that the stressed element or friends of the negated element is kind of related information structure so that's like the
you know all these different things that if you put stress on different part of it then you're focusing we're on the right

thing it's so i think that's kind of to keep focused being in information structure term stress
that's it's been evidentially

he walked to the meaning of the poster he ran
what if it's a group whether some event is happening linear

but i think what's the one thing you can't it i just kind of focus for differences you
differences you could say it's the depends on this as opposed to the action or it's but

light up with so focus light up a highlight
up a highlight as opposed to

there's like we a lot of other that keeps and i've been working on terms of like how you deal with like an adjective
maybe you want to forget stress

we could do that later but i think
of that depends on asking my you know and i

stresses and say hey that's my focus expending
it doesn't tell you anything what the focus is if

so but i think exactly so the through effective it is something we want to build a capture
is th

yes they're working yes not every but there are constructions where you could actually take into account those considerations right
or there was a whole list of possible speaker attitudes that like they told me was just like

so again information travel talks topic lot and i stuck it in
and i stuck it in thinking that we might use it

draw a line and like you know you also have some tracking of what was going on
you know specific scheme of things like whatever

entities so you see a scenario reference and of course i can and
and scenarios essentially what kind of what's the basic medication what event

you know the room that but they be represented this was somehow and
even though saying that place takes place whatever if you if i said

should be there category we're in for instance
for instance could be a pointer to want all of g.

in it and those are the ones that you get information about that used to can here friends is
used to can here friends is i know it's really poor i know

purposes so it's a little different from just saying all these things are true for my parents
how you get it made may and often involve a discourse but it making a few places

in which case should be created here and you
that person so hollis is gender neuter

asians i mean the performer they're some of that depends on asking
you can do it just a phrase i think as a parent had a call in the middle of the sons and on actually one of the child and

and you're just talking you know if
no i think at this live which is it you know if you're trying to have enough people to simulation you need to know that you know whatever hold it doesn't and

and binding on toiletry items
the foreman really

is we're sort of the kind of profiling on different parts of this i mean what's interesting
i mean what's interesting is that the information structure

this you know great we've learned something about france but the fact is that hundreds
but there's a great scene thing going on there that when

focusing that and it possible infringes encompassed other things
good i love the foreman to it no really

in a way i said no but
in a way i said no but i semantics is if you're tempted internet browser search engine is acceptance

here is a little bit harder could be like multiple
could be like multiple people i that

some someone you know this before you get to the you feel and all the rest of it
i how old

corresponds i maybe each reference you probably have a list of ways whatever the way it was referred to so that's
rather than not always have incentives you know whoever it is

right the space builder
we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces

that's also been analyze this war before x. and having nothing to do with high in the role shifting
high in the role shifting is completely left out and so on

ask me about it later
man

i just mean there's lots of different part i don't no too much rather like grammatical
there's lots of different attitudes that the speaker could have and that we can clearly identify and so on and so forth but like

things to talk about what

disincentive

i this is just one machine right revised construction

before i don't think everyone is so

irritate you serve like listings of the kinds of things that we can have and certain things

the so somebody and have called construction so

need the equivalent of a noun fraser provisional or something like that and

and usually have formal considerations along with it and then

about what meaning what specifically want so

so i don't know it's actual hold but something that just you both instructional and mean type

script that at some scripts refer to the form of the contract

formal which makes sense there

right we're actually is more often that only had a list one specialties you know george and jerry walk into the room in that order we have

before and i should put an example you of something that isn't intangible relation but inform

my you know you could say that you know name one dot you know number school world or something like that there are certain things

school world or something

my name's there was talk of changing the name of that and

which i thought might be too restrictive in case we don't have only finding and so

so that whether or not it's used for matching are only for verification if you shouldn't matter right

him and i think the reason that he gave was similar to the reason why john i thought it was missing is just an interesting

it but i'm starting to like it again

if you have an if then face know what the done faces called

no but right so the other strategy you guys could consider is when you don't know what word to put you could put into work

so it should i'm i didn't mean that one's an intentional

that this that it here i actually was just a mistake

so strike out the and subscription on the middle block so now

and that you might feel say things like if they had has to go last and i had my own language you can refer to the head as a you know the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that so that's

there's a list of things that isn't included but you

if we go back far enough it's their construction

construction type that's

and a previous you know personal decision certainly allowed you to single out the meaning but the you could take

i don't know if we'll ever have a case we actually have if there

no i don't think so i think actually have if there is a form category constraints you could imagine having a triple there so that's kind of weird

so nominal expression is the fact that animate is meant to texas

so you want to you know you sort of have this problem like what the word of let's say the word dog you know that has become

mean you can get you know the kept a dog or something like that meaning that the dog

i have no problem and i think it's fine but it

i mean we do not reverting to the bars theory of phrase structure but right

so why not option that you know keep mentioned also was like if you have more after construction such as subject press get things like a medical relations

those could intersects of these that

and that aside from some terminology that's it

but javon address question in this definitely would for instance the semantic constraints we talked about here just

here just fine games but

build the mental spacing is you know that all these things that we don't

build the mental spacing is clearly not here you know that all these things that we don't right so it's going

so it the pencils tasting

really gets back but sort of as soon as he gets back i think

so what's what's the time frame i forgot again

just at some sort of a mental bridge i'm not i'm skipping fourth of july

you're missing like the premier you american holiday

so there was one question i can't i hate

right space you know by you know what people around here so

we sort of know what it means but if

i think that's exactly right structure past refers to

no i think that they to see how it works out when we do the details but it

but my intuition would be that's right

and this would've off everything they can't imagine to fit under your seed taught something you the sentence

us know what this past what this in the future

what this in the future versus what if you're

you know you can imagine pro those are absolute things you could say about the time and place and then there many

i mean i'm curious about how much or the mental i mean at random

you know all of these so called space builders that are in the sons are going to sort of i think of it is

i think of it is to give you the coordinates of you know

in a different context you know if nixon had apologize right away it wouldn't near watergate wouldn't have hurt him so badly in the u. s. and

we're not saying what's hypothetical about this world in the first

about this world in the first case hypothetically were imagining the watergate happen in france in the second case

in the second case for imagine hypothetically that nixon had apologize right away or something right

in the short run all we need is enough mechanism on the form side to get things going

you know there's not that much information contained in the sense that just says

and exactly what that means for the overall ongoing interpretation is quite open an

or but like what was the point of saying that since about nixon in france

that is not there's nothing about that in in the sense really that's we usually don't

stupid early linguistic use right

and when you're the linguist but

and the second use is the same as slightly different no

i mean i was a little bit surprise that i knew that

right there's another term that i've heard for that thing but they i mean

right i've heard for that thing but they i mean i at least i'm

but they i mean i at least i'm so they use it that way and

right i think the designate that we have in terms of meaning is really the highlight this thing with respect everything else so this is what

i mean but the second one seems to be useful that we might

it but we might want one so for example

can do walking or if you talk about the magic of red carries on the idea of the thing that has a property of having color red so we

right so we used to use an efficient with for this and i think that's closer

no it correctly they're not required sin practically part of it

right lee is it is still required to say bye simulation time though to have some

right though to have some toast that i'd meant

toast that i'd meant the idea of like that this many values filled in by symptom is i don't

by symptom is i don't know that something we need to state it's like say ever as part of the requirement for the

can through that it point

but this is going to be a you're right that's a bit of a mess

right that's a bit of a mess and we still have emphasis

know by i'm going to say this and how we use these terms don't you know the lots

suits i think that the way i we would like to think back i think is focus is something that comes up in i mean lots of bases

of bases information structure

it's like it's not it might be that there's a some tactic device that used to indicate focus towards that

focus towards that there are things like you know i think

you know like high volume or whatever

and to see was that from it's a fact which is

which is that kind of focus we have is were emphasizing the value often as opposed to other values right so focused as

and so the like if you said he you know all these different

or it's but it's identity thing or contrast with other things or

things or stresses value as opposed to other things so

other one so it has some certain complications for the later on like

current form other things we didn't deal with

we should put example in this we could do that

you know they have constituents right that you can like

right that you can like messed things when you need to but they can

so if you have like a lot of grammar trees and like this might you know be a little so opaque but you know

but you know we have the properties of the pentagon verse and some properties of constituents constituent base grammar so that's

and so did contact depending on what once every four phrase pay breaks restart it's just

or map from the country of that you know i mean later on we'll worry about exactly how

or map from the country to what the force accident is on we'll worry about exactly how exactly to figure out

is to figure out how that

i would assume that it's

but it's what it of all that you need all the other information i

can just say whatever it's the container be focused or the entire whatever bulletins on

whatever bulletins on

i for yes they're working and depending on the construction may or may not justify the focus right

so we talked about that delivered this morning

john is on the bus

just a little different folk focus constituents i would say that argument structure

that's what i'm talking about overlapping section so

so the question is actually section so then you have a separate thing that sticks out you know stress on something relative to everything else and it

and it when that would have to it might be ambiguous as it would be that element or the phrase signed that but i still

so the question is do we have a way on the other page on what we get this semantics side of saying what the stressed woman was score stressed raise or something there was so that's why i was

right saying how because i couldn't think of it's easy like limited way of doing it all i can say the information structure has a focus lot and i think that should

when we get there i'll white and for and i don't have a i have a great way were great examples but

man that's the other side of information topic comments how about what

topic comments what

i know i don't have as many good examples of like topic indicating constructions

on like focus right topic

japanese has this so you know kind of thing topic marker

it which is the discourse situation context record right so

record right so i did i meant just like draw a line and like you

and there was a big sell comics for it you know looking at the details of this but

for instance you can imagine instead of having

basic medication what event happened

general couple friends in general like direction you know specific scheme

and it doesn't tend to be grammatical a specify able information about reference tell you about some entity that you're going to talk about so harry walked

so harry walked into the room harry

and room you know the room that but

be time but the important thing for grammatical purposes are for things like number gender keep

scheme and not will need all these actually but

like utter in specific kinds of things so

so the coming i was going to make about changing and to t. entities blocked a reference is that you can imagine your discourse like situation

you know where or this is something that's like in my world knowledge but not active

you know where there seems to be context properties not active

properties they're kind of infringes i used have a location thing there but actually

is free cursive person too we do the mental space start we're not quite that wichita

we just don't know yet are not right

utter and try everything else there is there is specific

and i left the slot medications open

because you can have things like the guy i know from school or you know it's like

or you know it's like europe or preferring expression might be constrained by certain i'm down to not amounts of prep you know pretty predicates that you might make

are your but if you strike education purposes so

right this guy i know from school came for dinner does not mean there's a guy i know him from school and

it's not the same effect it's a little bit it's a little different right

maybe that's like they're sick not restricted you know it's like it gets

you know it's like it gets into that kind of thing for

it so you can imagine that this might so

let's see so maybe having made that big skits of like large scale comment teachers go through each of these lot each of these blocks a little bit

so when we actually have the differences

have the differences

dynamic like source at school is often thought that way

or force or something like that but

i think this came of them but ben and i were working with the spaniards them the other day span yet

up and i think again its going to be something any thing that tells you is a static or who we definitely

is there any many too when you have sort of or measures spend it and when you don't

no it's like x. it's it's like i was thinking of taking that the ex you know

so the difference my you know and i in general probably be you

so the difference is whether you thought it was obvious what possible fillers for be you especially

it was obvious what possible fillers for especially

that's that one right i think we've often used agent patient of exactly

so far i got to go off and i'm like is not that

and i'm like is not that important right now

we just need the ability to who write it down if somebody figured out what the rules for you know how exactly

but the reason why i left in because he might have changes state let's say where some state hold some something doesn't hold and you're just talking

at the scenario box like what does

good let's mark that i forgot anyway is a some kind of causal structure for composite events

now what caused the stiller's will actually be themselves frames right so you'll say

like i don't you know it was like hope wish desire

the first place so they're more likely march right at least in english

it so that would be a higher frame then right you know like

and it it's an action in that's part of your

in our in our for in situation but right

for in our arts situation but right

for in our arts terminal she want to be an action and what you want situation but right

a mental space we need the context

that once we have this line if he is your tool kit for doing the semantic part of the instructions and then

you right that makes sense i mean

there's almost i

there's almost i mean we keep coming back to how focuses like this projector landmark thing so if i say

suddenly for a whole sentence you know in france such and such happened so the whole thing

but just so the whole thing is sort of like again implicitly as opposed to other things that are possible and

but just to look read it seems the medicine my formal mutts ruth and it

i never know austin is his name because

is his name because he's sort of

and but very confused pecan that's

intending

there so for a particular segment it's really just a reference to some other entity again in the situation right so for to

right so for to go segment the speaker might be you are might be me

all these ex russians art in much the same recruit actually dependent as here and now and they're know this is

so the speaker would be fred and they

particular you always figure out who you are you all right maybe is that better example who i refers to

of the speakers i mean you know the speakers in fact that's kind

that happens to be the speaker this simon up right

to be the speaker this simon up right

like someone always think if there were if it's i you've heard of the current speaker

rather than not always which is given to be like you know whoever it is

i would have i was in the current world

right so again this is this tuna goes into the mental space into because

so this and tired thing is inside the world not

the world not just like the top part

i just haven't i just and an idea it you know whatever it can point at one

there billy medals biscuit

there's things like there's you know there's all kinds of like i think i mentioned last time in check if you have verbal saying that who by default

so we would it be in english and it's sort of an extended function but

but it's not perceived as a court of construction i mean it's been analyzed

i mean it's been analyzed by the formal as being awol before fork pronouns

this book ninety three book on pronouns and no was horrible

ninety three book on no was horrible

or you know you're signing and

or you know you're signing and someone says something and then you

i mean the point is that pronouns reference is you know sort of ties in with all this mental space and so on and so forth so

so that does sound like a consistent with what we're saying i mean that right like

so it's kind of like the on like mental space our current context and then

context and then when you in bed them sometimes you have to pop up to the hot you know depending on the construction or the whatever you your scope it might break send out to the base one

it would be to actually use the same nexus since there are so many

since there are so many cases where you actually need it'll be one

so this or the other it's like actually the same offices

i'm for going to read the transcript of this month things

but the but it's too bad that we don't have recover you know

for some my grammatical eyes people talk

eyes people talk about it this way

about it this way and you know you can do sort of special things

and it was like not using any kind of interesting embedded bad ways just

interesting embedded bad ways just to mark you know uncertainty or something like that

like activities i could remember what it

i could remember what it meant allergic

we're just talking about this sort of everything she evidentiary lenny and something like that right i mean but it's something we were talking about sarcasm teen

like and the fact that i'm you know fact maybe if i think it versus anything that might you know depending on how much you trust the two of us or whatever you

great in english thing which distinguished abolished to study know

i read that favor the edges and

paper i read some of the paper actually

would you believe that paper like directly to the development of that i like

that let's i don't i think at some point and we just

we don't have to care too much about the speaker attitude right like there's

attitude right like there's not so many different

i as some there international markers i think for the most part i don't

right so is this but like water the distinctions among those that we actually care about for our current purposes

shoot here it is three fifteen or any do you have any

i don't know the answer but

to do you know there's all sorts of god the irony and like that you

is that but he's either because in term so then
