i just sort of keep really one second sir
can see that you know we have so created these tasks before we came up with our discussion notes so there's a lot of
this in front of people they give us some information on themselves
of you that's insane but she does know everything yes i understand everything yes i do
that's the day that connection
variation by what other people think about this in terms of
like i we're trying to women detail of our on college is types of places that someone could go right but who
right but who is it that has to care about this or what components
lots of pronunciations of the same thing are going to give you better data you know a few pronunciations of lots more things
and assume that will that the construction to use their will give us everything we need to know about the sort of sue castle whatever type things these bigger places that was
dropping that can be done sort of to say now we've picked these six tasks
off the top of my head it kind of seems like you're probably just want to you know richard it are more complex
because i don't fully understand like what our choices are ways to do this year i mean we have tested this
ways to do this year i mean we have tested this and you have you heard
i that it was very style eyes and quite a lot of people said more or less the same thing
and with this we're getting more no
and say how long it's going to be
i need those back by the way
that's that maybe one thing we should do is go to this listen sort of select like things that are categories and then offer only one member of that category
than having doing they could but it did maybe but and then i mean they could be alternate versions of the same thing you want to date on different construction
they could but it did maybe but same thing you want to date on different construction
the movie theaters probably also and it's they're
you can sort of tagged onto that tour or you can
i mean this in all those to john know thing he
bicyclist
actually maybe assess for
i'll take information about that i want to
gays in there so i want to know a lot about the history just a bit

and i'd be half to be implemented it's our data connection
but she does know everything i understand everything yes i do
and she has a way off making this machine talk so she can
forth i can outside of prostate science from these two here meaning it golf course goes we had these stop ass everything that comes from situation
so they make these decisions i think
or your influences i think
i think it's easy enough to set that up if that's your expectations so
i started two or the as a matter of fact the second person is is we're faced with expecting this kind of set up
of course no i don't have a transcriptionist but
a transcriptionist but what we should be able to do and
i don't favor don't have time to do this but
week get i mean you
get i mean you can buy another disc for twenty dollars right i mean
common like it you know i tend to theater symphony or operates as a group and tore
a group and tore the university counselors zoo all
the function especially a different than the getting information or
so since people going to still take something we're not going to get any significant amount of redundancy
what's this idea of now they're on the same tour sometimes the next door
dying out
let somewhere but
three drives their walk there or be driven which means bus taxi arts
this going in there t. would suffice i think we if we said the person

technical will do another day probably
bought we are going to worry about all the decisions and the things that the that contribute to them and
he has a handout
maybe it was too fast punching and every react to updates and you can
so i it seems to me is that we ought to decide you know what things are actually going to matter to us and
and so the zoo when the university in the castle it's cetera are all big issue things that you know have different parts to them and one of them might be fun
the this was sort if they sell out different vet tech t. v. t.'s
are more complex going on people trying
i did sort of scan it at first and noticed that and then looked in detail and one of them but
but we want to get going beyond more which is a so let's
that but then it turns out to be three minutes and forty five seconds
i would think people would you know hesitate whatever it is
organize them and tell him which things are
but we can in fact if
and then what expect is that be sentence types would the responses would tend to be grouped according to the kind of activity you would expect
i mean it seems that the difference between going to see something and exact exchange mine you know i know it
you just went to approach it
i think there are different things where you have much choice for example more that's it
i mean it's so there's a couple of different ways you can interpret these things right you know
to see the true or false

and these data tasks where we can assume the person would like to enter you or just approach the thing the
have to decide fables carry out whatever we decide
i started to listen to one it was just like sort of depressing a sort
a sort of listen to the beginning part of the person is just sort of reading off a script or something
detail and one of them but i noticed that too so
exactly this is limiting the trusses but at right to catholic
very but the person was able to look at it and say this is what i would they should do
you know they will go back to hotel and then will go off and so
and yes so all the tools it to happen so when he was a monday
right by a visit to proctor whereas some that's where i had never went back to their work you know so whether that
so whether that causes that we do tour are not that
hell freezes over so maybe that should be another probably season there after
and the reason why do we go there in the first place i eat
there who is the torah is the prisses it might be a person
i wouldn't i would love it with walk because hills and
the best seats or the peanut gallery or you know whatever the best pizza
i mean from my point of view i'm and so

then they would read task where there's a german words sort of thrown in between
here it's goat or favorite and find one
it is it's all solving our problems or it was wonderful
i i'm not how long
the reading nobody's interested in that except for the speech people right we don't care about that at all
all i my is going to be ten
timing wise i have these three do we need to find
the sort of court or something or both
i mean like for example my father is like a couple of prague they'll
it just meeting people with activities
taxes are very different than buses
once drive their walk there or you with some other form of transportation
and then said the middle part of is always sort of the golden way right

this very sketchy simplified map and they can take
and then just sort of has to watch which find finding deficient no it's so it doesn't make sense to figure out whether he wants to interview are approaching uptake if you never wants to go there in the first place
this makes the design thing fairly simple
up one is in the these people are going to take this and introduce speech with it
and that way you get the speech that was the question first
but i think i got the point and i think i like it we tend
i think your station is good which is will do a batch
all of these do have this kind of who were
three do we need to find a differentiate in there
did you spend the whole time it looks like we're i not
i would have got the weather been hell freezes over so maybe
i eat it's either for sightseeing for meeting people for running errands or doing business

one of which is figure out what all's the choices are what we've done a fair amount
whether the users fifty or not and what his budget is could be like it's going to result in some financial state of the user
how much wedding she willing to spend
so we would rather just yes you have a bunch of people talk about the zoo
so the story sort of or you can say this is something i would do is i want to do sometimes and in my life
driving and we actually biking's should be there should be a separate print because we have a very strong bicycle planning components
we think that's it interesting enough that you know it or

run force coming out but
that i think are two places where it comes up one is
so goto taste name given a choice to
so i go to a movie with now entertainment dying out
and that's different that's
i mean they're hikes that you can't get too but
but i think other things you can't remember right

and no all that's left to do then is the c. p. t. stick on the show of a tease for the likelihood of a person having enough money actually wanting to go sit across
preferences i i usually visits too was i usually visit castle so i usually and
thing to build a system that had the most data on a relatively confined set of things you do something else and
so all things that there's a kind of question of what we're trying to accomplish
although the so that's not it does suggest that
now i have looked at all the data and it's actually at least two an amateur quite redundant that it was
except for the speech people right we don't care about that at all

now of course if everybody says exactly same thing it's not interesting
i like it we tend to put them into more high rock co session so goto
you know the first thing about all the things you might like to do
so keith what do you think
know it feels like a long time but
but so i think it's a good idea to start with these sort of relatively straightforward reese just response system
but this is my first guest in

but it's more the whole do people phrase these pending requests
you i mean i we don't have any huge temperature is
and then if we want to get them to start doing multiple step planning with a whole bunch of things and then organize them and
day's so you doing something now in europe time to do this three four things
put exchange money is inherent right but what about
would say that if dine out it's a special if you're
so you can see you can be really make it asked cheapest possible or you can say i wonder is i don't care

you have to long will it be i would say maybe two weeks
bit different and these it just places where you ensure much like here
needs food and find
probably be based on the entrance or even the situation we can conclude
or this efficient or the appropriate amount
but then again this may turn out to be insufficient for purposes but
i will start you was it

reading is out of these tasks more or less imply that the user wants to go there sometime or the other
we were going to put this in front of people they
through all them are going to start tomorrow at three four
that you give me those dozens of files and i looked at one of them which is
tell him which things are near each other and you
all of these do have this kind of who were aspect about the way you would go to them

not that much statistical with it we don't
entertainment is a good one and their think
you what but my some sentiment is there
money is no object money
no research behind that
constructions are primarily semantic right

three times right into
problem we could change the tasks like see if we feel that we should have stayed at fort sort of for every decision no it's trenton
and decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices four calls on other modules
so if the natural language understanding thing is we think the only have to choose parameters but you know fairly large set of parameters
is a fictional system to come the computer systems it's right in front of you that's insane yes i

is again more or less we have than the
and that way you get the speech of people saying zoo over and over again or whatever too the question first so
this is a question for you and
you and you know if we do we probably will actually try to build a prototype
that goes with the energy that's sort of part of that's not the destination reason that's sort of on personal right

know you can call the system and have two days
that we have to decide you know what is the appropriate scenario
so i haven't really gone into the you know look at all of the that's going on so i don't really
that it seems pretty straightforward
guest in much the same way is how out you know should throughout be should be the easiest

and we would be ultimately more interested in getting all the possible ways of people asking for different things with the computer and
john know thing he sort of had it in there who is the
might be a businessman using the system what's the sort of court or something
also education's further along will get into business about you're you know this is going over mealtime do want
mealtime do want to stop for a meal or pick up food or something and

let me some rice and two sentences may need
may need for you best benefit too but we have not heard about the data collection at all or have you heard
i mean you're talking about rather than having the user decided this they're supposed to we're supposed to that they use you can always
the money some money that's money

so and this actually turned out to be pretty key because having specified sort of these this intermediate level and sort of noticing that everything that happens here it's
bored soap if it's one service one luxury item you know one biggest place and so forth and so on my is that the data is going to be easier they had on my
you know if we feel that they want to do nothing about that thing then you know we should put out that to the i know that they probably went to use all the time to have so
it seems so that's out that visit

the reason why we did it that way as a reminder is no person is going to do all of them they just going to
a breather and see whether we want to make it more complex or not depending on what sort of results forgetting
so but on the other hand the system doesn't have any public transport this the plane or system doesn't have any public transport in it yet
transport i mean in terms of interesting bits there's lots of that's where

can i go there tomorrow or your
that was the first subject that person wasn't very good
and i looked at one of them which is about ten sentences found fifteen twenty different construction types that we would have to look for in time all right
want you was some part of what of the time you half

and these change no this is not i don't see a release
no this is not the release from this the but
the release from this the speaker information form the release but fine

they pick a couple say
is a fictional system to come
and and then after three test the system breaks down

end up doing you get involved in that process through
so my question is
i it to some extent we should you we just have to try it out and see if it works it

so the system could say would like to set up your program for two days and i don't berg you know
i don't feel for i can i mean it's good probably schedule ten people
or towards really do have different styles eating another one you know

we have to help we have to decide fables
it's not and i wrote in now people that have to be there and
there and it was hot they debated that but given with me that everybody probably has a good speeding weather it was a farce the joke or whether there were enough people and if you go to turkey

say how long it's going to be so you have ten subjects
couple days or the week i don't feel
for the person don't get it i mean

this means audio
no transcription of course no i don't have
and they said i enough and that

time to do this but it would be great is you who would not transcribe it all but pick out some
i mean we could listen to just sit here and listen to it all
are you going to have the only along knees website

so that'll be on the web page
that's what i was suggesting for the first round of that category
so rather than having doing and then i mean they could be alternate

that for the person don't get in the short run
it i mean this is what we did it because when we gave them just three tasks full part paying three test a puppy and no they can still choose they just wouldn't be able to choose both
part paying three test a puppy no they can still choose they

look in terms of decision notes
i've only there ten years ago for
do you mean you listening particular constructions or do to listen

i was interested in this proper t. nine here so if
here so if you look at look at that
it sort of next day's so

hopefully nancy come not she won't
so i don't exactly understand like i

seems to have about a two minute
a two minute i it's not that i didn't try

commented and what they're about and sort of the proper keys we may give them
not all people can do that

so like pop up a level
don't know what is the the english caught cognate if you want for it the sentiment in stock

record dialogues more less
this or what components

want these are what our subjects going to have to physiology any
you know which things would you like to do tuesday morning

any comments i can still be made in the changes would be put in correspondent let me
not that much and is a fictional system comments i can still be made in the changes would be put in correspondent let me some rice and two sentences may need for you best benefit too but we have not heard about the data collection at all or have you heard about it we were going to put this in front of people they give us some information on themselves then they would read task where there's a german words sort of thrown in between and and they have three isolated proper names and these change no this is not the release from this the speaker information form the release form is over there in the box and then they going to have to she was from one of these tasks which are listed here they pick a couple say three a sixty an effect six different things they sort of think they would do if they were in heidelberg or driving someplace and and they have a map like this very sketchy simplified map and they can take notes on that map and then they called this computer system works perfectly in a sense everything and to come the computer systems it's right in front of you that's insane i don't see a release but fine are trying to yes i

and and they have three isolated proper names
and these change i don't see a release

form the release form is over there in the box are trying to
and then they going to have to she was from one of these tasks which are listed here

and so this is broke down but let's continue
yes it looks a bit pays for me i mean

and once for has finished his class work that's what we're going to end up doing you
into the state i look at one of the files you know one of these

and for no the question is how much of these decisions do we went to bed in explicitly into all or data collection
you know we could call is c. e. o. of you people visit the zoo we could choose cosby's

so let's see i think that from one point of view all these places are the same so that
but we should just make a decision whether we feel that they want to use some substantial or some fraction of their time

i think my temptation for that they together thing would be to you know he's persons
you know he's persons only go do it once you have to worry about them being

then we have these six thing and then maybe do something the other day saying
be the easiest route even if it's a little bit longer no

you know they should get the c. d. that there'd be six things they have to do and they
and they can be done maybe in two days i

so they make these decisions can i go there tomorrow think
in time all right let's start here

so there i mean it i'm that if that's what you did then they would start telling you about that and then you could get in too various things about ordering if you wanted
or should we allow for it or something that's enough complexity and that

so i we going to mass great the system just as you said simple response system i have
i have one question i got one response

going on people trying to do more complex it's things i mean
things i mean you know if our goal is to really sort of be able to handle a whole bunch of different than throwing harder situations that people will get them to do more linguistic more interesting linguistics but i mean i'm

i'll take care of the
bit you can't get to the philosophers way very but

you know maybe a bit different and
right we if we write

in fact if you use the right verb for each common like it you know
they turn out to be not so many different kinds of things and then

so we and we don't know how many we can get next door it thee shelter for example
for ten bucks probably quite a few

i said let's go back then it's hard with all the decisions and and see how we're doing to do people think
to do people think that you know this is going to cover what we need or should we be thinking about more

he's there to teach a course at the business school but he also is store
would have in mind was a fun socializing with activities

that they use you can always say it but it's just so if we had over these parameters if we make if we have a feeding that they are important and
go the normal weight whatever

you know so and i like the idea that you know sort of jerry push
sort of jerry push the study from the very beginning that part of the understanding business to sort of make a good question of what's the sort of important in this general picture what you need to if

organization and they had wanted me to define what the quorum is going to be
and i look at the other ones so they waste ten percent of the student body has to be present at the general meeting otherwise it's not and

way right you know so i assume we're back to the first interpretation right something
i don't know it's different from today i he was going for the second one i actually it

the object becomes entity right
so for company

you know it or something very close to what is going to be going to be enough
right so so i think the order of things is that robert mclean is a little bit although looks pretty good

no can you give me the remote

going so even could you read your numbers you know

about to have any way to turn off your screensaver on there so it's not going off every seems to have about

i told it to stay on for ever and ever but if it's not like and it just doesn't open like man has a

i just sort one second sir

but we just be working on it that intensity so it doesn't happen let's see

so what i've tried to do here is this all the decision knows that we have identified on this site

so these tasks

and that i be for example here we have eve intention and

the same on the object information we

so there's a lot of things we have no in that i asks and that may or may not be a problem we could change

it's trenton and the intentional score scoring to place now going to place later on this intro trying to

trying to and attention of going sometime on the next four or the next day or whenever i think

and it's just make that we're all oriented the same so

the same so what we're doing do today is two related things one

one of them is too who work on the semantics of the bullies nets which is going to be the main inference engine for the system making decisions and decisions

so to do that we need to think one of which is

then we need to figure out what influences choices and finally

choices and finally get to do some technical work on the actual belief relations and presumably estimate the probability and we are can

and we are can do be probabilities today technical

them and we're also sort of it in the same process going to work with say on what there should be in the dialogue so

the dialogue so one of the steps coming up real soon used to actually get subjects in here and have them i actually record like this

and depending on what phase sort of provokes them to say we'll get information on different sects

how people phrase different attention smarter so for get people with

smarter get people with the phrase them and so

the phrase them and so for you know keith and people worrying about what constructions people use we have so many we have some ways to affect that mall i need the way the dialogues go

so what robert kindly did is to lay out a table of the colleen means of things that might come up

the kinds of decisions so the

so the on the last our decision nodes discrete values so if

so if we're right you can get by with just this middle column worth of decisions and it's not all

decisions and it's not all that many and it's perfectly feasible technically to build believe that's that will do that and he has a handout

and you can look at this if you want these are

not at all or have you heard about it

a couple say three a sixty an effect

six different things they sort of think they would do if they were in heidelberg or driving someplace

and and they have a map

and they can take notes on that map and

and then they called this computer system works perfectly in a sense everything

of you that's insane but she does know yes i understand everything

so she can copy sentences into a window or type pretty fast and

pretty fast and the fishing boat use speech synthesis to produce that so if

produce that so if you ask older i get to the castle then i'm several seconds later become harder you're in art that they've got to that castle is a

in fate comes on the phone as a human operator

and recent of get the idea what people do when they think they speak to a machine and what people say when they think they speak to you or know or assume speak to him

and and they have some thirtysomething signed up something

run because i don't know whether that person is coming out but

we're still looking for room and the sixth or because they still the way that conference room behind our backs but

i it yesterday what let's offline

i it is happening dividends let's offline

and jane and not working on that as we speak

that was the the data collection in a nut shell

and i can report to so i did this but i also tried to do this so a

so a gun here it's

gun here it's wonderful

we get to the even at just focusing on the go there no

and then to go see this would be so the reason know and timing no and so forth and

and what happened is that design wise eyed citizen noticed that we can we still got a lot of iris from a lot of points to one of these supper go there you was there goes or a situation no it's so

i came up with a couple of additional notes here where

being the same at this just the money available which may influences whether he wants to go there if it's

there if it's your charging tons of daughter for admission or it's going to cost a lot of staff

twenty two million to fight too international space station

than the situation no it's contributing to the end points education goat which contributes to the end point and so forth

everything that comes from situation everything that comes from user goes we had they sent you and

and whatever we specify for these so called keith note or the discourse it comes from the author construction pus or what contribute to the d. n. d. a tendency to be sub no it

we could choose cosby's at the zoo tomorrow so

tomorrow so we have no intention of seeing something but not now but later

so that did that in terms of the linguistics and there maybe a few different kinds of places so

to them and one of them might be fun

they just going to select according to their preferences i

then like that and right now but sit the point is to get too build a system it's got everything in it that might happen you do one thing to so redundant

and the speech people for example are going to do better if the if things come up repeatedly now of

you have to worry about them being bored soap

they had on my porch if it's possible danger that somehow there are certain constructions that people use when talking about a museum that they wouldn't talk about with the university and

but i i my temptation is to go for simpler

know less variation by what

so i don't exactly understand

probably we could get by with the prototype only handling a few of them anyway so

given a choice to either the symphony taebo opera type or the tourists i'd got type weather night except the school type person and they said this is and that's go too big a space this is what i would do

it works it would be chatting in a innocence and tried to make it so complex that they even really should schedule on the planet more complex thing in terms of

no but i think this is part of the instructors dropping that can be done

we have to help we

that's what we're going to talk about that

@reject@

but the i don't i'm not really interested in sort of face planning capability but

and that i think the data would be nicer if we get temper references so

and you have you heard listen to the first two or the

and it is already with this it got pretty with this setup and that particular subject it got pretty complex maybe

maybe i suggest we make some fine tuning of these get sort of run through ten or so subjects and then take

and then take a breather and see

in fact i and just you know today next couple days going to start really diving into the state i

right i mean once i start doing that i'll have more to say about this

and you can always did you did say something important which is sad you can probably keep yourself fairly occupied with this simple cases for quite a while

i noticed that too so we want to do more than that

more which is a so let's take i think your station is

i don't feel for i can

huge temperature is just when you have to how long will it be

let's plan next monday to have a review of what we have so far

until we reach the gigabytes thing and david johnson care because me i'm going to put it on the website

dollars right i mean i'm like

it is it's all solving

but anyway so if you can think of a way two point is just too interesting things are you're doing this or something

make it make notes or something that this is you know something worth looking at

other than that i we'll just have to listen i called like

listen i called like it's only ten minutes each right roughly

the reading test for look for i'm not how long is actually going to take

the reading test for look for their fourth cup by is actually going to take

their fourth cup by fifty percent in

it's actually like five minutes about all i my

that people know it feels like a long time but

it seems like forever when you're doing that but then it turns

but but construction

you could but i think like one person gets the person with the zoo as a choice and the other person get to

that you could but i think in the short run a choice and the other person get to

a puppy and exactly this is they can still choose they just wouldn't be able to choose both do and say trying to catholic

but then i think this approach for very but the person

we get it disallow it traveling to jews and castles at the same time so

time so

but know that i mean that just sort of this weird or becomes you know maybe a

kinds of things and then

this is where the function for the function

and for reasons we don't want it's ready in that sense

so if you can think of any other a of high level tasks trust me do just always just me made into awesome though sneaking into collection

but it seems like since we're getting towards the subject is fifty subjects and if we can keep

and if we can keep it up to surf five forage per week rate so we may even reached the one hundred people say takes off for chicago

one hundred people have to be interested

israel's people off campus up from campus so far right

what's this idea of next door i mean

you can do something immediately

so the story sort of just like the idea current round of tourists yes or right probably between

probably between back at the hotel

i mean if you if want to be precise about it you know and i

and i which words do organize their lives

you know they will go back to hotel

like we're i not ask you more right

we do it's when you say on that they admit it never happened

business is supposed to you sort of like professional type right

it might be a person might be a businessman

like a couple of prague they'll be there for two weeks he's going to

it just meeting people

i went to meet someone somewhere which that puts a very heavy constraint on the eve

you know because then if you're meeting somebody at the and all you're not entering a usually you just went to approach

so i mean this is capture like where do you put exchange

if you're doing it for that purpose and it's entertainment

that goes with the energy depletion function right

needs food badly find

and find is pretty year

mode

mode i have fallen three drives their walk

how much of fighting back and you get around by public transport i mean

there's lots of that's where

i mean like the sort of the touristy bit you can't get

i mean like the sort of the touristy bit you can't get

who's like biking they're part of like driving and

bicyclist trippy in that but

movie half by i mean it's just unrealistic i mean

length is do you want to get this over this past as possible

they want to do it so badly that they are willing to spend you know the necessary and last time

it seems like it would be really hard

on another part of the system it seems like it

and that we can x. t. unfair them to a significant decree all we ask and put and

and put and part of the system design is this it looks to be important and you can't figure it out then you ask

but please don't ask you know all these things all the time or

right and the time or it so but there's that definitely a back off position to ask

and there's no part of this system ever comes up with the idea that this could be important no planners ever going to ask for it ask

you need to if you want a simulated for except for what parameters would you need for this relation

i think that would definitely be part of it

for me i mean it's inappropriate does los vegas

but i just i kind of how much money i'm going to lose but

i think there are different things but it really understand what's more that's it

for example just interacts with do might you willing to take a taxi

or you know if you're going too be up or are you going to look for the best seats or the peanut gallery or the best pizza

if you're an extreme sport person you know i want to go there and i and

i want to go there and i and on it being the hard way right you know so

about that i want to know anything about the topic to see the true or

if i care about it being open accessible or not i don't think there's any middle ground there

robert and even buster going to actually build a belief that has sleepy teas and you know tries to in for this from various kinds of information

say is going to start collecting data

and we're going to start thinking of about what constructions we want to elicit

do you mean and they're going to make it a raid on for the data collection to listen
