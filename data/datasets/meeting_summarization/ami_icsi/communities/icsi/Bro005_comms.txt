so you've got some direct things that's out
so you get older you have these different perspectives i mean
so yes it's so performance but with a male cat stir system going straight interstate u. k. see
out and so the mismatched condition
so we just you know for kind of systems the first one
the first one you've combining the future screens using and each feature
no print but if just a trend that
a trend that there's some dish upset and they tell you know what something simple
know what something simple like that
but that's need to so called if we want to get improvement by combining get c. n. and she goes
she goes energy you doesn't bring much information and
on what that was italian mismatched it digits is the testing and the training
so the number is sixty two nothing too
of eighteen they do eighty two
aerate are eight her era tracer so that's the this accuracy
tracer so so we have nine let's this accuracy
so even just p l. p. it is not in the match condition
he had b. n. it gets struck i wonder if it's it just to he in all caps true or whether it's that than that for some reason it's not you know
i mean just it be i think with a case you a different
be i think with a case you a different
iffy it is like six
so adding m. s. g.
gee i use and if you see the debate thing that you was on i know my eyes it should be i'm i keep getting confused because this
on i know my eyes it should be i keep getting confused because this
be certain getting confused because this is accuracy
and the m. s. g. doesn't however particularly affect things
but italian
we said these
so then you're assuming multi english is closer to the kind of thing that you could use since you're not going to have
since you're not going to have matching data for the new for the other languages and so forth
just before but i want to double check when you say
stefan was saying that they weren't can label
no we day spending type don't pay
pay fresh eyed giant to combine some such a phone day and be on other fish and
we've gone
fires that if it too i we'd i would've done study studies done
on the going to see a doctor and d. she doing shown road and it's you see the same credit nothing
eight point six notch no not trained with all english
not trained with all english
but he's the second configuration so not my day that's exactly though
key in but in stable the first call it's full and then the and this it comes from the future i see the same way so asking
i i'm say that gives more experiments if one wants to look at that but
i you have to each t. k. training also do you
i you have to each t. k. training also do you
the training is just coming up with the too so i
down on ten friends they divisions
we suspected it in new york size into the targets
but of course we don't have all the combination of these from
much as i said with terrorists that know and i really
your isn't necessarily the bad me no we did that
training set some kind of found so we can
and some question we the answers
look at these different ways of combining it and
or the distant
so did this would be more working on that be is and addition of bass instead of an insert into their bags
train you can just take through their training calls also but
purpose replacing overdoses for

then they should take let's see anyway or it to be
and underneath the basement at the baseline
you should take the second him sets of experiment freaked out and so the mismatched
much english we have ninety one number
we see that for k. digits image you perform as as the get the
eighteen sixteen percent or something of here if we use don't english instead of matching condition
that i mean it's good to take the difficult case but let's
that know and i really like to rest and i really
like to rest and i really like in the street
they have means and variance is and so forth so
so that the southern
as an additional path right

and and here they got this in the more important but in using that and the choosing that she
on that and that's the reason that was i has also we then makes she see with online on my addition but she
yes worse so this is all better because
i'm all better now
so what that's what happens is that when we to i and i know my station we jump to almost ninety percent
when we italian you run it's work is the same we jock jumped in ninety
whatever the my addition to check
it's to double check when you say e. in these other tests that's a multi english
and it might be if someone's interested in it certainly encourage anybody to look into it longer term
to get out of this particular russia for results but
english and effective training and something that there be aligned instead of pounds

for attack this
but don't you to look at that
and the multi english does
so if we think this an error rates we start off with eighteen percent error rate roughly
percent error rate roughly
the same but we do of they've got b. n. p. did studied down
chamber yes i mean i can't compare the other because this is
so but if you can do good normalization it's
i think pinch meet which using more than fifty just run noisiest train network
so it's just one approach
best pump the best to you or something once

you know you can come and details yes i
this is italian mismatched
thing but you're saying a little bit general things observer bowl so far there's something you're not completely convinced about and is
you have to sweat fix it fix its teaching english and effective
i mean have you looked at the alignments at all with the turbulence
at all with the turbulence
that might be arrows and of string of forums
get the work has what i miss you see i mean
there's a regression

i'm for the favor of it
testing and the training is italian digits
she had to compare it with the wand over that you've got in a box which is that
it just on say digits
but this has been updated because
so you're saying that although when we see yes
but just regression so
if we have some drastically different conditions and we just ran a different o.

the same because we thought that was your seventeen frames
and the interesting kid digits
now that we have a number i suppose for the match that i
and he was like two or these by the network
bets or even you could train nothing the target beaches
but the third issues annoyed dependency perhaps
results are
it just don't just need more results

configuration so we use feature about that and i thought put together with teachers though
right so you know without changing the scripts for h. d. k. which is the
and so if you do that for instance it may be the case that you should not be considered a strong
so before following fish that this seems to be the training said that gets the best of the best network so let
that works pretty for the train
that's the inserts idea is kind of strange because
in when i was four work for these other ones that
overdoses for reverberations

which is the rule here you can still change the variance is which would effectively
at all with the turbulence
with respect to the network size that's
that's when one experiment that's didn't running and
running and we that the receptive they comparing
and once or search
and that think that thing seems important
maybe not just the best pump the best to

so it's aerate are eight
oldest is eighty two if you do this eighty two
like a crap educate keep the good cops
kind of struck system
where and and you're on the tour carry paid by and you
actually i where i do prefer to do exactly what they did when i was in belgium
so perhaps think something like melted down train them about this he's which future space targets could have if you it's interesting

eighteen nine
the number of frames just but so
the future of workers try to connect to be prig in the system to o. j.
vested open christian there were to put them in
and for the couple different ways that you have of combine
and and because also perhaps we know that when they're very good features that and be doesn't have
searching it and talking about combine mobile features

just two week the numbers here are recognition i could see so it's not this again it's just a when yes ye systematically should
mean match but use of italian training italian timed it just for guilty only
so the she's busy education she seen that they yes
on they open but they'll put those that payment be you eat we don't just done studies done on me craft
on me craft i did you a business they saw it done date day by saying b. n. p. we've been stunned study of
eight once it gets that gets eight seven

yes i'm device nine minutes nine cockpit he's eighty two
she's almost all these two thirds of it
it's all but perhaps and the feeling that it's something that's quite seem
effect it's they build
when you say not clear yet but
i mean did that the fact that weather fourth flows digits the gimmies and it is the best

it's there is and just kind of say juicy
to say is a good line too is good
as an additional
wanted to go because they're doing l. the
they would send this is what provided sweep the future science and
without putting in a second

buses but let's not get silly
on such days they meant one i need to i e. i. e. you wish to you fight and i'm pete
we jock jumped in ninety percent
this is the threats of key in but in
the future before as as a beginner as and then the another past

because the economist not compete each
the mismatch just refers to the noise and microphone so forthright
posting for date did u. b. p. a. p. did that is that craft eighty five going see i went on
and of course everything and trials

when we use the training and timmy so it's
so i don't think she's the bug but this is
it's not even h. decay
and i you know the real open question

they tried to combine different they've affected they're
they're just saw it you died that m. a. c. fitch it doesn't work for they dug and at the base
kitty food we look at the table these
the bug but this is just something in probably and s. g. process that

but that's that's without thee during that right
look at that but you know on the other hand it's just experiments at the level of the age to get recognition it's not even h.
what the knicks pots of the duck just sweat busy kia kind of summary of fourth everything that has been down so
were to put them in p. timothy

that's it doesn't you're on that and that's the reason that right
perhaps i don't know but maybe we craft they not and that's what's it'd be they've done this other maybe that's one thing but see
and the other smoking down it's i think it's more robust stupidly changes
one of the cork aggressions for that is if we take the best ones here maybe not just the

you know and i know that friends nine and then adding m. s. g. does nothing
it's it's or english but it just not all of the multi english right it is something to be said part of it
it's but it just not all of the multi english right it is something
it's it's or right it is something to be said part of it

so i could eat it decrease the accuracy to improve form or the
and i get a. t. three point six
so we have a two point six and eight once it gets that
i start to admit to ban may maybe training

you know dude was that things aren't done
i a. and starting to train also that works with larger context so
but it seems to people important teachers that
we know that there's a miss there's loss lost performance women are on a strain done conditions that are different than we're going to test on but

i the other thing is to take and if one were to take a couple of the most successful these
so i think exactly the same i figure ration seven downs
seven downs with nine france of context
and we just train them to meet

so we were upstart something next week
they take you to make a decision on which an peace can be the best of the different languages for the
and perhaps doing this phone jen changing the variance of the streams so that's another possibility
but if you had say heavily reverberations cake heavy curb ration case and i know reverberations k. something that was modest on of reverberations and you get some result in between the two so

languages for the moment it's that they make network and perhaps the that were print and everything so
so no we that he's doing its work some with that gosh it works
but so we if one million enough for some premiums
in fact the online normalization never using came from the honesty this and so

this demo song finish and see
summary of the first forty five minutes is that some work in sports and some doesn't
i we can do a little better now
assume that's the feature

i think that in the in the short time solution
that is trying to figure out what we can perceive forwarded it to make the greatest progress
so i agree it's probably something
just make that we get the same results we can duplicate it before

i said so that the last column we use our imagination
treating nick would like to see
could be just a truck system

and underneath the basement and again all of these numbers are with you a hundred percent being at the baseline performance but with
so with that ten correspond to the first line here of where the training is thee italian digits
so all right so this is i was thinking on this was worse so this is

so it's much english we have
and stretch features we did that gets you what on the food she nazi
she eight point nazi notch no

how many experiment using futures and net of puts together
and to cease the results are on the other
so we can discuss censor after francois

information and that's carmen said if we combine the two we have to reserve did you it
the baseline system
and said the baseline system was eighty two percent that was trained on what tested on what that

tracer so this accuracy
so we have nine let's say ninety percent ninety
which is what we have also we free you was get the intimate g. together

percent and we didn't really
if we use in you around at work even the future i'm not cracking on my diet we jumped in ninety percent
so we go west ninety so we go from eighty six eighty eight point six two ninety or something

and straight teachers we did that in fact and stretch
so but spying and everything
could have if you it's interesting thought maybe if you just

no you can just do it and as once you've done the training
and then we again that in the and that there's just coming up in that this committee it's a little strange but
that this committee it's a little strange but

courses potentially open can't worms because you
and it's because of the context of so
we still have to work and finish

for all the around six million for the last one
except in the future so not bad
a kitty except if the future on up to you know nine

we only have two hundred week to get trent this and
trent this and then the two thousand i
i think this movie that think i think that was the right on this island right

it depends i've got the rick majerus it's
but perhaps it's not really deep nine month that's bad but that
that's bad but that just the funniest spring that he was you know nine

getting shit
not noisy but continuous teacher not
thought maybe if you just trained up

mike one
mean we're testing always buses but let's not get

one's though this has big five
perspectives i mean lowering the word or is find but having big fine

then they should take
experiment it's either this information from doing and you're the work if we use only decide and so it's

the next the seconds a box of the table
yes it's so system going straight interstate u. k. see

no we see that the gap between the different training set it's much much more it
but actually foreign geisha training on timmy just but there than the other languages

i'm training with other languages it's a bit worse
so she's training and that's infringe on any

and one hundred and four when we do that
i'd be interesting to look at it because i

are on english on me and the thing
better now like if you start off with the other one sort of hesitant words and that has

except for them and english which is always
that your problem

exactly perhaps the fact that the there's no real bessie's for what
not care yet because on that soft raymond same nonexistent

@reject@ of fifty two percent of eighty two
too so i you could it just killed them

he had b. n. it gets struck give the same results what industry for some reason it's not you know same result much
what industry so

same results what industry same result much
so you had this results if so it's

so you had this results if get be alone just feed feeding h. t. kids so it's
eighty nine is bigger than eighty two i'm

addition but she had said eighty two
because of what but they should we online on my oldest this

and we cut off i about twenty five percent of the air
two point six eighteen

we said these that because
we have a potential they have

or one medium frame
how do they do over range of these different test not just

from the future so it's just so i could eat it decrease i see the same way so asking the question what's what his adding the m. o. p. done to improve form or the
but that's just not care yet because

and it's what is the range over these different kinds of a tax so
i cost found mart it's the same as sucked

season nine and they've got plenty
and they've got plenty like if

on distant uncle difficulty would easily class babysitting points one
what but my son for the reverberations case at least in when i was

which which made by hurry
you think the alignments are bad i mean

fantasies but you concerns is there
that you know it's back into the diagonal means that it then you're going to it's kind of internally multiply it get in implicitly exponentially aided to get probabilities so it's it's going to affect the range of things if you change the parents some of the teachers

so it's precisely given that model you can very simply fact the is the strength that you it teachers that was
that was a very suggestion

context so this would be something between traps and that's it down because
so it sounds like isn't that correct some of the problems with some poor normalization but if

and other gruesome ice fishing
d. and combine them with their future stream i see

there's but i they're supposed to m. s. g. supposed to have an online normalization
i mean i don't know that we need to

but also there's an online normal besides did you see this online normalization that's supposed to be
so we was so the first thing of course you're going to do there is to make that one can get those labels find features that we get the same results

i mean we single pronunciation house and so
we single pronunciation

french phoning strings were corrected manually so
that might be arrows

training targets i like it
the training said is both questions with answers ever that interested

i mean it when fantasy would be if something our particular toward targets
and you have some reasonable database

on but if you look over range of these different tests how to these different ways combining the street features with you know features stand up
it's that seems like the real question

so i we want to get their path running here right you
considered and we d. v. d. and combine

and we been d. binary adults
so that treat can't get or and then the teachers

you know the other thing is twenty and i'm i'm
i'm i'm searching it

that you did have interpret interpretive effects that is
that is that yes if you knew what the reverberations condition is going to be and you train for that then you got the best results but if you had

between the two so sort of behaved recently that affair
so you think it's reps but they're too at seven i mean these

see i book you were doing
you were doing something that was maybe analogy

of it's gross

it's i really put calls has this

it so there is kind of summary of what has been there

summer it's experiment since since last three can also

since last three can also see respected throwing work and this

so since last week we've talked to defeat the call on with so if you chose with nets train them get the we saw nine of my addition but

addition but sweets that's also because the economist

one standup completely saying but we have

but we have more of yourself to compare with it's work using wind up yet tea and

tea and find any that seems very important

when we lose the docks training set using french spanish and english you have one hundred and six we thought that in eighteen

thought that in eighteen nine with the that and

and so far for italian that

i see down near the bottom

see down near the bottom of this shit

she use i think the training that i set it we have one is in seventy two

even the context you would was quite the same because we thought

yes so the second flying is that too yes no single across language experiment that we didn't have last week

and training than that on french onion spanish

what's receive that the nets are not that good except for them and

then we start to work a lot that they today's something sent that just from the french from the spanish from the me from spine engaged digits and from ten digits

so it's just another line another set of signs and the table

and this person that's what that spine and yes

and actually we did this before knowing the results about that

so we have to redo the experiment training and that's with get beat but good that

it's bets are down and the that using french spanish and english and

we have also started teacher combination experiments

and each feature stream has it's own and then peace

own and then peace it's to kind of see we have to depend them was proposed

we're just pretending

secondly using futures and get to transform and it few books

and the third one issue to use this thing and get seats some from features as as and they beat up books

yes i hate guns i

hate guns i mean i just say that for something if we dusting use they did that would cough i mean pool when we use some combination

just two back when

just two week the numbers here are recognition i could see so it's back when yes ye systematically

see so it's not this again it's just a ye systematically should yes

baseline is eighty two

so it's experiments on the italian mismatched for them

this is italian

albeit see that didn't even the english and beast dependent

if i didn't it that's office payment i use machetes argument

beep goes no credit to increase the ugly

but this is not the case free time what where the or right just it's almost to twice you're right this get be

dish right did training off they h. sticky yes

so so what that says is that in a match condition we end up with a fair amount of worse printing and the guilty

that i mean match but

face so @reject@ of now fifty two percent of eighty two

eighty two if you do is that it's the or a business and so and it's you see two

yes all better because eighty nine is bigger than eighty two

west ninety two ninety or something

no i mean i seats on

i seats on eighteen nine ninety eighty

you know and i know that friends and then adding m. s. g. does nothing

so so actually speak answer for experiments with one instead that adding m. s. g. if you does not help in that case

and we almost cut that in half by putting in the online normalization another on that

not imagine condition but

that because they're more difficult

and the multi english is how much

it's one medium and that's good information

it's one medium and information

so it's still a turret choosing her virtue a fair amount to add and it's french and spanish

maybe if we craft day and you then you know right had to work china and we've been speed is done instead of done maybe

done instead of done maybe the find out they saw it must be that it i don't know

security is just to be simone

did these numbered these a. t. seven point one number has to become composite

chamber yes i mean i can't compare the other because this is

the other because this is a result english training

which is that to eighty four point six

but i mean he's case forty seven point one that we use immature puts for the get the net and straight teachers

eight point six notch no

but he's the second configuration so not my day that's exactly though

the first call it's full and then the and this it comes i see

so it's just the question what's what his adding

because we s. a. t. eight point six

and even the and it be alone

eighty three point six and eighty eight point six

eighty three point six and eighty eight point

park i don't know but maybe

case but let's consider what that means

things that i mean my interpretation if you're near secretive suggestions something like that's it's motivation when

when we trained on data that is in one sense or another similar to the testing data then we get a win by having just discernment training

when we train on something that's quite different we have a potential they have some problems

and if we get something that helps us when it's somewhat similar and doesn't hurt us too much when it's quite different that's maybe not so bad

it just so the question is if you took the same combination and you tried it out on on say digits

then does that you may be seminars conditions and so forth does it then look much better

with teased that both go to a nation which i do i'm spending man you seem de niro no none that we've name brought got it and

so he i even it'd be but

i but it is better

maybe and you know again maybe if you use of delta there you would bring it up to where it was you know at least about the same for difficult case

maybe there you would bring it up to where it was you know

that's so perhaps it is it jumped as the last experiment it's so

that's so perhaps it is it jumped as the last so

it's again but this season nine

cindy situation lacrosse one hundred and six

then we did say talk to a nation i if i don't follow that it doesn't what

what work about said

about said that distant uncles who would issue

but way there's a another suggestion that would apply to the second configuration

and that was that if you have a feed two streams into h. t. k. and you change the variance he scaled variance

he scaled variance is associated with these strange you can effectively scale the strange

is which would effectively change the scale of these two streams that come in

and so this is just setting them to be

you have equal weight

decay i you have to

you have to change the

i mean did you came on those that on coverage

coverage that's

that's exactly the point i think that if you

i think that if you change what they are

several variants fantasies but you

so could just be that beating them equally teaching too strange equally as just not the right thing

because you maybe it should be a different number for free

trials tests

tests

so the next bunch

we've had some discussion it's even shown

about to country

discussion with you nixon even preppie about four or trying to prig indoor and that's works with their within their there something like that background

i to in the torque after the future before

discussion about misty bending traps

perhaps if you remember the book bag rounders to pry ideas for about they expect randy for each could take it down

make the system looks like a crap

and on the a large database so but spying and

because see have quite large bounds

so seventy nine and they'd be trained is

with the trees

for some premiums for all the around six

as you mentioned to me because he only that's and labeled

and perhaps that's just what makes the difference

the other artistic be being

so the seventy nine and that be differ for the front things first

first with respect to the on line on my addition

there are pitchers bat online on my vacation

with respect to the futures but respected

but respected use of the top on though

i think this movie that right on this island right

did you up starvation ration swiss we discussed already that

the fact that be turn on target task decrease their rates

and then and it beeps trained and it's up to another target asked you can preview or rate compared to using straight futures except

and just depends depend damaged bets or even you could

the best network so let me be before you go into what pushy so

what pushy so on the m. s. g. problems

i think it's kind of in the category that it's it may be complicated

for results but in the short term unless you have some strong idea of what's wrong

but also there's an online normal besides did you see this online normalization that's supposed to be

this was the bad online on my mission

your isn't necessarily the bad movie me no

@reject@ to use quickly with each we do

it's probably something simple

if someone you know play with it for a little bit i mean

do but my would be it's something that is a simple thing that could take a lot of fun

and the other the results observations two and three is

that's pretty much what we saying that what

that what we were concerned about is that if it's not on the target ask if

it's on the target task then it helps to have the l. p. transforming and if

it if it's not on the target task then depending on how different it is you can get a reduction in performance

and the question is now how to one out the other how

out the other how to they merely rate the problems

so just that the reason the reason is that perhaps the targets that dependency language dependency and the night dependency so that's what you're say there actually

so just that the reason the so that's what you're say there actually

i don't think if you know freeze up too talk about the language dependency but

but that they make the torch get the best but

get the best but there's so and the other day friends effect it's

just you just sit here

i don't think we want to mess with the microphone

when we see yes there's but you would expect in terms of a language dependency in a dependency that is when they're on that is trained on one of those untested on something different you don't do as as in target thing but you're saying

which is english to it

the other i say worse

did you look at the spanish lying in common

because i mean is just looking but

but it's no currently necessarily with you so badly from of it behind it depends i've got

i mean we single pronunciation the pronunciation house and so

manually so we ask people to listen to them dissent dance

and we give the same string and kind of corrects them

yes and she's not treated if you

i thought some of that's for trained with a spine and so forth so that the southern

so from these results we have some questions with answers what

what should be done this for conflicts

they comparing that works with five hundred went doesn't and it's

the training set

of found so we can't does which can set gives the best result

right i mean the multi so far is the best multi english

best multi english just means right

so and when you add other things in to broaden it gets worse

ever that interested sort of the smoke this multi purpose could

it so the training targets i can eat

that two of the main issues props pasta in the language of dependency and night dependency and

and perhaps tight rangers the language dependency we should focus some other kind of training targets

because of teammate three

for a moment you use we use funny kicked targets but

targets but because of so year's such a country targets soft targets perhaps

targets perhaps even usenet towards that doesn't do education but just regression

so trying to us you running towards that

there's a regression

but you could compute futures and not features we talk not i mean comes from the few noisy chose in other features that are not noisy but

not our targets

not again of short term sort of thing

i a major risk have their thing is being

so did you so what this one thing did this could be that could that perhaps to reducing rigid tendency unfold

tendency unfold for the spots we could combine the sweets other approach like but potentially to approach so the idea

so the idea of put things all the noise that the can find inside the database i think

but then which is copied over many times with a range of different noises

because what you're trying to do is come up with a core reasonable feature set which thing going to be used system so

i mean there's lots of questions one of the cork

you or something once most promising group from these other experiments

real question

so if you just take guilty with the double deltas

it and take but they just take multi english because that works pretty

and just look take that case and then look over all the different things how does that

all different assets

how do they stand up

that's another possibility

committee a little strange but on the other hand they just before

there's the way we wanted to go path right because they're doing l. the
