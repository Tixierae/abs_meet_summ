my feeling what do you think
but it allowed for them an extra dimension might be an interesting break for them and also it is
because we can incorporate december strictly and it'll be a more complete transcript so
complete transcript so i'm i think it's fine so there's
i'm i don't know what they're doing or a digit at a time or because
i think a lot of systems sort of get half percent of course percent we're right
forth and you do this gross things saying i if this phone starting there so
so the fact that they're reading first of all whether they're reading and i'm a room of people or read you know just the fact that they're reading will make a difference
and it depends what you're interested in
know so they maybe the single beach do take some very small subset and i have a big program or take a small set subset of the conversation speech in a small subset of the digits
if you're going to add the features it's also
to add the features it's also useful to have some level of representation which is the reduced it's of pronunciation variant that currently the pictures don't give you because if
everywhere so there are some things that you don't have access to either from your or the specter gram but
right that if we can't we should put in another level of description there for going to get into some of this low level you know i'm
and i tested on three or four meetings and it seems to work i mean sally i would say out
say out some problems with up i'm like of course
i know if we were to start with this and then tweak it had manually with that would be good right they might be
it you know it really depends on a lot of things but i would have
and so i was in the process of like anything this wonderful news
be funded experiment with also
so that's what we were discussing sportsperson among it right

my digits
those yours is pretty so
that as you can see from the numbers on the digits were almost on the digits
so that the reason it's not just a transcript is that they're false starts and miss reads in this keys and things like that so i this
is something it's all compromise right so the
it seems to me that would be good so have a few minutes from different meetings so
both now you're saying different meanings because the different speakers of because the different audio quality or both or
both different if a number of speakers different conditions we don't have that much variety
the word strings and if it's good then that that may give you a good boundary of course if it's good we
of course if it's good we don't then we're fine but i
i was glad fine but i don't know yet whether these segments that contain a lot of pauses around the words work or not
good and then i run it the channel ice program to get into the multi channel format and

p. they'd be able to do phonetic level coding or are they busy for the next couple of
it so i mean i and this would be up there alley so we could one that when you me with john and fine what just on anyone applied and they'd be good to train to
i think so too just came up could be very interesting that have that day i wonder how would you first my
interesting thing to think about it might be
and then that means that if a person contribute more than once in a given overlap during that time been that two parts of the others end up together is the same channel and
channel and then i took his tool in last night for the first thirty minutes of one of these transcripts i tightened up see boundaries on individual speakers channels because his
so that's great but being to have some more meetings not trust one meetings too to be that there was a system it seems to me that would be good so have a few minutes from different meetings so but i'm not about how much both different if a number of speakers different conditions not really it's so because of the limitations i was glad like to have some manually transcribed preferences for the system have i'm not if it's really good to bed with some other automatic asylum boundaries intuit trust them or if it's not the first i mean it's also i mean that's with me but in the first minute often there is that some strange things going on which on really for which already a really good so what i quite like press is to have some five minutes of different meanings i could do a restraining with that but i hope that i don't need to do it so it can be doing on supplies but i'm not about football for those three meanings me which i did it seems to be quite but that some it's that some problems with the and like perhaps we can do something with cross correlations to get rid of those that's what i'm that's my future recumbent what i want to do is look at the correlations so removing goes false overlapped and i'm not i'm if there are any what mike's in those meetings or i have to live having a good but i'm i think that's a no difference you know some n. f. a. meetings yes when he was how much time we said the meetings very and like what are we talking about in terms of the number of minutes you'd like to have as your training set now you're saying different meanings because the different speakers of because the different audio quality or both or the precision i know if we were to start with this and then tweak it had manually with that would be good how many minutes would you want from i mean we could easily get a section you know like say a minute or so from every meeting that we have so far from the newer ones were working on one that we have and then somewhere not in the very beginning five minutes and then someone she's from my interest information then would you be trait that crime is so would you be training then these segment or so that it could on the basis of that segment dress the meeting so they give you like five minutes is the idea that this would then be applied to two providing tighter and excellent so then if it's five minutes for me got like twelve minutes twelve meetings roughly done that i've been working with then i in terms of the speakers or the conditions in we have different combinations of speakers i mean just from what i've seen that there's somewhere your present or not present and then you have the difference between the networks group in this group we do no we could i mean you do record one last week or so i could get that new one we don't have that much variety in meetings at i mean we have this meeting in the future meeting we have a couple of others we have a couple examples of but potentially of the meetings that you're working with how many of them are different but are there any of them that are different than these two meetings yes makers so yes i didn't know in a group you had if you had that she have the networks meeting do you have any jerry's meetings near or no so current this week even really with the games differently the fact that i mean they could do the normalization yes if we could get a couple meetings done with that level precision i think that would be a good idea we can try renting we haven't done this yet because dress and it's going to move over the us or i recognize or around and machines sri because they're running these elves and instead of machine time there but once that's moved over hopefully in a couple days then we can take what changes told us about as the presented the dissemination that you did at level eight versus at some threshold attain that right and try doing forced alignment on the word strings and if it's good then that that may give you a good boundary of course if it's good we don't then we're fine but i don't know yet whether these segments that contain a lot of pauses around the words work or not right they might be it you know it really depends on a lot of things but i would have maybe a transcriber look at the result of a forced alignment and then adjust those that might save some time if they're horrible it won't help at all but they might not be horrible so but i'll let you know when we have that are the wireless different on the wired mikes at all i mean have you noticed any difference just a look pal versus everything else
was a system yes if we could get a couple meetings done with that level precision i think that would be a good idea
how much time
and like what are we talking about in terms of the number of minutes you'd like to have as your training set
the precision but once that's moved over hopefully in a couple days then we can take what changes told us about as the presented the dissemination that you did at level eight versus at some threshold attain that right and try doing forced alignment on the word strings and
which i hadn't thought about before but i was realizing

but in order to do that we need to extract out the actual digits
you know i mean they that they're interested in continuing working with it so i mean i
i you'd want models for spreading i think it might be
specific problems but so using ninetieth court file rather than
and i did some things like that interesting
renting we haven't done this yet because dress and it's going to move over the us or i recognize or around
around and machines sri because they're running these
the precision some threshold attain that right
how many minutes would you want from i
to the gravis i can't calculate in my

like this morning it's done so
you know someone fills out the form and then they're not at the meeting and so it's blank
use the hours for because they get the time that they be setting doing that they wouldn't be able to be putting more words on
so that's an indication that was with
how do we do on the t. i. digits the pros on x. are so much difference it's going to be
it's going to be strange
it was on its are not the same as t. i. digits for example
how so i'm not how much of effect that will have what do you mean
in the i don't know i think we one and a half percent two percent something like that

anyway this is not merchant thing it all just came up could be very interesting that
and and so i understand that's what you were saying about your problem with minimum i get it
and i had specific problems but i get it so using ninetieth court file
that's there are some problems in when and the channel their to so to speak it doesn't work my truck doesn't talk at
down some problems with them and listen to my station and the system doesn't work it'll so
form format and then you have all these things but across according to channel and then that means
not really it's so potentially they could
and i was going to take it from one of the new ones i can usually

and so forth the only thing is i'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena and the reason
also thought just listening name would get the hall into give us some advice on that
but i i was like you said and that's that much thought
right but i mean you like might be restricted but you also want to have coverage you know you right
and you can go from not from that to the particular ray features but that would be a better starting point for marking the jest real features then data where you don't have that because
parts and then we run it through that i'm going to edited and then but i read it to channel i switched takes and stay still parts form format and then you

that it had been randomized and so on and that's just what
how do that will have just what do you mean the presiding
just what we were talking about was grouping that
or i don't know what they're doing or are they reading actual phone numbers or a
or i don't know are they reading actual phone numbers

they were we should catch up on what's is
we said the meetings very and like what
the good example was an in breath where a transcriber working from the mixed signal doesn't know who's press it is and they've been assigning
and they've been assigning it to someone that may or may not be correct and
and what we do is if it's a brass on you know sound from the speaker we map it too annoys model like a mouse noise model and the recognize or and

so more typical my first like although the model's weren't that good right i mean
you're that good right i mean the models are pretty crappy
right i think that we could have done better on the models but the thing
because i don't think anybody is i at least i don't know

free and we only recently got it to anywhere near human like the single cell
there's no name for that so you have this feature here and overlap right but it still is
be something broader but that but where i'm coming from is were coming off the that they're assaulted with john talon regime entertainment which they have in a multi band system that is trained in combination ingredient learning and the m. too estimate the value from one for particular feature
you know i'm i mean if we're talking about having the and it caters annotate these kinds of features it seems like

that's a reasoning but
also thought you were thinking of a much more restricted set of features on that
i mean i was thinking that you would be interesting to do with respect to parts switchboard anyway in terms of
you know some n. f. a. meetings yes i didn't know in a group you had if you had that she have the networks

and he might end up with more closer correspondence
what it looks like it didn't look like a sequence of phones look like right
the harder ones
i mean was it depends how you look at it and i understand

sort of less predictability that it's just
because i've seen you know where does the voice bar start and so forth
or you could start from the if we were going to do the same set of sentences that steve had done we could start with those transcription that's
so i'm listened and on the nine that this morning and the barker room that home please and this afternoon

an interesting design too because then you have to cut the comparison of the predictable speech versus the less people speech and maybe you'd find because i don't think anybody is i at least i don't know i don't know that's you have to
i really meant place i see
so i'm glad that there is that the digitalk where everybody's supposed to say something so
we could i mean you do record one last week or so i could get that new one this week

something to really difficult
i actually think that there should be used for that maybe
good they might be it you know it really depends
down so it's precise i did so that should be faster than the ten times kind of thing

you know you should it should be such that if you if you had all all the features determined to tell you that you are you have chosen that would tell you in the study state case the phone right
i with vowels that would be pretty hard
identify actually you know which one it is
and we actually look at switchboard this out you see and and it i mean was and in fact the internet's here green it was not that good right on the harder ones it depends how

no name for that and overlap right but it still is
no i don't disagree with that and steve's type is fairly it's not that's low
don't disagree with it and you know anything is that what you actually within and end up with is something it's
right so the string that you end up with isn't actually what happened but it's

i think that's sort of qualitatively different right you can add those features and but it'll be under specified building be no
i think so too i wonder how would you first alignment my
the idea to unions want you to rate somehow
so that and so current

new version presentation
we want to say something about an update of see transcript what you summarize the
at all but they might not be horrible

it for their references that we need to go from the fancy transcript to the sort of brain dead
maybe they're using phone recognize or south of doing is they i thought that
these no i'm serious there all these

and then as you get really smart or the next year or two and you get better and then can preset by one or two percent
at work now but i think that steven gang or doing something with an automatic system first and then doing some adjustment that's
then of the meetings that you're working with how many of them are different but are there

and also it is contributing to be cut composition of the transcript because we can incorporate
all i'm saying is that it is useful to have that the transcription of what was really sad in which syllables were reduced
that home and this afternoon

it's my way of a order of magnitude we've been working with this or data set and the
and the best score on me nicest part of the data that is where you've got training in tests that are the same kinds of noise and so forth is about
so that they the point there and this is car noise things but real situations real

you right so if you were doing ten digits recognition really be in trouble you
the there's one microphone as close that they have is this sort of thing because versus distant
because the and then also if you did it on switchboard you would have the full continuum of transcription she'd have it from

but in a car instead of instead
of the new ones i can usually get them jerry feldman saying no problem
that first set so they're really running out of date it pretty i mean that's good

not i know what i mean it's connected disconnected digits it's connected
so there's also that not just the presidents across for knowing it's probably
but so there's also that not just the presidents across for knowing it's probably quite different

free prehistory to anywhere near human like the single cell you know
and it's still like an order of magnitude worse than like humans too right
when they're wide awake

after coffee
not after lunch so
so do then is all go ahead and enter this data

you can unpredictable have to think about the particular acoustic features to mark too because i mean some things they wouldn't be able to mark like you know ten slacks something
that might save some time if
some time if they're horrible it won't help at all but they might not

which are all like where your time comes to rest place of our place of articulation are
i mean i'm just the about of course we're just talking about what to provide is tool for people to do research have different ideas about how to do it so for instance
so for instance you might have someone who just has a word has words with states and has comes from articulate or gestures to that and someone

two steps one you know one is going from a dictionary pronunciation of something like going to see you tomorrow it could be going too or
going to you know one is going from a dictionary pronunciation of something like going to see you tomorrow it could be going too or a going to gun just and
and that it would be to these intermediate are these some of these reduced pronunciations that those transcribers markwardt have people mark those as

low i don't know
so it can be doing on supplies but
i was about to need to sign a new meeting and i was going to take it from one

i don't disagree with it and i don't know exactly what the timing was
i don't disagree with it and timing was
it's so it's a little different so i

right they overlap each other in weird ways so
it's not strictly one dimensional signal
so i think that's sort of qualitatively different right you can add those features and

like it's not that was over that was not we probably have a separate discussion about it whether you can do that
it seems like you could do both i mean i was thinking that was saying maybe meeting isn't the right corpus
anyways an hour and a half per that's really

you've got a good start on it but we don't have a
it but we don't have a really good meeting recorder recognize or transcribe or anything yet so
not really it's so because of the limitations potentially they could do the normalization

channels you have that from their transcription
about football for those three meanings me which i did it seems to be quite but
but that some it's that some problems with the and like

hopefully that's not the same meeting that we did
no actually stiffer meeting so i'm
meeting so i'm e. so the you know we have the they transcribe as if it's one channel with these with the flashes to separate the overlapping parts and

things and then we'll see if he others that were getting with that at that level are sufficient
and they don't need to be further broken down and if they do
and if they do need to be further broken down and maybe just be peace twice maybe it won't be a whole thing

and also all be and coding as i do my post editing the things that are in curly brackets what you're clarification material and
material and it to incorporate that keyword at the beginning so its going
so its going to be either gloucester is going to be a vocal sound like a laugh or a cough or so forth

so so i wanted to discuss
so right gender items so i wanted to discuss digits briefly but that one too

you know it's more pressing enough things
so anyway just in case once you get into this kind of realm even if you're looking at connected digits it can be pretty hard

things finally just do those yours
in there somewhere but i mean it's really it's close talking mike snow annoys clean signal just digits i mean every everything is good the beginning of time

and so we probably will be done with the t. i. digits and another couple of weeks depending on how many we read each time so
all these kinds of functional elements i don't know what you call them

but those are almost all filled in as and so
that but that's easy to handle at the post editing face i'll mention it to

on that and then presumably we should go to that just and like and stupidly right
the reason for doing it just because the argument is that certainly conversational speech the that we've looked at here before just doing the simple mapping from the phone to the corresponding features that you could look up in a book in right is

by one or two percent but
not really it's so potentially they could

so i this a description x. waves where did you select the portion is our
that's what i'm that's my future recumbent

that you know so it'll put on the screen the next that is six nine two
in terms of partly to see if you could generate first guesses at what the air ticket or a future would be based on the phone representation that lower level that might

right for coffee and i think it's a fine idea partly because it's not an unrelated to their present skill set but it
like that and i'm going to be doing a more thorough editing with respect to consistency of the conventions

a choice so are these two separate past that can happen
they but we discussed this morning i would summarize the saying that these units that results and it a particular channel on a particular time band at that level vary in length and

or do they have to happen same time before no they don't have this
but not just still pauses but all kinds of ways of interrupting and so forth and some

time before no they don't have this you have to enter the data before you do the second task but they don't have to happen at the same time
so forth and some other are husband

hours but it was an artificially add it to get some artificial sweeteners racially was just people driving
was just people driving around the car

that was with many sites competing in this is the very best score and so forth so more although the
so more typical my first like although the model's weren't

the models but the thing is that got this is it's kind of typical number for all of the things in this task all of the languages and so
and so i think it probably be the models be better in some than others

do we do on t. i. digits going to be different
but and it's more accurate than the dictionary and it's more accurate than phone labels and the word

free prehistory only recently got it to anywhere near human and like the single cell you know the beginning of life
you mean i don't think morgan suggesting that because it's not that easy to go from the dictionary word pronunciation the dictionary phone pronunciation to the gesture of one without this intermediate serviceable level kind of representation

it's definitely true that when people are reading even if they're rereading what they had said spontaneously that they have very different patterns submit show that
submit show that and some dissertations have shown that

an interesting design i don't know that's you have to
it and i understand what you're saying about this kind of transcription exactly because i've seen

seem to me that they points of articulation would be more i mean that's i
i mean that's i think about a ticket or teachers i think about points articulation which means rather than dolls

for that maybe although i think the meeting context it's great that he has transcription is they give you the actual phone sequence and
he didn't know what to say about what is the sequence of phones there they came up with some

you might be have that because we you want to know both about the way that they're producing a certain sound and what kinds of i mean anemic differences you get between these transcribed sequences and the dictionary ones
you might be right some of it might be the way at getting it what i was talking about that particular ones

about that particular reason why i was interested in doing that was because i remember when that happened and so i was over here and he was looking at the specter grams of the more difficult ones
ever recall so i mean that's

going it could be going too or a going to gun just and
deceived tomorrow deceived and

to that and someone else might actually want some fanatic you know intermediate thing so
don't give you because if you add them to the dictionary you run recognition you had confusion the people

here and they could be overlapping and all sorts of bizarre ways that don't correspond to the timing on phones
and but still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which was actually phones or not he would necessarily

i mean this is a kind of reason i remember
a kind of reason i remember when it's one of the switchboard workshops that when we talked about doing the transcription project they've talked and so it can't be done right

no i don't disagree with that and steve's type is fairly
i think that's actually what i was thinking that the problem

has three or four this might have been the fifth one that you ruined or whatever so so it's like a continuum it's you're going all right
that you ruined or whatever so so it's like a continuum it's you're going all right

it's just having multiple levels of information and marking the other differences where made e. boise right
the other differences that the teachers are not synchronized right they overlap right

building be no way for you to actually mark what was said completely by features
not with our current system but you could imagine designing a system that the states were features rather than phones and if you're

not he would necessarily have to
and this week i get that anyone and because i we're going to be recording them every monday

the question is do they do that on meeting data or do they
data or do they do that on switchboard that's what i

and you could tell you know the phonetic level that steve did in that's all i was thinking that it is telephone
and you could tell that and you get the relative gain it's so it's a little in it'd be a complete set thinking that it is telephone band so the bandwidth might be

so i mean that's probably the right way to go anyway is to start off with the automatic system with a pretty rich enunciation dictionary that you know tries to label at all
and then people go through and fix it

so in our case you'd think about it started with maybe the regular dictionary entry
and then or would be regular addiction

recognize or south of doing they i thought that they were we should
to it and then as we get further down the road you can do more things ahead of time we can do some of the same things to me today

maybe need to do some fanatic features these nine word words
word words or are these kinds of where the people never the husband and these

conditions we don't have that much variety in meetings at i mean
at i mean we have this meeting in the future meeting we have a couple of others we have a couple examples of but

intuit trust them or but i would have maybe a transcriber look at the result of a forced alignment and then adjust those that might save
to the gravis actually stop with the transcribing you meetings or how they

with also see we were thinking maybe applying that to getting paid
that'll be very useful to getting overlaps to be more precise only through

and so i mention the process that i'm going through with the data so you
with the data so you know i get the data back from the transcript i'm in fort lee get the day back and transcriber and then

and they recognize your would prefer that the then it's not be overly long but it's really an empirical
but it's really an empirical question whether the units we get at this point true just that process i described might be sufficient for them so

we just needed away to strips you know all the comments all the things that the linguist wants but they recognize or can't do anything with
but to keep things that we map to like reject models or you know mouth noise or cost and

gender items

were enough to presuming fishing new

say something about an update what you summarize the

i'm transcripts and

and i that includes some the filtering for that to s. r. s.

it be recap of a meeting that we had time like this morning sort of brain dead it's done

on the digits goes up to about four thousand

time so they were a bunch that we skipped you know someone fills

so we'll have and so what's it's done it would be very trapper recognize earn actually start working with this data and so

so we'll have a corpus that's the size of jet digits data and so one

jet digits test one particular test that of t. i. digits

that so i extracted there was a file sitting around which people have used here as a test that it had

great so on and that's just what i used to generate the order of these particular ones

some incredible we could do is take the standard training set for t. i. digits train up output whatever you know great teachers we think we have for instance and then test on this test that and

this test that and presumably she do reasonably on that and then

you get better and then can preset by one or two percent

it tells you what the next one should be and you just look for that you know so it'll

so this and you find that and hit the key in record in a file in a particular format and so the

so this is and so the question is should we have the transcribers do that or should we just do it with some

of us i've been do i've done eight meeting something like that just by hand

just myself rather

so it will not take long

is that we discuss this right for coffee and i

so you think it's fun to have to transcribe mister there's

there's one other small bit which is just entering the information which it's which is at the top of this form onto the computer to go along with the where the digits are recorded automatically

and so it's just you know typing in name times time date and so on

which again either they can do but it is you know firing up an editor or i can do or someone

and that do or someone else can do

and that you know i'm not that one i'm not so fits into the things that wanted to use the hours for because else can do

but that's really a choice so are these

so it's just i have a file with which has this information on it and then when you start using my scripts for extracting the times it has the times at the bottom of the file

and so i mean it's easy to create the files and leave them blank so actually we could do it in either order

it's sort of to have the same person do it just as a double check to make you're entering for the right person but

i think the best score was something like five percent air per digits

instead of having a projector it's it's current hours

can be fun to see how we compare to

how do we do on the t. i. digits the pros on x. are so much difference

that but sees the grouping there's no grouping at all and so it's just the only sort of just this do you have is at the beginning and the end so what are they

or so what are they doing in aurora are they reading actual

i don't know what they're doing or a digit at a time

how do we do on t. i. digits but in t. i. digits they're reading things like zip codes and phone numbers and things like that so it's going to be different quite different

how but in t. i. digits they're reading things like zip codes and phone numbers and things like that so it's quite different

how do we do on t. i. digits things like that so it's going to be different

i mean we were in the one and a half

i don't know i think we got under percent two percent something like that

but was but it's but i mean the very best system that i song literature was a point two five percent or something and somebody had a at bell labs are but sort of pulling out all the so i think a lot of systems really

it strikes me that they're more each of them is more informative because it's so random and that people might articulate i mean the very best system that i song literature was a point two five percent or something and somebody had a at bell labs are but sort of pulling out all the so i think a lot of systems sort of get half percent of course percent we're in there somewhere when they're wide awake after coffee or not after lunch one question i have the i mean we would know the answer to now but like do some guessing but i was talking before about doing some art modeling work marking of articulate tori teachers we overlap and so on and on some subset one thought might be to do this on the digits or someplace the digits it'd be easier and so forth the only thing is i'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena and the reason for doing it just because the argument is that certainly conversational speech the that we've looked at here before just doing the simple mapping from the phone to the corresponding features that you could look up in a book in right is actually right in fact there's these overlapping process person forcing comes up and then some you know some nationalities comes in here and so forth and you do this gross things saying i if this phone starting there so that's a reasoning but it could be that when we're reading digits because it's for such a limited set that maybe that time in this incur as much i don't know did if they give me been opinion about that free prehistory right but i mean it's really it's close talking mike snow annoys clean signal just digits i mean every everything is good yes exactly and we only recently got it to anywhere near human and it's still like an order of magnitude worse than like humans too after coffee so do then is all go ahead and enter this data and then hand off jane and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits the beginning of time and speech recognition like the single cell you know the beginning of life right

percent we're in there somewhere but i mean it's

mean every everything is good yes exactly the beginning of time and speech recognition

and then hand off jane and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits

one question i have the i mean we would know the answer to now but like do some guessing but i was talking before about doing some art modeling work marking of articulate tori teachers we overlap and so on and

one thought might be to do this on the digits or someplace the digits it'd be easier

it'd be easier and so forth the only thing is

actually right in fact there's these overlapping process person forcing comes up and then some you know some nationalities comes in here and so forth and you do this gross

that's a reasoning but it could be that when we're reading digits because it's for such a limited set that maybe that time in this incur as much i don't know

it strikes me did if they give me been opinion about that

and that people might articulate more

sort of less predictability that's i agree that it's just

sort of less predictability that it's just

an interesting design see i don't know so they maybe the single beach do take some very small subset and i have a big program or take a small set subset of the conversation speech in a small subset of the digits and look and just get a feeling for it just take a look really because i don't think anybody is i at least i don't know i don't know that's you have to would this corpus really be the right one to even try that on it's definitely true that when people are reading even if they're rereading what they had said spontaneously that they have very different patterns submit show that and some dissertations have shown that so the fact that they're reading first of all whether they're reading and i'm a room of people or read you know just the fact that they're reading will make a difference and it depends what you're interested in

would this corpus really be the right one to even try that on it's definitely true that when people are reading even if they're rereading what they had said spontaneously that they have very different patterns submit show that and some dissertations have shown that so the fact that they're reading first of all whether they're reading and i'm a room of people or read you know just the fact that they're reading will make a difference and it depends what you're interested in

and look and just get a feeling for it

for it just take a look really

speech and maybe you'd find it worked in and see case with if you can unpredictable have to think about

points of articulation what to me

so is it by late deal or dental or is it which

your time comes to rest place of our place of articulation are

which are all like where your time comes to rest place of our are

thank you what reversed said this i really meant place i see

regard jurgen

it's also there's really a difference between the pronunciation malls in the dictionary and the presentations that people produce and so

produce and so you get some of that information from steve's work on the labeling and it really

there they came up with some compromise

because that really wasn't what it looks like it right

of phones look like this blending thing happening here there's so you have this feature here

here there there's no name for that so you have this feature here and overlap right but it still is

but it still is there's that there two steps one

you mean i don't think morgan suggesting that we do that though representation

thing so i think it would be best to have all that if we could

what i'm imagining as a score like notation where each line is a particular feature right so you

right so you would say you know it's a voice through here and see of label here you know and nasal here and

he was what we meant was that this isn't you know sequence of phones and we actually look

out you see and and in fact the internet's here green it was not that good right on

the people purposely don't add them

so it would be great if we had so it's useful to know which marian was produced at least at the phone level

so it would be great if we had either these kind of labelling on the same portion switchboard steve mark or steve type markings on this with these the phone level right that's exactly

but it's the best compromise is a group people scratching or has to come up with to describe what happened and it's more

but and it's more accurate than the dictionary or if you've got a pronunciation electric on that has three or four this accurate than phone labels and the word

the way down that's what i meant is and

meant is and in some places that would fill in of the kind of just real features are not everywhere so

you know what phone it wasn't that's about all you can i can say and then there are other cases

it's just having multiple levels of say and then there are other cases where made e. boise right

like it's not that was over that was not comes direction i time so i mean we probably have a separate discussion about it whether you can do that

i time so i mean what where this is i mean i wonder would like to have something it's useful to people other than those who are doing specific kind of research i have a nine so should

i have a nine so should be something broader but

and this is part of a larger image to chinatown has but how the human brain doesn't which is sort of imagining that individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate of these kinds of something like this might not be you know expect

might not be you know expect teachers tickets and saddam or something

and saddam or something but i mean you know some something like that some kind of low

like that some kind of low level features which are not fully you know phone classification and

and the that this particular image how the how it's done is that then given all of these estimates at that level there's a level above it with and which is making some kind of sound unit classifications which is you know and you

and you know you could argue what goes on there should be and so forth but that's

so forth but that's sort of what i was imagining doing

but again i wouldn't want to what we produce to be so local and perspective that it was matched what we were thinking of doing one week and

one week and you know what you're saying is right that if

was saying maybe meeting isn't the right corpus

lower level that might be a time game

but also in terms of comparability of

and you could tell she'd have it from the lowest level that the because the teachers and you have you know the phonetic level that steve did in that's all i was thinking that it is telephone

that and you get the relative gain it'd be a complete set band so the bandwidth might be

and you get the relative gain it's so it's a little set the bandwidth might be

different so i mean know we'll see what how much we can get people to do and how much people have and all that sort of thing but it might be

and all that sort of thing but my they do both but it might be good to do what jane was thing and you know seated with guesses about what we think the features are based on you know the phone or steve's transcription or something to make it quicker parts to based on the phone

make it quicker just think exactly parts to based on the phone transcripts they would all be synchronized but then you could imagine nudging them here and there

think exactly nudging them here and there

to voicing over little because right

i think with i mean i'm a little behind in what they're doing now and the they're doing into at work now but i think that because right

and then or would be regular addiction i mean is a pretty rich dictionary it's got

dictionary it's got a different interpretation or you could start

thinking that the problem is when you run if you run a regular dictionary even if you have variance in there most people don't you'd always get out the actual pronunciation so that's

actually maybe they're using phone pronunciation so that's why the human transcribers giving you the that sensation is they

yes i think that if we also don't have i mean you've got a good start on a good

so i mean other way look at this is too is to do some and switchboard which has all this other to it and

and these people might they are most of them are trained with i. p. they'd be able to

coding or are they busy for the next couple of years

i'm just acoustic teachers

i don't know what you call them but not just still

grunts that

might be interesting

he's got lip smacks going to meetings

new version of pretty segment tasting

i wrecked a little bit on a presentation to get another version bitch dazs channel specific speech on speech detection

and what i it is use the last few trips bitch looking into it and it was just the last entry into and the penalized by them mean over the channels and by the minimum over the

and to him too you have to know what i saw this and i'm my about this and things and that those features that you are ninety tractor

and it to be able to somewhat distinguish between foreground and background speech in the difference in each channel

so that's grateful for my purpose

and the thing is i you know nation off the system is a little bit hot as i don't have any reference we did the hand the

that's the one in know but when i do the training on so i kind of the other nation on

so the thing is candid transcribe this perhaps to some meetings in terms of speech and on beach and in the specific channels you

so now any so no because i mean it really tight

so now any so no because i mean it really tight

great i think i might have done what you're requesting though i didn't in the service of even think i

of even think i have thirty minutes that i it's more tightly transcribe with reference to individual channels

because his interface allows me to have total flexibility time tags across channels and

so that's great but being to have some more meetings not trust one meetings too to be that there was a system yes when he was so current yes if we could get a couple

even really with the games differently the fact that i mean

because of the limitations do the normalization

we can try renting we haven't done this

because they're running these elves and instead

elves and instead of machine time there but once

i was glad like to have some manually transcribed preferences for the system have i'm not if it's really good to bed with some other automatic asylum boundaries i know if we were to work or not right

intuit trust them or at the result of a forced alignment

how many minutes so but i'll let you know when we have that

mean we could easily get a section you know like say a minute or so from every meeting that we have so far from the newer ones were working on one that we have

if it's not the first i mean it's also i mean that's with me but in

me but in the first minute often there is that some strange things going on which on really for which already a really good

so what i quite like press is to have some five minutes of different meanings

somewhere not in the very beginning five minutes

and then someone she's from my interest information then

information then would you be trait

so would you be training then these segment or so that it could on the basis of that segment dress the meeting so they give

i could do a restraining with that the meeting so they give you like five minutes is the idea that this would then be applied to two providing tighter and

i could do a restraining with that providing tighter and

but i hope that i don't need to do it

the and like perhaps we can do something with cross correlations to get rid of those

future recumbent what i want to do is look at the correlations so removing goes false overlapped

and are the wireless different on the wired mikes at all i mean have you noticed any

and i'm not i'm i mean have you noticed any difference

and i'm not i'm if there are any what mike's in those meetings or i have to live having a good but i mean have you noticed any difference

having a good but i'm i think that's a no difference

just a look pal versus everything else

so then if it's five minutes for me got like twelve minutes twelve meetings roughly done that i've been working with then of the meetings

different but are there any of them that are different than these two meetings

i in terms of the speakers or the conditions in yes makers

we have different combinations of speakers i mean just so

i mean just from what i've seen that there's somewhere your present or not present and then

you know some n. and then you have the difference between the networks group in this group yes i didn't

you know some n. f. a. meetings yes i didn't know in a group you had if

we do you had that she have the networks meeting

no do you have any jerry's meetings near or

i could get that new one and this week i get that anyone and this week we're going to be recording them every

great because i think he really needs variety and monday

great and having as much variety for speaker certainly would be a big part of that

became clued includes

includes then i if i were to include altogether samples from twelve meetings that would only take an hour and i could get the

take an hour and i could get the transcribers do that right

i mean what i mean is that would be an hour sampled and then they transcribe those that hour right that's

that's i mean transcribe i mean right but your you

i mean adjust so they get into you

adjust so they get into the multi channel format and then adjust the time down so it's precise so that should be faster than the ten

i did so last night i did

last night i did about half an hour and three hours which is not terrific but

they're still working and they still have enough to finish that i haven't assigned a new meeting but

a new meeting but the next they i was about to need

they're around they're less reason makes a decision that we should go over and start transcribing the other so

you're the first time

yes it does this but nicely into the update on transcripts

interested into the afternoon concerning this issue the it's the shitty interplay between the transcript format and be processing it they need to do for the answer i recognize her

and transcriber and then i check for simple things like spelling errors and things like that and

but they're generally very good and

for them so as a first pass through the first chance without having to do a lot of hand editing what we're going to do is all run through channel eyes give in those days after it on the other team cross i'm it's clean i can do that

it's clean i can do that pretty quickly with just that minimal editing without having to have a break things and then

also we discuss meditation and things so then lots of right

it's like god you know i hadn't incorporated a convention explicitly to handle acronym for example but if someone

example but if someone says p. m. it would be to have that be directly interpret herbal from the transcript what they said or pick

what they said or pick articulate p. c. l. i mean so you

i mean so you it's and so i've incorporated also convention with that but that's easy to handle

face i'll mention it to transcribers for the next day so that's

and then a similar con convention for number so they say one eight

so they say one eight reverses one eight three

or non vocal sound like a doors slamming that can be easily done with you know just a little like additional thing and the general forum

and then there's this interesting issue chain brought up which i hadn't thought about

before but i was realizing as i went through the transcripts that there's some noises like

and the recognize or and probably doesn't hurt that much once in a while they have these but if
