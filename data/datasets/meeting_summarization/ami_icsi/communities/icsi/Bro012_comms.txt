it's pretty it's not ever of here filter
some things are going to be hurt
i because they wanted to move it you there
we could move us
so we put together all these and we have resolves
and we have resolves that's on up very impressive
and it's better latency right not
match case but i think we are like could hear bide this program that
instance freaked out and this at seventy eight percent commission rate and the mismatch and these new
and these new system is eighteen nine
i don't think it indicates something
right this is italian right so
but i mean from d. c. seventy eight percent commission rate system i could change the transition probably for the the first h. m. between that and up to eighteen nine so
that and it's really worked really happened
probably supposed to be before five point six i think you're not allowed to
only tested it on the media mismatch and on their training set i mean
right you said on the other cases you didn't notice i think i think
i did notice something i think the mismatch is the more difficult for the training
worked out and i just for the for most of the
for the digit models they and that's three mixtures per state
and it didn't have or any significant effect as the media mismatch in high mismatch cases and i had
i mean to do one turnaround of the matched case takes like a day
and if i do running extra right now where i'm changing the number of iterations from seven to three to see
and if it's not a huge difference from running with seven iterations you know we should be able to get a lot more experiments done
but they're not making things worse and we have reduce latency right
but actually actually seems to do what he the big twirls for the when much gays
and we just no taste that
but i what happened is that if you have a small improvement small it's on the web much gays you could have you would you through ones and being proven on compared to the reference because the reference
so it waits the improve manuel match case really heavily compared to the improvement on the other cases no but
the other cases no but it's a waking up two of the improvement nothing that ever
nothing that ever rates
and it's hard to improve on the best case because it's
the best case because it's already so good
and been in that aspect of the finest gore almost
they said almost nothing to find this girl because she improvement because the improvement read i tasted it debated ninety smoltz
so they do improvement in terms of accuracy rather than worker right
improvement no
but it but when you look at the numbers are sense of the relative size of things is quite different because see i mean i see
if you had ninety percent correct and five percent five over ninety
no point six percent absolute and italian
so there is first these thing and then the
the moment they're working on degrading specter subtraction you from ericsson
and some of the pictures you're looking at there was a lot of light
i was just going to say isn't there and aren't there lots of ideas for doing voice sick kennedy or speech non speech rather by looking at you know i harmonic or know
speech even with the iowa
to be in that's something that small relate to define structure of the spectrum
so i don't know we were thinking about like using ideas from every soul
we've actually back and chuck was here we did some poison voiced classification using bunch of these
voice twenty you can't you know affect though situations or anything

in that way but it's still is it's a real thing that we did get out of the microphone distance so it wasn't
were but i think i was trying to figure out what's the best way to show the difference and i had a couple thoughts one was that
so one thing to do might be just take a piece of the specter gram where you can see that something looks different and
and blow it up have that be the part is just to show as
very impressive there's no real improvement
so from point six point five and you get ten percent better
so it's a live bits on the when match
but i we don't have company trees out but
six system
is yes it could be for the first time
the constraints of this task we can't in a very way feed forward to recognize or information but probably

the lovely see how different these sequences of numbers
or i could just add them up and get a different total
by using point five instead of point six point four each case chris
i looked at look at the results one and did that and it's
but in sort of makes my skate everything is using the far microphone training and testing
so of started looking at a lot of numbers and getting sensible was important i see
morgan do you remember that signet for a gram that we used to use for testing to is that still valid
the see rope army truce for you daddy in but the rounds
that's the first order but the but it may help first order
it just so happens that the e.'s were more you know recorded when thee energy was larger or something or the
some bias so that if you're moving the sources of fury ability in the data that has nothing to do with the linguistic gotcha

look at the spectrum or from that you get out of there
frames so that they look at like one instant in time
so i wanted to experiment with cutting down the number of iterations before i increased the number of counseling
but we've got disgusted that
can i ask them what this variance normalization do what
some principle you i see
we different system
no is no if you ever know for you know you could be taken for our speech
they make these mistakes but so

in general we like to do that because of things like this
somebody he was morgan suggested at the last meeting that i actually count to see how many parameters and how many frames and
if we saw that making a small change like you know it tends to be self loop had a huge effect can we really make any conclusions about differences and that's
because it's a vacation
q. sent this all a copy of the message
i'm not exactly what the gist of what he was saying but
gist of what he was saying but something having to do with the voice activity detector in that it will
what you could do maybe is should do you so if you have if you view this second strain

point one five and we go to ninety three point sixty one
they're trying to do something with making recorded digits
but there's also special session about or which is
which is an extended so the
i think you know i my initial thought
of quite a bit the main thing that struck me in looking at the specter grams was the difference in the high frequencies hook like
right hook like for the one i was farther you know really everything was anyway waited

and for the wedding match they are around one six percent
first i think there's something where he was having some trouble getting so much and they're i forget the
know it's like if you're doing image processing and
you know you'd want to adjust to that nordic compare things and the very
where what stages the boy security detector applied is
a distraction it applied here or after the various normalization or that
i mean thee

rate it's so we can mean off improvements
of smoking ban when they called crap
do you remember when the next meeting
so we should find out if it's really better mean if it's
the comparison small big that's

no that's so when we look at these error rate
there's just some filtering
is the effect of that
and some there was low light you know you'd want to
and then voice so normal high frequencies

the i it's the theater
it that trying to i noticed that in the pictures i think you know i
and when there is no online or my addiction
he figured
i look at the chili that perhaps a good place keep detectors is good before and i my edition and

because there's many features there are still preserved so
but if we can you know run all of these back ins with many fewer iterations and on linux boxes we should be able to get a lot more experimenting down
so we are getting hurt someone in is that
that's but for the visual just you know i'd like to have you know the specter gram again because your

what's what're according to the rules what are we supposed to do about the transition probably supposed
it's supposed to point six it's supposed to be point six so
works it's not perfect
but probably stick information that you might get about whether it's western voice twenty

said on the other cases you didn't notice i think
the reason he's i and it
question i mean i think also the fact that the mismatch he's trained only this far microphone
so you don't have this program if look i mean movie probably and for

we probably should have standardized and all the way through
but the that but i mean it's ask you something is if any news
we would try m. s. g.
so but some kind of smoking ban

always to was thinking that maybe she flew tools seeing about police i'm the all these
to walk i mean like some place that they seem
we it and they seen and my feeling is that
seen and my feeling is that actually when we look at all the proposals everybody's still using some kind of spectrum how's it

if anybody knows go check
so we're doing all these things using a software there is
this effect so you can do that by doing was voice two detection also could

i mean recognizes looking frames so like
that didn't improve things in a way to convince too it substantially improved anything but
but as soon as we have something that's thing that account that's her down and episode make it

assignment ice size i see
we are exchanging made soon significant results
so i mean you could that's why i was thinking is section like that you could take a look at this that part of the specter granny say this

you want to i see i don't mean a graph i mean the actual numbers
a lot to me and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time i mean to do
and so if we can get away with just doing three we can do many more experiment's more quickly and if

it's not the square
whereas forth i mean you snatch training is down microphone so
difference but i've over ten minutes it's been so

i don't i think it means that you see things more robust
with i mean it is you know how much very hurt no i
very hurt no i better example would be how much of the light was coming in from outside rather

chancellor percent difference in the word aerate
from point even tenth person
is there any further discussion about this idea of having some sort of source code control

i'm for i'm from reaching the point want but we try went one
for i'm from reaching the point want and then we try went one
and then not ten service and one ten

like five percent absolute
speech is more what it seems that after spectra subtraction speeches smart emerging that and than before whether
i think they went to work in the second stream so but

so if you have ten percent there and you get five percent absolutes improvement then that's fifty percent
four and you go to ninety four point four
that are not if there's strong harmonic structure you can throw away it's not how harmonic

for of me snatched they are on like the two one point five percent
so it's almost like everything's held up waiting for this one thing i don't know if that's
the next in june it's saying june

i used it
i used it a long time ago but it's been
where's but the fact is that device security sector doesn't work on jen one so

they're i forget the reason behind it but
and so we would like to actually see voice coming into since
detection also could do it i suspect destruction before the france no a edition right

she i think we should ask which he
she i think that she say we did goat a probably keep
so we should find out if it's really better mean if it's the comparison

about that we had a guy here some years ago who did some work on making use of voicing information to help in reducing the noise
so what he was doing is you do estimates pitch
or you asked me if i how my structure maturity either

where this came up was that i was showing off this way forms that we have on the web and
good match but it certainly was still an indication of the fact that you get no it's assistant mike's

range because i know although you start off with thirty two bits you end up with a sixteen bits and
funny it's not the mean of word ever rate it's not the way

bits and you know are we getting hurt there but dance
no it's compared to the whatever it's improvements on the whatever right

here whether we should change a capacitor on put box for that or
for that or whether we should he suggested

but then i had some other thing discussions and the a.'s
simple thing to do is he

depending on the option that our suffers being runways it's quite possible that's already being taken care of
know we can approximate the old numbers still keeping the latency down

if you look at you could just
so which means that actually do weights on the wedding match

saying either spectrum recapture but
spectrum recapture but i think the thing is you want to i don't mean a graph i

i just of say the remark why i'm
percent five over ninety does look like it's a big difference but

and also and do they show so that
you know the d. shoe that forty online or my station

i could that they're teams
that they're teams better when we look at demi's match case but

that in some cases when you money fives tonight secondly fighting other condition you end up completely somewhere asking that the space the permeate or so
the others just them amount friends instance freaked out and this

so then if you take your changes and then it's i mean our father that's
then if you take your changes and then it's i mean our father that's but i mean

i mean are the only difference is you change the south loop transition probably buy a tenth of a percent really a
chancellor percent and it causes ten percent difference in the word aerate

so from point five
so it does get better you know looks ugly

i think it's what you hypothesized in the last meeting about just being very i think you mentioned this in
a better match i think you know if we make a better silence model i think that will help a lot too

but even if you use point five i'm not it's too always gives you the better results on other tests
right we on other tests that's so

and less than forty thousand parameters in the baseline system
i did one quick experiments to make i had everything worked out and i just

because it's forty five i mean you could have
is if you have a good voice activities sectors and she's in a kind pull that out

he's only four times as many parameters and i think also
so if there's an overall reason you

and they do a final set a seven and a quit
seven seems like a lot to me and

i carried away the science course scores computed it's quite funny it's not the mean
did the number that our here are recon mission experiments on neat that in h. m. and with these two kinds of farming person

but what i mean east that you can is a huge improvement on the h. and gain
i think we can be completely fooled by this thing but

differences and that's
just are different so

and with some people from my g. working on paper for these but there's also
because it's real obvious thing that you hear two voices but not reverberations

once the deadline i think it's the thirteenth may
whether the difference between the energy of the speech and the energy of been specter supply subtracting portion she's larger

but i think it's probably on some from what and saying it's unlikely to get sort of active participation two cents to talk to the i could
i could at least

over the web that seems to be very popular way of people distributing changes and over you know multiple sites and things so maybe
the second one and down here maybe we could just like talking to

great and if you're interested in using c. v. s. i set it up here so
form it's just the first i think there's something

way for me and i can talk a little bit some point but the better demonstration of the saxon reverberations for where page so
i mean it not it sounds pretty river but i mean

you have to if you look at closely see here's a place where this one has a big foreman it
it the informant major form it's here are moving quite a bit and then you look and the

that was the main visual thing that i notice
so they're clearly are structural effect since you're getting

it's perfect because you can
and the sentence something on the one world which is doing

it's easier with a close talking the close so
talking the close channel

this is still but also what happens on the noisy portion is that the parents something is
i think it's easy to do better because it doesn't

and the very it's just sort of like the next moment you know
so what if one set of pictures was taken so that throughout the course it was one to daylight and night ten times another time

every all of the parameters
and some principle you your move that source then you know you can i see so would the major

could just get used not the same but
no use of pitch

but what happens is that after expect inspection you also increase the variance of this it's easier so
so upright

i think we went to work and they also want to work
and they also want to work and do some

as teachers just smoke after
and you incorporate the different v. h. d.'s and

so they better on which use it i mean
can't work and everything

next back in the country
start organizing more visits and connections and so forth and

that you know even with voice none bush than waste
as a good advice detect or

sing so i think if we try to up the second stream
my voice speech detector that's working

larry
in that it will people shouldn't put their own or something was going to be

so so compute the variance i resolution spectrum
so many decision about that we

but the thing is that can't get rid of things that are not if
before you do kale peace and so forth

so that's an interesting mail from down ellis actually

down ellis actually i think he re directed to everybody also so

also so d. p. a. mike's i have a big bunch of energy at five hurts

have on the web and i just sort of have noticed this but the major component in they way in the second way for him and a pair reforms is actually the air conditioner

after we're careful about using that as a as a good illustration in fact

in fact it's not of the sexes reverberations british is

british is isn't a bad illustration of the effects of room noise some bikes

and then we have this other discussion about whether this affects the dynamic range because i know

but dance pretty confident that we're not that connotation errors that some amount a significant

so was a question of whether we should change things here whether we should

whether we should right he suggested a smaller capacitor right for the

discussions and the feeling was once we start my came with that many other problems could have happened and

and additionally we already have a lot of data this collected that so

is he has i forget if this was in that or in the following mail but he has

mail but he has a simple filter that you felt that he suggested we just

we just run over the data for we deal with it

the other thing i don't know the answer to but when people are using seek out here whether they're using it with a high pass filter option

i don't know if anybody knows

if it's based on the rest guilty program which does both guilty and drastic guilty there is an option there which then comes up through the few calc which a lot of junior high test filtering in general we like

filter doesn't affect speech frequencies even pretty low

even pretty low speech frequencies at all but it's

what's he cutoff frequency frequencies

i don't know i wrote this a while ago was like twenty

i mean i think there's some effective of twenty but it's

but it's it's mild

i mean it probably just for some affect up to a hundred hertz or something but it's pretty

i don't know in the strut implementation of the is there i test filter are pretty emphasis or something

i think we use a preempt these

so we want to go and check that and for anything they were going to use to be a mike for

and he says that there's a pretty good roll off and they pgm so

so you know they need to worry about them one way or the other but if we do make use

but if we do make use of the cheap bikes we want to be to do that filtering before we process and then

but i also have to pick a different picture so the affection for british

did somebody it during your talk

since i was talking about reverberations showing this thing was noise it wasn't a good match but it certainly

it's just not a great example because i only isn't reverberations it's annoys that we definitely know what to do something it

something it doesn't take deep i knew bold new methods to get rid of five hurts it's so

but so it was a bad example in that way but it's

so it wasn't it was wrong it was inappropriate

if someone noticed it later right now to man man

and i noticed that

so i think we'll change our picture on the web and they were but i think i was

one was that specter ground that we show is but the thing

but the thing is i is and behind them so good at picking out patterns from no lines that in first glance you look at them

you look at them it doesn't seem like it's that bad

another i was thinking of was taking some slices

like bikes we look at with recognizing

the reverberations does make it does change that

and so maybe that would be more obvious

spectra spices

frames so that they look at you know look at like one instant in time

it's at one point in time or twenty over twenty no seconds or something you have a spectrum or custom assignment

you look at you could just throw up you know he some m. s. c. feature victors

you know one from one for the other and then you know you can look and see how different the numbers are

the remark why i'm wondering why the p. d. so far i mean we were

i i mean we were always making it beginning of the table you there

seems that thing we've tried to put together the clean no pass to think of something i mean

then you or that's replacing the india scissors

but it's not were worse and it's better it's not

the fact that

the test will be if you then try to you know one of the other ten cents

think you mentioned this in your you know too it's just

you know you get stuck in some local minimum and this

and this thing throws you out of it i

it's supposed to point six so but

but changing into point five i think is

which gives you much better results but

better results but that's not allowed

right we only tested it on the media mismatch right you that's so and on their training set i mean

i think the reason he's

microphone so it's can speech

and for the wedding match it's it makes us microphone in houston

i did notice something i think the mismatch

and there are almost one twenty million frames of training data

so it's very few parameters compared to how much training data

so that says that we could have lots more rounders actually i

and so i just did a quick fix i changed it so that went to four and

high mismatch cases and i had was just barely significant for the match better

because it's forty so time it's going to run that again but with many more mixtures per state

and i think also just seeing what we saw in terms of the expected duration of the silence model when we did the speaking

when we did the speaking of self loop

the silence model expected ration was really different and so in the case where

and so in the case where it had a better score the silence model expected is much longer it was

longer it was like it was a better match i think

a lot of these cases

but one thing i wanted to check out before i increased the number mixtures per state what is in there do you training script they do an initial set of three rearrested the nations and

and then they build the silence model and then

model and then they do seven iterations then they add mixtures they

add mixtures they do another seven then they had mixers

and so you know in trying to run these experiments i notice you know it's difficult to find machines you know compute to run on and so one

run on and so one of the things i did was i compiled h. t. k. for the linux machines because

machines because we have this one for my b. and it's got like five processors in it

and so now i'm you can run on that and that really helps a lot because now we've got you know extra machines that we can use for compute and

to three to see how it affects the baseline system and so

so you know what happens with that but if we can

rate it's not the way can mean if we're ever rate it's so we can

reference because the reference systems he's quite good for my much gays also

so what you're saying then is that if it's something that has a small word error rate then a even a relatively small improvement on it an absolute terms showbiz quite large and is that

but that's that's the notion of relative improvement

but when you think about the way thing we just point five point three point two it's an absolute i don't read it to figures not

no that's why i've been saying we should be looking at where they're right and not a and actors it's

i mean it's not that different i mean just attract

but i mean just attract because see i

wet anyway so

like it's difficult to say because

difficult to say because again

is that still valid i've been using

i was actually updated

updated jeff updated some years ago and was all should

ago and clean it up made things better now

so i should find that new one i just use my

i'm it's one i just use my home one from ninety two or

i'm it's not that different but he or

but he he was a little more rigorous as i recall

so it's around

would we start from ninety four point sixty four and you go

that's six point ninety three point six

six point ninety three point six four

to be nine you mean but i don't

i'm but i don't i'm not talking about the big thing i my

i'm i my the nineties it submit system just

finish we stopped in ninety three point eight before and we go to ninety three

and we go to ninety three point seventy four

and for spanish we are we where it's ninety five point one five and

you know what piece you done several changes here

trees out but the or so it's or read a short thirty eight or it's on the italian one match

the other things like done something attempting don't seemed to work and

i'm work and then you online or my addition either so

i'm really confused about something if we

i mean especially when the small i mean

i computed like the confidence level on the different that's and

for the women it h. and there are so wrong one point five

but say the these degradation so we're talking about we're on the match case

did it this the new filter make things better or worse for the other case

there's never does get a little better or something

so i the argument on my neck is that if you look at one of these cases and you tickle something it changes then you're not quite what to make of it but when you look

to make of it but when you look across a bunch of these and there's some pattern

and so he hears all the if in all these different cases it never gets better and there's significant number of cases where it gets worse than you probably many things so

so meet the very least that would be a reasonable prediction of what happened with a different tests at the turn taking things

so i the question is if you can do better than this know we can

so what i was asking there our what's the level of communication with g. i again know about this

you from ericsson

we're working on our side on other things like also trying to a specter suppression but

but before own i mean another the curse attraction

for moments there

everybody's quite

there is this your speech deadline so

like good but i think that keep saying people are sort of scrambling for your speech deadline that'll

that'll be done in a week

already a week

anybody in the script oop doing anything speech or

and the good thing is that there's this sort of deadline

so if only for the experiments on or a certificate

especially the sensation it's

where is here estates this here

board

but i'm meeting digits maybe is yes

so i mean i think that you could certainly start looking at the issue

i'm going to be out next week but i could

but i could tried to look into like this c. b. s. over the web that

and things so maybe i can figure out how to do that easily and then pass the information on everybody so that it's you know is easy to do as possible and

as possible and people don't want to interfere with their regular work and maybe that would be good

and i think we could use it for other things around here too so

awhile so maybe i can ask you some questions so

so i'll be away tomorrow and monday but i'll be back on tuesday wednesday

today the other thing actually is this talk this way for me and

made a good audio demonstration because when you play that clip theses the really obvious difference is that you can hear two voices and in the second one and down here maybe we could just like talking

some good river

pretty river but i mean you can't when you play back in the room with a you know a big room nobody can hear that difference really they hear that it's lower

really they hear that it's lower aptitude to hear the second voice

actually that makes for a perfectly good demo because it's real obvious

thing that you hear two voices but not reverberations

because your visual abilities as a human being are so good you can pick out you know you

out you know you look at the good when you look at the crew the screwed up on and you can see the features in it that trying to i noticed that in the pictures i think you know i

right my initial thought was this is not too bad

and then you look and the other one and they don't practically five

say this really sort of quite a bit the main

effect since you're getting all this indirect energy than a lot of it does have reduced high frequencies but

but the thing is the temple courses of things really are changed in and we want to show that in some obvious way reason

some obvious way reason i put the way forms in there was because they do look quite different

after they're put in there i didn't really look at them anymore just

are different so want something that has a more interesting explanation for why the different

and so maybe we can just substitute one of these way farms and

way farms and and do some kind of zoom in on this doctor come on an interesting area

the other thing we had in there that i didn't like was that the most obvious characteristic of the difference when they listen to it is that there's a second voice and

and the the cuts that we have there actually don't correspond to the full away form it's just the

reason behind it but it's it's the first six seconds or something of it and it's

of it and it's in the seven thirty second or something where the second voice comes and so we would like

since it's most obvious thing when you listen to it

i brought some figures here whether i

figures here whether i that we started to work on specter subtraction

the preliminary results where very bad so

so the things that we did it just do i'd stick inspection before process you can think that

and so we started to look at that things like this

and they put the disk phone to china's jenna zero

jenna zero it's closing the microphone just

microphone just this the microphone

this is all part of this easier early energy so they just to

early energy they just to see hero when we don't q. of correction

there's just some filtering would that be

be done something attempting

it's channel one is so she is you're researching

so she is you're researching

them when we mean meaner my education looks like the second figure

good the pockets

and then the third figure is what happens when we but i mean not isolation and the variants on my mission

but you can carry see that on the speech portion some the two channeled come becomes very close but

this is still the parents something is

this is still being a plot it's easier

easier can i ask just says see hero

unless it's the parents so it

i mean it's normal the that deviation so

no i understand that but i mean it you get an estimate of the standard deviation

no i understand what it is but i mean what is it

i mean because everything if you have a system based tango scenes everything is based on means in variance is

in from outside rather than artificial light so food a lot

so food a lot if more was coming in from outside than to be the bigger effect of the of the change in so

so every mean every all of the parameters that you have especially the variance is are going to be affected by the overall variance

so would the major effect is that you're going to get is five normalized in the means

that's the first order but the saying but then the second but it may help first order effect and it may help

saying but then the second orders is a variance is effect and it may help to do the variance

saying but then the second orders is a variance is effect and it may help to do the variance

because again if you try and distinguish between he and n. b. it just

or something or the variation in it was larger and the bees and this'll be give you some bias so

edition and that's what we've already observed

but after you do this what's the key sections that and you think either

but after you do this after you do the variance normalization that and you think either

i don't know it seems like this would be a lot easier than this signal to work with so but i know see that's

to work with so but i know see that's what i prefer to look at the second figure then the third one

but because you could issue where speech is

but for the purposes but the brother me that on the speech portion jenna zero each other ones are more different then when you use virus from my addition our ten as you in general and become closer

but for the purposes of finding this beach but you

you're more interesting the difference between the speech and then on speech right

for i think that wretched shows that the army too is that the voice acute sector should use after you was should be different departments of that has to be used for speech recognition

so you want to reduce this effect so

but that's not pretty

of farming person it's bets are retire after my mission

but there's just have the voice activities section in

a distraction after the various normalization or that

or that i before various on my vision so it's a good thing because

is it applied so it's a good thing because i we're sick easy detection on base it could be worse

is it applied all the way back here

it's a died

that's why it doesn't work for channel one

so we could perhaps do just mean or my addition before he

sort of top level question which

level question which is if most of what deogee guy folklore working with is trying to integrate this other spectra subtraction where we weren't about it

the construction

it's just whether it's another

that trying to use the ericsson and you're trying

ericsson and you're trying to do something else

and also to understand what happens because

but when we do spectra subtraction actually i think the dishes the it two last figures

speech is more what and than before whether

but if you compare to fess figure this one

get used not the same but if you look at the numbers if you see that the difference between b. c. zero the speech and seaworld in those portions voucher

so upright variance in my addition and they see complexities school

and what they did the itchy eyes just they don't choose online on my vision for the moment inspect inspection i think

i think as soon as they were incredible mine online edition

so we're working on the same thing but i think

actually it's interesting to work on things one way or the other but i'm

way or the other but i'm just wondering if a list of things that there are to do the same things

do the same things that we won't do because we've got two groups doing the same thing

they're also could be i mean i can maybe see reasons for both working on it too is

on it too is you know if you work on something else and you're waiting for them to give you special subtraction i mean

i mean it's hard to know whether the effects that you get from the other experiments you do carry over one she's then bring in their spectrum subtraction module

mean we still we have a latency reduction plan which is clearly like to be

and then what their issues of having second stream or something

there was this business that you know we could use up the full forty eight hundred bits and

do you remember when the next meeting is supposed to be the next it's saying

the other thing is that you saw that mail about the v. a. d. the eighties performing quite differently that

this there was this experiment of what if you just take the baseline

says as teachers just smoke

and it looks like the french eighties is actually better improve the baseline

improve the baseline

if they use the small g. e. d.

because it doesn't work at all

i don't know which one it's speculative

which one it's speculative did this experiment

and the it's something that something worse but they it's

but they it's i think you're talking about the other means that use the the riff surrounds features

and on that one the frenchmen i suppose better

and on that one the frenchmen

ms enough better that too but count for a fair amount of the difference between the performance actually

and perhaps we can usually improve if you put like mean no my addition before he can

can mention

hinckley back in town the week after next back

interesting

no use of pitch

eleven that bitch but to

that bitch but to look at find and i resolution spectrum

but don't necessarily want to find the picture and sound it

the other thing that when music you and me likud just at the end of the there's no way you can tell if it's always tenants like if there was some

it's easy in king speech because like sound i'm although frequency and

there is the first formal and just archer

i or looking across time

i think you some but the voice though right

enough position speech

i thought that you were he was talking about

know and finish who's going to sing talking about

it they would be otherwise stream it to the end of it opened the second could be interesting to be in that's something

larry so it could be an idea we are

we are thinking about just taking the spectrum

you from that you asked me or you asked

and that is another way of getting rid of part of the noise so

so that's something that is sort of finer

things a little more information introspective subtraction

and he had some i he did that serving combination ross process kind of

process kind of crosses taken care of loose smells and he was and

and that some decent results doing that so that's another

so that's another way

always accuse we've actually

didn't ahead dude send around that message q.

so that's voice activities sectors opposed to voicing detector so we're talking about

so we're talking about something little different i'm

i i'm i missed it

i what you could do maybe is i missed it
