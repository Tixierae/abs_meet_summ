because it's that's kind of from here on these are kind of from
you so even just reported she's really happy about these keep be peace being in the same order indian somehow has
to another generation comes it's on
i was looking at it doesn't
in instances connect to each other and all that sort of so
or any of these other ones of multiple models
because they can strain each other i mean it's
here's a really hard problem we have insulted that
do it to me you have to keep track with a person but
so i think in fact that's the other thing is this is
we've been quite a bit of that we've been doing into this is clearly part of that high
and another draft none of that is so around but
and another draft none
i can understand that looked people different mondays package them up and then
i mean i only was meeting it happens to be a too but i think that's
one two three surveys to thirty
i was actually going to work on it for tomorrow like this weekend eat i would sort of get it again notion of what would you guys
but that's part of the formal as it's got to be
constructions now would make sense can you run around the indefinite putting on idea past scary
and then you fix the car with a wrench

but we can ask did you get to read offline edwards
which they call dynamic
new and so it could be that way and another and tourist entity gets mentioned you b.
you know it's because the other day it just in that direction is with a question about concerning it
if we wanted to have that function in the title could die knock marginal smart come i have the written consent if young
this is highly relevant to someone ceases
so the point is it's very likely that robert ceases just going to be along these lines and
and the local rules are if you were a thesis you'll get to decide how it's done
so if you know if this is the this becomes part of your thesis you say hey we're going to do it this way that's the way it's been
exactly come and take all the they had the because it sensors and anyway do you
right i mean i so there won some version
if you have time after this whole the on know that'd be
and will you want and so that the idea is on monday it too with
is what we're doing in the compliment is robert to i'll send you i find the
is how we talk about stems back first man expect specifications and that

or my police and your beliefs or any of these other
actually i anyway that's kind of countries around which one is too
haven't it might even be interesting to and to say that i should be forced to sort of pose some of the ideas that if you're floating in my head out of the out of the top pet
so we you had you'd done one draft
that's normal i it's good and read it if i this is i'm shocked
it's good and read it i this is i'm shocked this the first time
but second that would be great it's
it's it's a you're going to need it anyway
and i would like to discuss it then you know the good
cycle through this but that the draft of the proposal once constructions just going to tell us a lot about what we think needs to be done by can stroll
meeting time for the summer we really haven't found one we
really haven't found one we did thursdays one for awhile
it's a wizard saying at the wednesday noon that's with you would
know see if i can afford it like this so we're married fixed the car

you know in the long run we need to solve both of those and my suggestion
and my suggestion is that we start digging in them both the way we think you know hopefully
is that people to manage to do this so there probably
new b. we're actually we initial all you know isn't to be initialized thee state
people different airspace in this matter i'm neutral
i'm neutral
just like mark out of right that's a subsidy that's
it's good for you mark out of it that's a subsidy that's what picks up students in or for
we've talked a little bit about that too which i the sam's speck
which i it's hard for me to figure out that's our general linguistic issues how they map onto this particular one but

@reject@ three
always on up the paper
this is not it's not bad for the project if keeps talking to george
my suggestion is we just
voices which i already told far compete but we aren't going to use because they're really bad
i so there some version
so there was like you know maybe in my head the goal to have like an intermediate version like everything i know and
willing to change one now all you know it's a good minimal change
willing to change one now all based all a good minimal change

i have you reservations
what thing is this the whereas construction is that
right and if we is the foremost him is good then we should be able to have you know sort of martyr skill think that by the
the question of whether one
the question is the fifties so that just don't want to know
because it's like the other thing is whether you have a user model that has you know no current plan plans that have been discussed
you know you weren't but that's it was just a section
it's but that's if that's with you would section
maybe i do need a palm pilot actually we did scrap on monday time just because oscar equipment come monday so there's nothing

is he tested me again
that's how i think of our continuing interactions
i should try to finish it but
we've been doing quite a bit that high
quite a bit that there are many jobs for
there are many jobs for you rubber
that seems always land in your category you rubber conclusion he's going to need this
this the first time i've seen a thesis proposal change

and fate has four out he to rewrite the german concepts syntax to present the roads
that's looks
like i solved it the problem of you were talking about how do you
whether that's what i was in i was i was only in terms of entertainment does this
of that object when e. this is mentioned thee probability of the second entering change
of that object change changes
that force that scored anyway
with that you know try and do some of the question constructions now can

member no that that was one of the advantages of documents right is
so you could just as tag electrical instruction with the fact that it's a you know thirty percent increase in probabilities entry
we've been quite a bit of that we've been doing into this is clearly part of that high
know you weren't there on purpose
i can understand that looked people different mondays package them up and then
i would suggest that we need to talk
of the weekend because kate has a photography show that's fine so when my
kate has a photography show that's fine so when my continue our email saying that might be fine too

and she would like to apply the on taught that this being crafted that you know
that's not the one i sent you the last anywhere from
it's terrible you the last anywhere from m. d. out of the european trumpets
and one of the reasons i wanted the those ideas west
i mean because they the third would know what nodes like needed to be activated so you just keep track
either that's what i was looking for
good luck so that it so it did i mean to this is the point we got to cycle through this but
so you fundamentals and then you

what the sifting say on the back me yea
testing what the sifting say on the back
what the sifting say on the back
activated and you're able to conclude on it coming spending activation
to conclude on it coming spending activation
room so you know i mean
based all the old like grass just he's

exactly right there g. i. s. crafted a couple of five phone type forces that are really and
that we can still dig agree on the gender if we want
to do this so there probably are some the flea clean rules they're just not
turned out but in terms of cook the colonel imitation right
this is especially the base inadequate ones of the spreading activation is
who happened to be around those people who might not be around so much

i can graduate or you graduate institute trial oregon
that seems always land in your category you're lucky conclusion he's going to need this right so
you're lucky right so that's part of why we want the formal and this is because
made it much easier to make these decisions right i
right i that's canada they are positions
actually i problem with that word too but anyway but so that's but it too

thereby increasing the number of funding smart consistence in this house from one of my that took two three
there's the other disorder or more of the times or something
there's the other there's that as the times or something
we want to get down so what are kind to meet monday and
sort you said you're busy with until the weekend right
sort of the weekend because right

we think you know hopefully turns out to be consistent
and sometimes it's actually easier to heart our problems in one
the other thing is this is think of heartburn is a very good time to start trying to make explicit where construe comes in and
we comes in and you know work where the construction per se ands and where construe comes into this is clearly
usually he can't is it's a coincidence that you can't do couldn't do it today year
andy usually yes no rear constraints so

go shopping afternoon into the powder tower
talking about shopping and then
i mean if you're ask for much of the train ride and some of them round the when you're it's costs and then so many times it's sixty daughters and then you say how much is i would like to is it the whatever something competed different and i go to your part trace
can only do three at one about because they
those meeting recorder meeting recording on making
what are we maybe you and i should meet sort of more less first thing monday morning and work on see if they're consistent yes that's

so on right request but you know almost certainly can you pass the salt is a construction worth noting that there is this
right which is that is which one is right there'll be other can in the short run it's more important to know how we would treat technically what we do if we decided hey and what we do we decided be than it is to decide air beaver right now
which is that is which one is right to decide air beaver right
and feed those for the dial up history and checked dynamic
for each call and to t. we look at top check whether any of these were mentioned and then activate the corresponding no it's on the discourse

so you could you could convert universe the whole thing so use you tag that information on to the less conscience you
you had to recognize it anyway
that's the argument the other direction
and this is because they it is going to have implicit in it was i in the room
in it i in the room

for my so you don't have to they're too much in the shit sensors and be
and be job out the bad base once to take inputs a base and that's in innocent job on the station
since so but
right rules they're just not context retreat and

it worked again maybe it before they
obvious from world knowledge that
it's like this perfect can you also write it up
the basic idea is that

one of the things i would like to do over the next it month of make take more is just understand to what extent we can not only figure out the construction for them for multiple world
then there is the really clever way that was suggested by keith and
maybe i do need a palm pilot on monday time just because oscar equipment
that's the eighteen so streamline hearing

i i agree with you that it's a disaster to try to make separate construction for every pragmatic reading although
right reading although there are some that will need to be there
and a little bit into august
is in some ways it's not as good but this

and checked dynamic to be
tell you the truth i'd dread i'd i you know i have no fixed
but i mean those are usually than holidays anyway
i have not really approach a lot of the data but i mean

i mean this function so
know i mean i could think i can think of arguments in either direction and that's how you want to
early at least the next week there's a lot of we want to get down so what
the next week there's a lot of we want to get down so what are kind to meet monday

there's a few of us around a lot of thesis going
let's talk about the fire the twenty nine
they said he's going to take vision pieces by then right so he's got us that he's got need meeting in germany was the safest advisor
they said he's going to take vision pieces by then need meeting in germany was the safest advisor

go be take off by one here
but anyway send me the note and then i'll
it is we have the choice between the usual festival voices which i already

but mine is correct
your mikey number so seven at the back
but you're you i've invested you again and say

the guy
in august and she's also got a new student working on this and we should get in touch with them again you know all and
actually i problem with that word too but anyway but so that's but it too

she spoke german the roads
ho so sometime next week
now it turns out that effort leads us into some big hole that's why

so it'll say it's nonsense with gosh
i mean it can be changed the voice that the thing because right now the voice
because right now the voice sounds like a murder

against better not shouldn't of work but they worked
meeting regular meeting time for the summer we
i was actually going to work on it for tomorrow like this weekend eat you know i would sort of get it again notion of what would you guys in store for me

i'm surprised i didn't know about it since
tell you the truth i'd dread i'd would like to avoid more than one yes i mean per day i mean i have no fixed
i'd like to have than on mondays package

we like why didn't we know only invited speakers and
the consequently done i get to decide and it's roberts job
i'll just pick a piece the problem and then this push the hard into the censor unsafe drivers i've always

see that you know before you start in the sense i also
in the sense i also had a email correspondence with death unequal or i said yes she would love to work with us on the you know using these structured please nets and
we've talked a little bit about the questions we didn't we never did forgot how we're going to do emphasis and the sam's speck

which is mental spaces and and the war
maybe it'll be a similar thing no i know i think that is going to be sort of the key to this to the big project of the summer it's up to the getting instructions right
i i actually do is the earliest i can meet on monday

thought but the other part of it is the way they connected to these published it relational models so
they seem to be tons of people around
the only disadvantage is that it may interfere with other

anyway so with a little luck
so let's have a physical anyway
so what was the date there monday or

examples that are one way or the other we know for that we have to be able to do both i
recorder meeting recording on making
it's a plane so there's nothing impeding monday anymore either

does it seem like they just managed to dalai history with a thread that you know kept track of of the activity of
i think it's also something that people have not done before is sort of abusing and taunted cheese for these kinds of the inferences is on
with anything relevant to the current something has been has crept up and the topic is three already or not

about shopping and then you say you know what's the cost or something that know
one could imagine but
to tell you the truth of what i've been looking at has not been the data so far has sort of set let's see if a little bit more

so when you admit have admission seen it change something is only for that particular relational right is for
relational right is for that particular object i did that i did a simple
i did a simple idea is it's only for them occurrence torso entity of instance interest

she said i mean you so we just moved
she said i mean you can't make one o'clock no he can't
so let's say thursday once

you want to meet again here it's the speech and meeting
it's the speech and meeting still it on tuesday actually we
ones since we have this idea about the indefinite pronouns thing and all that you know i can try and run with that you

anyway i so let's for the moment call it that it we think of something better and
it's got to be how things like that get mark
do you have data like that you have preliminary data because i know you know we've

that's some sort of conversion program yea
that's a language generation produces not that just the surface thing that this had into a texas speech but so if a string with a syntax tree that's fit into a concept of speech

and therefore be
languages are written is that scheme

i even without getting into even though the scheme that is really documented and
teaneck herman

i if you not used to such a programming schemes to be completing comprehensible
sometimes like the thought that my name's functions and

so it's you know on a generation thing
yes she's really going to do that and we should be able to get president as so

this program since
it worked again maybe it before they hired intuition too

you know neutral party voices so but
i headlines will make a presentation of through it

i can graduate or you graduate institute trial oregon
turns out this the longstanding links these guys in speech group

in fact this guy going to join appointment
of the data but i mean like these be the question ones since we have this

and we never find out why
of so it should be feasible to set them up in such a way that if you've got the past tense in the present tense in each of those as a separate belief structure that they do their inferences it was just a couple things that are appropriate

it's just like why by the generation my the presentation is not working
and so isn't the first paragraph doesn't seem to have any links to the second paragraph

his school at works so
no i but i think what robertson right that to determine that you may want to go through is the stars and in turn true or something discourse enter

the people as a brick and i decided not to touch it ever again that
what thing is this where the whereas construction is where is that

it starting in august and she's
that's for you and doing online merging with my control

sort of put the formal as him look like in where swanson forcibly also what that would translate into in terms of belief that and in the story
but for next week this is a bit

and when you have a certain construction that imply certain coupling is another coupling she'll be teams within
so let's think of the name or for whatever of the is any media structure is how we talk

various issues how calm up floral now and gets to quote count as a noun phrase you know an
i just talked to ami is it's a coincidence

phrase you know an argument of a higher construction but bearer singular stand doesn't get to act that way right
here's my plan for today here's my plan in the morning i want to

think that by the waist is keep cute i curse george to be talking with you but not the formal
with you but not the formal isn't yet

but no individual member no that that
right so i certainly more realistic i mean

i have a busy weekend about after that separately about
about after that gung

we have insulted that's just fine
what they of the just that this sentinel selection is better

i think it is but can be it's the birth thinking of an except on a bar tourism thing domain that involves decent men so space shift or setting up
thing do i get to see a uniform and this before

me how to get there right assume these up to our nose that we can observe in the face that's so be
sir forgot about the camping thing so

and it's just too fall it's
if we encounter phrase such as where sex should that said this to too and it's so true and the base

true and the base that figures out which under the current situation and it's more likely
or should it just activate this have this beef off and the

someone mentions up you know and
someone mentions it missions sees that activates an interest chemo which sticks around for a little while in your reprimand them representation of what's being talked about and then and

right realistic i mean psychologically now's
so at the time you mentioned it

the way in the black base that you could think about it this way that at the time and missions see was mentioned you could increase the probability that someone wanted to answer
that someone

know as good but this in place we got we don't have a connection
know i mean we don't have a connection sympathize

up sell but my is what will probably happen here's a to sign is that there are certain constructions which for our purposes do change the probabilities of you could decisions and various other kinds
no i but i think what robertson you get is that i just that observed and heard it's that's the noted for in turn true or something discourse enter

of that the standard waited that there's these context work is sort of stacked like or whatever but that sort of the
what's the argument for putting in the construction of the just that

unfortunately in a fancy one with multiple worlds you could have you could keep track of what someone was is saying about this and that you know i want to go
here's my plan that you know i want to go in the morning i want to

imagine but not yet
but i do think that he'll turn out that it's going to be ten pretty much on whether there's been a dove right

it's not more like you that you want to enter anything but as of fact
drivers i've always been in favor of consensus decision so we'll

and i think he's right is you don't want to try to build to the construction itself all of a sudden hymns you know all the work
it's just another sort of construction side this hard to get a beep us when inferences we can draw from this christmas tree

it was to mexico construction itself all out of context they won't do it to me you
just he's just like mark out of right that's a subsidy that's

always me when it's someone's pieces no
there's a few of us no it's not no we got a like we got a lot of thesis going

right yes another decision they're just proposals
that's the point is constraints

then you know the good your guys's input to make
your guys's input to make it sort of bomb proof

those people know you i people in this group connecting with
those people who happened to be around those people who might

i don't care i
can only do three at one thirty with about because they

@reject@ but i that's me too i'm i'm here
i it's lit one sort of thing is this room is taking i up to three thirty you're pretty much every day by the connection

by the connection so we
so we have something except for this week we something so that's why was

next week we're meeting tuesday i could
that's right mean we usually need tuesday for make with at too

there should be relatively flexible but i mean
there's just sort of two to four of us right like the multiple meanings

two to four of us right the multiple meanings
and you know of course that's and i are just sort of always talking anyway and sometimes we do it in that room so you know

all of the proposed times sound fine with me monday
earlier in the week what do i mean what we're saying is that

right like i mean you know maybe not maybe put this part of what we can do monday if we won in store for me
like you know maybe not maybe in store for me

of more less first thing monday morning and yes
we had to we had an idea for this which seemed like it would probably work great

if you have that might be fine too know
if you have time after this whole know

you want and so that's for you so that the idea is on monday it too with c. in intermediates version of the former listen for the construction and doing
so that's for you for the construction and doing online merging

you are told to do this
and i the two the way you would do with someone picks the car with a wrench

until middle palm pilot

see that matches the seat up there

on these are kind of from one

know that the papers correctly the paper is correct

correctly the paper look at the paper is correct

i didn't did i was saying the microphone up the paper

is he tested always on

spoiled again

it keeps going up he's talking with george right now

@reject@ rubble with george right now he is he going to get a ripple away from that

@reject@ a ripple away from

rubble blaine not is my

this is going to be the five of us he was very affirmative

is going to be the five of us he was very affirmative and this missing he will be here for but

but you know that was before he knew but the perfect or probably

i have had and foremost talks with most of you so even just

somehow has bay job decorations for my so you don't have

he buys using the except on star she processor to convert the somehow that's output by the time up is and to be you base input

try like you know in @reject@

pretty rare @reject@

think it should demand things from him

i think it should demand things

georgia so much right

i think it's a good idea then this last

and pretty much in on the top of my list i would have asked keith how to be wary sacks hand parsons standing

but let's skip that

like there's good news from to another generation

the trees for

they can all trees for the for the jet for the synthesizer i read and so i just need

read and so i just need to duty read a new set of tree combining rules but

but i think those are be pretty similar to the old ones

you were going to send me a note about higher reading

i didn't understand but he understood

i know what he's talking about

hiring somebody

no this concept of speech much has so there was somehow if you got the fundraising tactic structure talked about this coolants

is that the germans in english take it into english

if it's that we give her a couple dollars per week then of that

is that scheme thing you said me

she doesn't programming that's this type

she doesn't programming team i hope

my is i asked for comment it's version of that file forget

forget that's then it's doable even without

me the note and then i'll check with morgan on the money i

on the money i don't in any problem that we have an

that we have an ass

which one the we have to change the voice

one the little smarter marcus

the little smarter marcus sounds like a murder

but i will not give them to you unless you come into my lair

since so but

you know neutral party voices

exactly right there g. i. s. crafted a

was male or female

it's the greyhound bus

unfortunately probably males been more research on so or stand for original german institution

unfortunately probably males been more research on so or because i can't stand for original german institution

i can graduate or you graduate institute trial oregon

expensive for my time anyway

and it's probably also interesting for all of you to doing that as a self twenty minutes ago david and i for accidents manage to get it's like come system running on the dixie linux machines but b. c. n. t. machines

that's i was just by accident

that's for accident

for i suggest to try something that was pretty kind of

somebody you get used to as a programmer and his school which

i was going to ask you where something is

i was looking at it doesn't follow logically it

each paragraph is good though i

was written by committee

but because the meeting looks like it's going to be good

i didn't know that until robert on like @reject@ i

on like @reject@ i read i ran across it and i don't even

on like @reject@ i read i ran across it and i don't even know where you know some just

know where you know some just some weird place

we like why didn't they can't tell me know about it since we know only invited speakers and right

you know all and figure out a way to for you you do get connected with their group

and it looks to me like we're now at a good point to do something celebrating something really hard

so working and things that are easy

so there's a lot of problems that the linguists know about mental spaces and the cognitive linguist know about but then there's this problem

but then there's this problem the believe that people have only done a moderately good job of dealing with pepperell police that's which

they in correctly called dynamic police that so

police that so there's a term dynamic place that doesn't mean that it means

it means time slices

and so many years those people use them

the story is that if you have these problems relational models they're set up in principle so that you can make new instances in instances

but that's as far as i can tell is putting it was too real hard problems one is

one is the linguistic part of what are coupling and when

she'll be teams within the past and the present or any other

things and then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the police network

yes it's gone let's say one in you know different answers or my

strain each other i mean it's got huge ricky huge range of possible choices

they would take a really long time to explain now but i'm about to write

now but i'm about to write it up this evening

i saw that at the same time has how do we keep educators from floating to the left of determine or and how do we keep all of that from floating outside the noun phrase to get something like i've thought kicked dog

once so maybe it'll be a similar thing no i know i

but the phenomena

a strong there was just thing that nancy to a in a weak moment this morning

i started in a friendly moments

anyway that we're going to try to get a the first cut at the formulas formal by the end of next week

right probably skipping a mental spaces part

just trying to write up essentially what you guys have worked out so that everybody has something to look at we've talked

no to look at we've talked about it but only the innermost inner group currently knows

and not even all knows

there's the group as a whole noah's but no individual

right is that it actually transfers from had

indication presentations anyway so

funny i never but no with them but we end of next week

i never actually got i said beginning but the two of us will probably talk to before that i mean of next week

actually got i said beginning but the two of us will probably talk to before that

i have a busy weekend about after that anyway let's talk separately about

you know just where my symptoms

and we sort of try and work out what the state of the art is right now right it's it

is right now right it's too expensive we haven't let's ride it

and the extent we don't let's find out

i think it is but i interrupted before he's got to tell us what happened with where is the water tower or setting up

what was supposed to happen i've sort of been actually

to happen i've sort of been actually caught up in some other ones so

ones so you know i don't have a write up of we're having elaborated on the idea is that we are you talking about which were i think

are you talking about which were i think we already came to become just and that we have to alternate if paths that week to a tentative ways of for presenting it

the question of whether the people me is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic one of them was or comes

or pragmatic or comes was off

i think it has to be the second case

so do you is there where we're talking about here

the question is whether the construction is semantic or like ambiguous between asking for location and asking for past so you might be and asking for directions

the question is whether the construction is semantic or like ambiguous between asking for location and asking for past so you might be and asking for directions

or what or whether the construction semantic lee is clearly only asking for location but have

asking for location but pragmatically that's construed as meaning tell me how to get there

face that's so be so either tool falls and

i like off and the base it figures out whether that this actually no means

so that's a separate issue so

or have every construction list all the possible pragmatic implications of the same on right there's some that you can't do that either but you know

so right this one is maybe in the gray area it what

the gray area it what is it like that or is it just sort of obvious from world knowledge that no one you wouldn't want another location without wanting to know how to get there

in some cases it's quite the fifties so that

the question is is this conventional or conversational inspector exactly

inspector exactly

i the more important thing at this stage is that we should be able to know how we would handle it needs

there'll be other can examples that are one way or the other now we know for

i in the short run what's which you clear to run what the two alternatives would be

and then they read another idea floating around which we wanted through or get your input on then

your input on then that concerns the

the thing is we would have repressed that would back to work on it and that's you reno

and that's you reno korea rich from you was going to be visiting us the week before august and a

back to the old john observation that if you have a dial up history and it said the word admission fee was it mentions it's more likely that the person she wants to enter that just took a picture

know what could you imagine to you know have a list for each construction of things that country look up in the discourse histories

that's the really stupid way

then there is the but the way the time to testing that is

that is you get x. which is whatever the cost of

taught edgy look at us that castles have opening hours that they have

that they have admissions jeeze they

jeeze they have whatever and then

and then this is we go via a thesaurus

and look cop certain degree stick surface structures that are related to these concepts and feed

but the key suggested that are much cleaner way would be is near to keep track of the discourse in such a way that you if you know that something like that has been mentioned before this just continues to add up you know and

about and then when someone asked where's x. you've already got that enter scheme activated and you're able kind of a pining

that enter scheme activated and you're able kind of a pining

now's clay

so you just keep track of how long it's been since something's been mentioned in automatically loaded and

it was hard to be higher in context that they

in context that they the conditional probability that someone

@reject@ relevant gosh now my is that it's not a question of time but he is a question of whether another intervening object has been mentioned

relevant gosh object has been mentioned

i mean you look at dial this is of course

this is of course the other thing we had we do is we have the data coming which

right probably will blow all our theories

right skipping that

but that sort of the most recent thing

for today here's my plan for tomorrow right in the

for tomorrow hypothetical right in the morning i'm planning to go shopping afternoon

so when you but as of fact complete compete rejection off entering

you know it's because the other day it just so has the current object being mentioned in with a question about concerning it

i but i think what robertson right discourse enter

so if the issue is if saddam just because this construction been matched you say does this actually have any implications for our decisions then there's another piece of code that presumably does that competition

so sort of for retaining in a way rather than back

in a way rather than back

but robert saying is

or changing of the probably the cheese

what they the argument is that you're going to have be if you selection is better

if you recognize the word

you'd recognize toward which means you have alexis construction for it so you could just

but i but i'm not interested in the opening times disorder

it's just a sidetracked but

you've noticed that that's i'm keeping overtime so then

right they are positions they're just proposals

right they are positions they're just proposals

problem with that word too but but it because i you had to do with my thesis the consequently done i

we decision so we'll that's underway

but the proof that's what

we to be doing it we need some and we need to make some dates

andy and he'll meeting moved win state so

moved win state sense of you know you weren't it was just a

there's the off this week i was thought was thing it was

there's the off this week i was thought was thing it was

i thought was just this week that we are changing

i thought was just this week that we are changing

and how do we feel about doing it once it's because it seems to

it's because it seems to me that this is sort of a time where when we have things to discuss with other people there

thirty with that be horrible

and told me that i it costs this room it's again taking at two thirty five morning

and told me that i it's again taking at two thirty five morning

i can't so you're proposing we meet tuesday

it's a plane impeding monday anymore either

although i thought you wanted to go camping on monday or take off mondays unless you go camping

usually sometimes it works out that way

thing so that's any have problems or

i suggested monday if that's a problem for me

if that's a problem for me that i shouldn't suggest

sounds great i'm blissfully agreeing to things and realizing that i actually do have scheduled on monday

sounds great scheduled on monday

so that's the eighteen so streamline hearing

what are we maybe you and i should meet sort and then i would talk to you and figure everything you know that you know see if they're consistent

work on that's fine with me

i'm i my aunt's you said you're busy

so won't be lack of pull say my former presentation of my proposal to be

proposal to be more like ports finalize that wasn't

because then you'll find out more of what we're making into

it's like this is what we're doing in the compliment to you also write it up

is robert i'll send you i find the i write to just

i everything you might been files to just

someday we also have to we should probably talk about the other side of the where is x. construction which is the issue

which is the issue of how do you stimulate questions what i

what i suspect look like for a question

because it's a little different we had to we had an idea i know that we

it's a little different we had to we had an idea i know that we

i i suspect may need we maybe need to rename the

based all the old like

and we need to find part of what was missing

part of what was missing were markings of all sorts that weren't in there including

in there including the questions we

data because i know you know we've been using this one easy sentence

i and i'm you guys have a maybe you're the one you've been looking at the rest of it be

i the rest of it be unusual for me if we

i to tell you the truth of what i've been looking at has not been the data so far the rest of it be unusual for me if we want to have a little bit more

constructions out of the way first

and i have not gotten away yet surprise so

if i can afford it like this so we're married fixed the car with a wrench

and then you hand it back to your hip campus and find

the w. h. and then come up with that somewhere that someone was

the w. h. question has this sort of extra thing which has and when you're done tell me who feels that slaughter way you know so someone was

and you know this is sort of a way to do it the idea

way to do it the idea sort of saying that you could read from the simulation point of view or whatever you could read w. h. construction similarly to and indefinite pronouns like someone or like the cars

like someone or like the cars in because

in because in @reject@
