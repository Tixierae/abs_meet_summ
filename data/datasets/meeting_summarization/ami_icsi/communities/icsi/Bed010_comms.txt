yes the guys and the lady and i like magic versus the dumps out when he wants to know watch to tell the person to a very an x. m. l. to recover
we can even make instead of an intern internal demo when i show you
and it's not a so forth and so on so
but for the limited amount of we have for this particular exercise i think we just it
it makes it
i just wanted to it's like mentioned as an issue you know last meeting i wasn't here because i went to a
going on at the end of the two overnight within
he exactly so there's an approximate this'll
this isn't a lot of behavioral things on this it was the first north isn't much with that large scale environmental justice
them is starting to do science right and
right and so these issues about reference in special reference discourse reference all this sort of dykes this which is part of what you were talking about
so all of this is coming up essentially starting now
but we are can ignore this because we're not only
because we're not only going to play is not only to lay out this thing that actually build some of

and really with the par sing we're going to worry about par saying the general case
and then that's going to go away pretty soon divorce which we right
i do i speak into it and you hear talk
but tingle you know if it's probably for university
i and might be sincerity is kind of number of ways of doing it but the german might be more like you brew in that respect
the solution they proposed was that it was stitches in texas actors
hi and preference object and i know from my point of view your choice left up the chair
not in direct that you actually
right if you have ever had this
so and so this is another thing where we're going to you know to get involved and makes relatively early i think make some decisions on is there non apology a. p. i. that there's
that there's a certain standard way of getting things month allergies and we
it does or the smart come project or one of the projects that the email have something that we can just pull out for that
so they're going to be some things like that which are not science but system

to course which means it's just using a german synthesis montrose for english sentences
the moment were of course definitely focus on the understandings part time
any other reap there's a report sort of stories
we now know i think what the landscape is like
so boston i went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief that copy patience and was or some known problem with them or did someone already salt you know how to do this and and
you know and by the way speaking of data are there
seems to me that will fairly be of relevance to so what we're doing here because you know people are likely
because you know people are likely to give descriptions like you know what's
what if you're interested in that so how

i mean how do they know which in tactic structure to pull out and all that i see so i think it's not worth
structure to pull out and all that for so i think it's not worth going over in the group it's sort of when
he was talking about dyslexic allies
closure so that if we come up with a question of quit we fit this deeper in there or something you know what the hell
just people talking the big room and so people know what's going on when you're ready
looked at the depth of what right
and he's going to leave us an inheritance which is the hopefully a belief that does these things and
but in terms of what are the decisions and like that's something that we all have to work out
and the thing that got marking the worst trouble is he had a very ambitious and he was trying to do and

and then they got a lot done
make our fit and
so the plan for the summer really is too step back from the apply project
actually roughly starting let's say next meeting because speed we have one other thing too tie up besides the trip report but
a bit care of i think if we do it sort of a paper version of all the notes and then the connections between them that should suffice be fine
we just oppositional phrases you know if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike but in
forth and you deal directly with it
and john is point person on you parse or analyze or whatever that is

it's so you just say you know now and goes to you know
this way we worked around that be
right so crush so you when somebody on the streets come comes up to you ask you what a smart comes you can just give a sensible answer
i mean that's the kind of thing
early to it just it's all saddam i have my home page of the mouth went and then

so where's this huge project
but i think we should forgive japanese construction figure outside of the scope for no but
there is study and the differences between english and german unexpected that problem so it's it they
so it's it they actually said the monkey for another car where's
and then they found statistic you very significant differences in english and german so i

so that's retarded nancy
look like what's execution engine look like what
know @reject@ called i it's
mechanisms that turned out inherently not to cover the space

a concept of speeches feeding into this synthesis much we're giving it to what needs to be said and devote some tactic structure
be the system i can show you the system i actually won that
in england right incidents from where i'm standing it would appear that
so this is what this is linguistic facts but

you speak up the tree
and i considered walks through the information so this
so if you ever get to the generation sides of constructing things and there might be something different just there but the moment were
you can't but there seems to be an actual really deep embodied girl difference that this is

no signs in that whatsoever but it's working
that little stamp or the and doped up a tree
i mean did the deep map project which is undergoing some renovation at the moment but
but to do that we're going to need to make some decisions like an apology

but sort of in parallel with that that hope is it in particular you will work on constructions in english and german for this domain they
and to bus track that down the answer seems
aren't going to do it i mean there's no need for that i was supposed to just
mean there's no need for that no it's not i was supposed to just not too it's been two weeks and changing the job is because i would send you to

and so we just push one and do what we need to do
and one of the things we need to do is be it's i think it's relatively tight intently constraint is to finish up this belief that so
and i was going to switch to start talking about that unless their mother other more general questions
it's bus for switching projects is the first of june and

we do in the long run want to do better visualization office
and you're going to be around to get a waste tuesdays and thursdays afternoon ish as usual
for no but definite this interesting to could it cross the border there
you can either do it to point or three points

they can pay if it if we can pay if we
kevin can it don't i
right piece it was just this construction allies or
and so we think we have a shot at that

it's the be the folks generation off spurs descriptions and whatever
i'm the only person in the resurrection north perks
you of it though senate and
there's that and then there's also a set of systems things that come up so

this thing and it was about if engineering
facts but and here's the way the findings go
and use that within reach

that's you know that's sketchy or whatever right
now where we are not committed for our research to do any of those things so
right so we are committed for our funding

so between us all we have them to get them to the demos they need if
right so what we're going to do initially is to design and if you
right that is you know use your best knowledge of the domain too plus size what the dependencies or and

so they at the demo requirements for this fall are sort of taking care of as of later this week or something and
and then so it's probably fifteen months or something until there's another serious demo requirement
maybe note by know it or something like this or should i

you know construction parts or for general constructions and
and if we need a cut down version for something or whatever worry about that later
so in addition to the he there's an approximate this'll

and i got the feeling that weird the only one friend now wherever running system i don't know what the
system i don't know what the guys because the fountain have running because
right that's a separate problem we do in the long i

know make that open to a lot of us and then so
then so that whatever we discuss in terms of par seeing and constructions we saw i put it in there and they put
two things you can reach really quite different things you can't but there

you can just do anything with it but it's an tactic trees it used to that or whether it's construction
that sort of a fish you have an know it
it follows and

we had decided like
he is with looks like we're now in a position that the construction analyzers that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyze that nancy needs for the child language modeling
so it's always been out of face but it now

whatever didn't decide we wanted to
here's the new amazing resell they say you
you get someone with a with the deficit so that they i perfectly normal ability at distance thing so

no it's not changing the job is because
i would send you to plentitude java app that's that sort of a fish
so he was sent it to plenty eccentric people enter you can have ethnocentric

and and so i looked into a special description so we can generate
what's going on at the end of the two overnight within
john is much more pragmatic

so right but right so the economical direction of motion determines the different physically
yes look at this
and so all of these issues now are now starting the crops and

depending on you know like in front of the car could you know like here's a car
here's a car sideways to me in between me and the car something's in front of the car whatever see that
but anyway so you know i mean this is very good talk on those kinds of issues and so and

this video tape is in front of me
i'm d. r. go and i lost a reference object those are
those are two point

here you understand you have it either be ego i know centric
and of course it's only in both cases only one piece of a bigger system it would be
right it would be if that piece we're exactly the same piece it was just this

that's retarded nancy said she's coming and i mean she will be
that's right on these last week we started interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week

we got to the point where we can now speak introduced market system and go all the way through and then say something like real men newer real one i'm smock of course it actually
but yea i noticed people do you see them so

it doesn't know hi
this topic i the

and it you know says i'm going to try to do the greek person goal
and it passes the tree on to the just the generation dorm

i take generate different reason and german once and
because you know like i did and in german is automatically take care of it just a regular for so i

so it might be worth the piece you looking at this
in any case

i still tell and
i still don't i just don't really understand it like i mean we sort of say tell and

you know i still don't exactly understand sort of the information flow in this thing or what the modules are and so on so
is just for closure so that

are and so on so you know like just that such and such module decides that it once to achieve the goal of greeting the user and then magically
the user and then magically it sort of

it's a messy but once
but once you understand it you understand that it's there's

kind of they know not worry about par seeing them are fitting them into smart calm or any of the other anything in any other constraints for the time being it's hard
demo and then that's going to go the divorce which we

right and i don't want you feeling that you have to somehow meet all these other constraints
and even some of the rough of such then there wasn't really working worsen it good dated without the all the shortcuts that they put in for the it works for situation may be ahead

sounds like to before the summer's turn into science mode and i think that's
and i think that's also you're playing as

the parts are in that
follows and so in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right in the formal as him and we actually going to build something

the systems integration group
@reject@

and it was it was fun to some extent but
to some extent but be the outcome that is sort of a scientific interest is that i think both rough into him and

and part of my responsibly is it to use our inter group where so at you know make that open
so i've seen from the church be telling holidays right off that fire station

town and we winter is and i think more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the notes that we needed for the demo left we're thinking of were in there and
in there and they run across one or two more but connections

and so the current state of things is that again starting now would like to actually get a running belief that for this particular sub domain done in the next few weeks
@reject@ right no it's not and that's not affected

it that i can imagine and you take note he to do that
or is there a particular on apology that we're going to standardize on and if so for example is there something that we can use their

not this point and i went through
not this point right and i went through all the packages on @reject@ page and

it may be afraid activities it's a so you
and if the @reject@

probably for university it's going to be real cheap anyway but
but it was fifty thousand dollars aren't going to do it i

and then you can pick up something else that's most away that course into the middle
and maybe there's an easy way for interfacing goes too

that doesn't work it's not a problem we need to suffer now but
i'm but my job is i will give you the inputs terms of the internal structure

pretty as time passed this we get more data from heidelberg can some people actually using it and so
it and so but this is the i'm run but this

i could swear i could try sought sitting on someone's desk at some point but is there
because you know i'm still sort of itching to look at what look at the time and see what people are saying make yourself in the

that you know it's just strange but
we probably would not get those two described because of were trial runs

because i went to a linguistics program on the fact of motion and that was pretty interesting right
and that was pretty interesting and you know i mean

all that so i mean i'm in terms of you know people trying to state locations or you know all that kind of is going to be very relevant so
so i was the talk was about english versus japanese which the japanese doesn't affect us directly except that some of the construction he'd

think about how much is it used in german
be i was in i on a different subject i mean

it may be another thing to keep it from but i think
it may be another thing to keep it from

and german so i
and three point relations is if something has an intrinsic front side like this joe then you're if is behind the chair

play that's a centered already goes to central that frame of reference
and then you have the reference object and the object to be localized

go is it ten minutes technically in that sense it's even just
that sense it's even just mean it's good or

i think this is getting but it's
i think this is getting into i mean sing

the first explain something that i've always wondered about
and i'll do this testing you guys as so

away right
away right i said

i and how much we building and so forth
he is with looks

to come full circle on that is foremost nations task
you used to someone is trying to get the formal as you know put into a shape work and actually

the better just to go through

my suggestion is that robert and john was sort of give us a report on last week's adventures to start

so everybody knows there were these guys from heidelberg right actually from do you ski i part of the german sparkling project who were here for the week

it actually says squeamish i and so i'm smart to course which means

it doesn't know hi so

this topic is i try is it's the thing

the synthesis it's just a question of hopefully just a question of exchanging a couple of five once we have them

and it's not going to be a problem but cos we decided to stick to these so called concept of speech approached i'm

i'm i'm going backwards not so synthesis

not so synthesis is where you sort of make this make these sounds

so i can pronounce things better presumably than just with texas beach

and john doe that are how talks rights x. amount tax

and that right the treated running gram for some sentences now right

and there's a conversion system for different back up something else

and so the knowledge base where the system that generate a statistic tactic structures or is that just generation is you know but like but it was like four and

four and i think it actually these some tactic structures is like

so i just starts i find it very up and just decides to you know @reject@ did you speak

yes it does it takes trees are but i think the part is that of the twelfth possible after insist that the german system can do we've already written that the syntax trees for three or four

yes it does it takes trees are very simple it's like three or four

very simple it's like most of the sentences and one tree

and instead of you know you to like you didn't take used it isn't it the happen or you know and if there's or something like that and make you said it does and

so i'd come and it a little too they take listen generate an x. m. l. three like structure i'm not into that so

hurt not i don't i never been good it does so it's like the b. p.

and so it's like the b. p. goes to and then those things and less and a generic brand

right and because we're sticking to that start traditions as a sponsor doesn't need to be changed so all that offensive and the

and the texas beach version of it switches i should send the reason is it going to be done in october which is much too late for us so

actually won that easter you'll should be able to started on your own if you want to play around with it in the future

right now it's brett so and you need to started up and then make it's twenty changes on seventeen montrose before they actually can stomach it anything

and send in a like a couple of side curries on some dummy sender setup program so that it actually works because it's

because it's designed for this you get thing where you have d. jester recognition running with this sickness even switch central touch screen which we don't have here

and so we're doing it's b. i'm nollis but this one system

but this one system was designed to work with this thing and it was

but it's working now and

now and that's the good news so

i the good news so everything has actually did prove to be that which independent except for the person in that generation

it just a regular for so i

so i that and walking that little

i noticed that that some of the examples they had you know non-english murderers and so on you know

i still don't i just don't really tell and

for soon in the group it's sort of when you get this free and you have the time either robert or china or i can't walk you through it

that's fine and you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together

that it's there's nothing really complicated about

and i remember one thing that came up and the talk last wednesday was this i think you talked

i think you talked about the idea of like he was talking about dyslexic allies true joining grammar is where you sort of for each word you preach

preach electrical item electrical entries says what all the the trees are that it can appear in

and of course that's not that's the opposite of construction that's you know that's

i no know to just get the damn to get the demos they need

they need if it turns out we can also give them lots more than that bike you know tapping in the other things we do that's great but

that bike you know tapping in the other things we do that's great

as it turns out not to be in any the contracts @reject@

as it turns out not to be in any the contracts @reject@

and deliberately

so the reason i'd like you to understand what's going on in this demo system is not because it's important to the research is just for

right or something you know what the hell we're talking about fitting in

so it's just and the same actually but the rest of us

we just need to really understand what's there is

is anything we can give back beyond the minimum requirements

but none of that is a short time fuse

right demo requirement that i mean we don't think about it for fifteen months but it means we can

right but it means we can not think about it for six months

keep it to keep the context open but actually go after the basic issues

and so the idea is there's this other subgroups it's worrying about formalize zine you know take getting a notation but

kind of being it's hard enough to get it samantha lynching technically right and in it and get the constructions in their form and and

so i mean but the point is that like the meetings so far that i've been that have been sort of been geared towards this demo right the

and then sort of shift gears a fairly substantially it's not

what i but i think this is a good idea that i can show it to anyone who's interested we can even make instead

when i show you what i do

the information so this is like a half hour forty five minutes just fine

so crush we could set that up is actually an inch too wide thing just

i mean that's the kind

that's the level at which we can just like invite everybody and say this is a project we've been working on and here's a demo version and like that

dayton how about we do want to have all the box out there where you have to sort of type in x. amount of messages from left and right before

is that it's clear then i think

is starting next thing i think we won too slipping into this mode where

there are a lot of issues what scientology

of issues what scientology look like you know what constructions

you know what constructions look like what's execution

but more focused on an idealized version then just getting them

now before we do that let's get back and help

but it's still i think useful for you to understand a demo version enough so that you can see what it is that it might eventually get retrofit it into or something

and john is already done that looked at the depth of the look it's marked on what right

the parts are in that @reject@

trip they report on these

be done but it was just amazing there to see how unstable the whole thing is and if you just take

is and if you just take b.

the version that is the full version that's on the server it's not work

i do need to do a lot of to make it work and so

it work and so it's

may be ahead of the system called by now

and i know that they tried to here

and they like a lot of the they saw here

and they're more than willing to i'm cooperate by all means

and maybe we can even get some overlap got some synergy out of that

i find someone that know how that is interested in that i'm even think that we could look take constructions and generate from them because

from them because the tree trying to grandma said that tremendous using it but she said nothing but a mathematical form and isn't you can just do anything

so here's where we are in the belief that as far as i understand it

it going back i two weeks ago robert had laid out this belief that missing only the connections

put all the dos town and

more but connections worked

that down the answer seems to be no one has done it the guests perfectly reasonable thing do if that's what you set out to do

there are two aspects to it one of which is you know technical getting decoding

you know technical getting decoding right and making get run and like on the other is the actual

on the other is the actual semantics

what don't you know what are the considerations and what are of the ways in which they relate

so he got he's he doesn't need help from this group on e. technical aspects or he does we'll do that separately but in

i mean it's both you guys understanding where

decide we wanted to look into maybe getting it's the visualization a bit care of i

right i did look into that in terms of you know it's putting the note done down downey

job is not to it that i can

not this point you probably take weeks so to actually go through and do it and i went through

they can pay if it i couldn't find it necessary mix of for eat and it to get we and i just think we

if we can pay if you was paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that

so it don't view free as a absolute constraint

and you can ask kevin mean is that i would go back and look at the ones on us but

and you can ask kevin on us but

it may be afraid activities like i don't know a so you

i have a call i have a copy of that i downloaded so at one point it

so at one point it was free

in boston give you put it

you have an know it and you take on it and chose choice the other connections and then you can pick up

or should i collected all in

what would that change i

this is not a crisis it i mean you do either everybody student should you know do their work get of course it's all in good shape and the and

all in good shape and the most big down on this

that's good that means i have that i can spend this week doing

how do you go about this process of deciding what his connections are know there's

are know there's an issue of how to the different things too and right i mean you just sort right

right i mean you just sort of gas and shifted sort of right they're

sort of they're they're two different things you do want to she design

you do want to she design and the other she'll are

if it's done right and if you have data they and their art techniques for learning the numbers given the structure and they're

and they're even techniques for learning the structure although that takes a lot more data and it's not a

so forth and so on so

that's right but this other problems like mediocre designed was too i think

point but is there a transcript of any of the sort of in actual interactions with people with with the system

sun and of course these would like the german as as english so whatever you guys can

it of course germans that

i mean i sort of found the the audio of some of those and

of those and it kind of sounds like i didn't want to trudge through that you know it's just

but that's said that but we have some data in english and german already so

mean transcribed i've seen that

so while we're still at this sort of top level anything else that we ought to talk about today

you know what's that saying right where you start to go up the hill or something like that you know

or something like that you know meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some reference point all that so i mean i'm

some of the construction he'd what you talked about was you know an english we say things like that you know your bike is parked across the street from

but in japanese that the more conventional eyes tendency is to use sort of a description of where one has crossed the river there's a tree

and you know you can actually say things like there's a tree where one has crossed the river but no one has ever crossed the river or something like that and so the idea is that

and so the idea is that this really you know that's supposed to show that it's really effective and so on but

but the point is that kind of construction is also used in english you know like right where you start to go up the hill or just when you get off the train or something like that tend came or something and so we'll have to

at the moment but this three language protract german english japanese and

and we have i have taken care of that we have speed the japanese generation and and

so we can generate especially description sounded to for me to be and information on object german english and japanese since

since there's a huge show project on special descriptions is differences in especially descriptions

i mean that definitely going all the way down to the conceptual level to some extent so

@reject@ @reject@

you say @reject@

@reject@ intrinsic

@reject@ @reject@ right

@reject@ @reject@

@reject@ right no it's not and that's not affected

i think did you ever get to look at that the rep paper that i send you on the and that problem in english and german carol

carol in ninety three

@reject@ that's an tactic

@reject@ you that's an tactic fucking factors do payroll there whether you're more likely to develop trust i said did you towards using an excessive sex turned six reference frames

it seems to me that you can get both in english depending on you know like

all right i can so give you a part of their paper from mind which is the ultimate x. sodomy a preference frames

it's special reference frames you actually have already

it's special reference frames you actually have already

actually you have only have two choices you can either do it to point

which is you feel it would be already go play that's a centered

in some cases speak already goal is the same that's the reference object

the origin so that would be origin in english right

you can actually say things like it's behind the tree from me or something like that i think in certain circumstances in england right incidents

and then here you understand

hardly ever use but it's

he's very interested in that so

one and you just put on the web page

just went and then that to me of especially description of it though senate

but it's something that i didn't know until about a week ago or so is there are separate brain areas four things within reach reaching things that are out of reach so there's

so there's all this linguistics about you know near and far or you on and so forth so this is

that they do m. r. i and if you or got something within reach then there's one clip your areas lights up into some things out

up into some things out of reach a different one

at distance thing so they just difficult task to subdivisions there's

to subdivisions there's a line on the wall over there and you get laser pointer and you say where's the midpoint

if you give the line into touch it they can't

it's just that part of the brain isn't functioning so they can't do the here's

a real experiment same

same thing on the wall human laser where's it

give a stack long stick and say do it they can't do it

yes so there's a re mapping of distance space into nearby space

it's not within reach

it's not within reach and use that within reach mechanism i'll

mechanism i'll they dig up reference and so this

and so this start this is the first explain

i have had experience not often but a certain numbers of times and for example i'm working with a pool a screwdriver something for a long time i start feeling the tip directly

that you actually can feel the tip and people who

what's going on at the end of the two the tip and people who are accomplish my violinist and like that claim they also have this kind of thing where you get a direct sensation of physical sensation of d. and a factor

what's going on at the end of the two d. and a factor

it feels like you were as if you were you nor had extended themselves out to this pool and you're feeling forces on yet and so forth and

@reject@ @reject@ i right

that's i said this was the first actual experimental evidence i'd seen it was consistent with this anecdotal

and of course it makes a lovely deaf that story about why languages make this the fish of course the behavioral

fish of course the behavioral differences two things you can reach

exactly so addition the ego in aloe centric which appear older especially also have this partial but still thing which is very deeply embedded

then nintendo sort of he does

of he does see or is it the cognitive from world down in santa barbara and

and he always talks about these he already

this isn't a lot of behavioral but probably most talking about doing this evidence is talking about these small scares basis that you can manipulated versus large scale environmental justice

starting the crops and outward all done with them is starting to do science

that come up so we're not using their system that means we need our system it

and we're going to start on that in parallel with the the grammar

allergies and we build departure and around that or is there a particular

of face but it now seems that there's a good shot at so we've talked

so we've talked about it

about it and the hope is that we can make these things the same

you used to someone is trying to do this

where'd actually is covers the whole range of things

to do and he insisted on trying to do it with the limited set of mechanisms that

it just was just terribly frustrating form

right he seem fully committed to both sides of this if you reconcile a boy thing
